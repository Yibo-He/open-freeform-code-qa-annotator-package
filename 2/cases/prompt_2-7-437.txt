Xdebug 3 - The setting 'xdebug.remote_***' has been renamed, see the upgrading guide

I just installed Xdebug v3.0.0beta1 on my OSX and tried to use it on PhpStorm 2020.1, but I get this :
> Xdebug: [Config] The setting 'xdebug.remote_enable' has been renamed,
see the upgrading guide at
[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable)

guide at
[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port)
And the links provided lead to nothing but an image with bugs.
My question is what are the right settings to set and where to actually change them since i have nothing about xdebug in my php.ini file.
