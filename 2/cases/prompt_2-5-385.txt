I have upgraded my Android Studio and after that I'm facing this error:
```
Gradle sync failed: Plugin [id: 'com.android.application', version: '7.1.2', apply: false] was not found in any of the following sources:
                - Gradle Core Plugins (plugin is not in 'org.gradle' namespace)
                - Plugin Repositories (could not resolve plugin artifact 'com.android.application:com.android.application.gradle.plugin:7.1.2')
                Searched in the following repositories:
                Gradle Central Plugin Repository
                Google
                MavenRepo (24 s 586 ms)
```

I have upgraded JDK to 11 but it didn't fix the error. What else can I do?
