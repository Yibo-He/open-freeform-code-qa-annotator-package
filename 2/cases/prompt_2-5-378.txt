What is best way of reading test data from CSV file with JUnit 5?

What is best/suggested way of reading test data from CSV file with JUnit 5?

Assuming one line is one test case, one column is one parameter, number of columns is fixed and different columns can have different (basic) types: String, int, double. 

An example would be:

```
public class Test{

    @Test
    // ready to use annotation that may load parameters from each line 
    public void shouldCalculateDiscount(String column1, long column2, double column3) {
        assertEquals(5, column1.length());
        assertEquals(column3, column2, 0.0001);
    }
}
```


CSV file example:

```
column1,column2,column3
a,0,0.0
abcde,1,1.01
a-b-c,999,999.0
```


Approach that uses annotations would be perfect, probably something analogical to JUnit's @ParameterizedTest.
