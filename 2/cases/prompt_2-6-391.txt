Should static files be included in a Docker Image?

I have a .NET microservice running as a docker container that is responsible for sending emails to customers. These emails contains additional banner which is a png file.
Should that file be included in my Docker Image during build process? Is it a good practise at all?
Is it a better approach to upload the file to an already built container or linked the file stored in different place?
Dockerfile
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-buster-slim AS base

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-buster-slim AS build

WORKDIR /src

COPY src/Email.Service/Email.Service.csproj .
COPY nuget.config .

RUN dotnet restore Email.Service.csproj --configfile nuget.config

COPY src/Email.Service .

RUN dotnet build Email.Service.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish

RUN dotnet publish Email.Service.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=publish /app .

COPY src/Email.Service/Assets Assets

ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet" ]
CMD [ "Email.Service.dll" ]
```

banner.png lives in Assets directory in the project.
