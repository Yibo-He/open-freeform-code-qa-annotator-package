Add Swagger description to minimal .NET6 APIs

I have a small project in .NET6 that contains minimal APIs like that one
```
app.MapGet("/clients",
     async (IClientRepository repo) =>
     {
          var results = await repo.GetClientsAsync();
          return mapper.Map<IEnumerable<ClientModel>>(results);
     });
```

In the `SwaggerUI` I can use this API but I can't find a way to add description to it (although in the project settings I check for creating an API XML documentation).

How can I add the XML comment?
