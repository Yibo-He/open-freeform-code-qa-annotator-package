Java trim() : Cleanest way to check null string before trimming?

I use `trim()` method in order to trim leading and trailing whitespaces in some of the string field.
```
siteRequest.getName().trim();
```

However, when string field is null, it throws exception as expected. I can check the values before trimming as shown below:
```
siteRequest.getName() ? siteRequest.getName() : siteRequest.getName().trim();
```

However, if it is possible I would prefer a cleaner way so that several people had already faced this problem. Any suggestion with a smarter approach?
