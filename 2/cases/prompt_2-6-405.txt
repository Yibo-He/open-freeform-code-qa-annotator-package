Why asp.net core sending empty object as response?

When I debug the code in VS, the cities list, which I am returning have 3 objects in it along with the properties. When I call this endpoint I am receiving a response of 3 list items of empty objects. 

How to resolve this issue?


# Model Class:



```
public class City
{
    public string CityName;
    public string AssociatedCities; 
    public string Province;
    public int Status;

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```



# Endpoint:



```
[HttpGet]
[Route("cities")]
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<City>> GetCities()
{
    return Ok(Cities);
}
```


This is how I am calling the endpoint

```
getCities() {
  this.http.get<City[]>('/api/wizard/cities')
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log(result);
    this.cities = result;
  }, error => console.error('Something went wrong : ' + error));
}
```


The response I get:

The response that is needed:

```
[
  {
    "SearchCity": "Toronto",
    "AssociatedCities": "Ajax, Whitby, Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton",
    "Province": "ON",
    "Status": 1
  },
  {
    "SearchCity": "Vancouver",
    "AssociatedCities": "Vancouver, Vancouver City",
    "Province": "BC",
    "Status": 1
  }
]
```
