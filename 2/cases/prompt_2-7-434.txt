New alternative for getDoctrine() in Symfony 5.4 and up

As my IDE points out, the `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is now deprecated.
I haven't found any reference for this deprecation neither in the official documentation nor in the Github changelog.
What is the new alternative or workaround for this shortcut?
