Composer require ext-zip fails

I am told by PHPStorm that I need to composer require ext-zip, however, that command is failing...

PHPStorm says

The command I am issuing is

```
composer require ext-zip
```


results in

```
Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.
```


and

```
Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json to its original content.
```
