File is locked by Visual Studio 2019

I have a weird problem in Visual Studio:
if an  during the debugging process I'm not able to build my
C# application:
```
Unable to copy file "C:\Projects\A\bin\A.dll" to "..\..\bin\A.dll". 
  The process cannot access the file '..\..\bin\A.dll' because it is being used 
  by another process.

Could not copy "C:\Projects\A\bin\A.dll" to "..\..\bin\A.dll". 
  Exceeded retry count of 10. Failed. 
  The file is locked by: "Microsoft Visual Studio 2019 (14904)"
```

Is there a permanent solution to solve this strange error? (my only workaround is currently to restart Visual Studio)
What I tried and not worked for me:
- - - - - 
It's also not practical to insert Pre-build event scripts in all of my projects! Link: [https://blog.ndepend.com/visual-studio-script-saves-time-pain/](https://blog.ndepend.com/visual-studio-script-saves-time-pain/)
Does anyone have a solution to this problem?
