Nullable reference type in C#8 when using DTO classes with an ORM

I activated this feature in a project having data transfer object (DTO) classes, as given below:

```
public class Connection
    {
        public string ServiceUrl { get; set; }
        public string? UserName { get; set; }
        public string? Password { get; set; }
        //... others 
    }
```


But I get the error:

> `CS8618`: Non-nullable property 'ServiceUrl' is uninitialized. Consider declaring the property as nullable.

This is a DTO class, so I'm not initializing the properties. This will be the responsibility of the code initializing the class to ensure that the properties are non-null. 

For example, the caller can do:

```
var connection = new Connection
{
  ServiceUrl=some_value,
  //...
}
```


My question: How to handle such errors in DTO classes when C#8's nullability context is enabled?
