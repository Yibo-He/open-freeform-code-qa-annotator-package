How to set SameSite cookie attribute to explicit None ASP NET Core

Chrome 76 will begin to support an explicit `SameSite: None` attribute 

[https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/](https://web.dev/samesite-cookies-explained/)

I found that the current implementation of ASP.NET Core treats `SameSiteMode.None` as a no-op and does not send any attribute. How can I add a custom attribute to a cookie and thereby add an explicit `SameSite: None` to the cookie text?

Appending the attribute to the cookie value does not work as HttpResponse.Cookies.Append url-encodes the cookie value.
