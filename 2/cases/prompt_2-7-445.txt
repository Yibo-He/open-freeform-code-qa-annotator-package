Getting current page url on wp-admin/admin dashboard?

Im trying to get the current page url while on the wp-admin/admin dashboard, is it possible?
Im trying to use these codes but i can't seem to get it to work.
```
global $wp;
$current_page = add_query_arg( $wp->query_vars, home_url( $wp->request ) );
```

The output i wanted is like this: `https://example.com/1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=test`
But instead, the output turns like this: `/1/wp-admin/admin.php?page=test&=https://example.com/1`
Any help is greatly appreciated
