Force retesting or disable test caching



When I run the same go test twice the second run is not done at all. The results are the cached ones from the first run.

```
PASS    
ok      tester/apitests    (cached)
```




I already checked [https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags) but there is no cli flag for that purpose.
