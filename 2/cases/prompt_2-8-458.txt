"package XXX is not in GOROOT" when building a Go project

I have a weird issue that arose when I took a break from this project. Upon starting up Goland, I'm riddled with errors when trying to run my project. 

The specific error, when building one of my packages, is: 
`start.go: package project/game is not in GOROOT (C:\Go\src\project\game)`

I have a folder structure as such under `C:\Users\username`

```
go
|-src
   |-project
        |-game
            |-entity
                 |-whatever.go
            |-game_stuff.go
        |-server
```


and my env vars are as such:

```
GOROOT=C:\Go 
GOPATH=C:\Users\ketchup\go
```


for each of the modules (project/game/entity, project/game, project/server), I did a `git mod init`. 

When building, Goland will try to run this:

```
C:\Go\bin\go.exe build -o C:\Users\ketchup\AppData\Local\Temp\___go_build_project_server.exe project/server
```


and return the error.

Can anyone help me with this issue? Kind of lost since Goland was working fine the last time I opened it. Also not even sure what direction to look at - I'm pretty new to Go and I'm not really sure what documentation to look at :\  Thank you everyone!
