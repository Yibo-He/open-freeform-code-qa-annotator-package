Entity Framework - [Keyless] Data Annotation Missing

According with the Microsoft Documentation [Here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/modeling/keyless-entity-types?tabs=data-annotations), I should have access to the Attribute for [Keyless] so I can define my Model has Keyless, so that in my DBContext I could have something like:

```
public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }
```


And use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)`, without having the need to add a PK to it.
I have the reference to `System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations` and all the Attributes except Keyless are there, what am I missing here?
