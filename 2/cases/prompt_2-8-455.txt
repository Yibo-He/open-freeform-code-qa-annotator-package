Best way to parse a string to an enum

I have an enum as follows
```
type Capability int

const (
    Read   Capability = iota // Read   = 0
    Create                   // Create = 1
    Update                   // Update = 2
    Delete                   // Delete = 3
    List                     // List   = 4
)
```

I want to be able to get the string representation from the enum  parse a string to get the enum.
I get the string from the enum as follows.
```
capabilityStrs := []string{"read", "create", "update", "delete", "list"}
func (c Capability) String() string {
    return capabilityStrs[c]
}
```

How do I parse a string into an enum such that a call to `ParseSTring("read") gives me`Read`. What is the Best way to go about this?
