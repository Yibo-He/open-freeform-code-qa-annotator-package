How to use Jpackage to make a distribution format for JavaFX applications

since .jar is not anymore the best format to use to distribute our JavaFX project, I'm willing to use the tool JPackage for that instead, but after reading this post : [https://stackoverflow.com/a/68823040/4262407](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68823040/4262407), I ended up having multiple questions, but first of all, I just wanna make sure I ve well understood the process that I should follow :
the process :
1-create a modular project
2-package the project in a .jar format
3-use the tool Jlink to create a customized run-time image (to reduce the size of the output)
4-use the tool jpackage (it takes 2 and 3 as inputs)
I'm also wondering if I can rely on Intellij artifacts to create the .jar file (the 2 step) is it better to use a specific plugin ?
The last thing that is not clear is do we need to include the dependencies in the .jar file ? since I believe they will be included in the customized run time, won't they?
