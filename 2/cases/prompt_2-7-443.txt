How to pass an array to Laravel Route parameter

I wanted to pass a value of typed `array` to my route parameter, the array could be in any size and a different key-value pairs each time.
```
Route::get('/example/{array}', ...
```

So if I have an array like this:
```
$array = [
  'a' => 'one',
  'b' => 1,
  ...
]
```

I did this but knew already it ain't gonna work because it looks like I'm passing values to my route parameters named `a`, `b`, etc.
```
route('route.name', $array)
```

As expected the error says:
> ... [Missing parameter: array]
So I used the `serialize()`.
```
route('route.name', serialize($array))
```

I'm still getting an error, something like:
> [Missing parameter: s:1:"a";i:1;s:1:"b";i:2;]
What am I missing ? I also don't understand what the last error says.
