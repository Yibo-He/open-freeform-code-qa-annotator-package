TypeError: expressJwt is not a function

I'm trying to write middleware for user authorization in my app. I use this function to check if a route requires being sign in.
The code is as follows:
```
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt'); 

exports.requireSignin = expressJwt({
secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
algorithms: ["HS256"],
userProperty: "auth",});
```

However, I get the following error:
```
TypeError: expressJwt is not a function at Object.<anonymous> (path to the file)\
```

What could be the problem? None of the other answers seem to be helpful.
