Adding Entity Framework Model on Visual Studio 2022

I am using Visual Studio 2022 with.Net 6.0, I installed Entity Framework 6.4.4 after adding it when I create an Entity Framework model. I am getting a Popup message saying that.
> The project's target framework does not contain Entity Framework runtime assemblies. Please review the target framework information on the project's property page.
Can somebody tell us how to solve that problem?
