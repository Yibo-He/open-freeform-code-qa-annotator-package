ASP.NET Core return JSON with status code

I'm looking for the correct way to return JSON with a HTTP status code in my .NET Core Web API controller. I use to use it like this:

```
public IHttpActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return this.Content(HttpStatusCode.OK, new { response = "Hello"});
}
```


This was in a 4.6 MVC application but now with .NET Core I don't seem to have this `IHttpActionResult` I have `ActionResult` and using like this:

```
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok(Json("123"));
}
```


But the response from the server is weird, as in the image below:

I just want the Web API controller to return JSON with a HTTP status code like I did in Web API 2.
