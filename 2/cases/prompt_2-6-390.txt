Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The issuer is invalid"

I have a simple web api project, which looks like this:

```
[Authorize]
        [Route("Get")]
        public ActionResult<string> SayHello()
        {
            return "Hello World";
        }
```


I am trying to test it with Postman.  By following the steps here: [https://kevinchalet.com/2016/07/13/creating-your-own-openid-connect-server-with-asos-testing-your-authorization-server-with-postman/](https://kevinchalet.com/2016/07/13/creating-your-own-openid-connect-server-with-asos-testing-your-authorization-server-with-postman/)

1) Send the request below and receive a token as expected:

2) Attempt to send another request with the authorization token as shown below:

Why do I get a 401 (unauthorized) error? The WWW-Authenticate response header says: Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The issuer is invalid".  I am using .Net Core 3.1.  I have commented out the sensitive information in the screenshots.

The web api works as expected when accessed from an MVC application.

Here is the startup code:

```
services.AddAuthentication("Bearer")
                .AddIdentityServerAuthentication(options =>
                {
                    options.Authority = identityUrl; //identityurl is a config item
                    options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
                    options.ApiName = apiName;

                });
```
