Unable to resolve ILogger from Microsoft.Extensions.Logging

I've configured my console application's `Main` like so
```
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```

And then I try to use it in another class like so
```
private readonly ILogger _logger;
    
public MyClass(ILogger logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```

> System.InvalidOperationException: 'Unable to resolve service for type
'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger'
I've tried the solutions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51329388/2025666) but it didn't work for me.

Based on Yaakov's comment below and [this Github comment](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/issues/92#issuecomment-223991293) I'm able to resolve it correctly by doing this
```
public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}
```

I would have preferred to have this in the initial `BuildServiceProvider` but looks like I'm gonna have to repeat this every time I want to use the logger (or create my own ILogger).
