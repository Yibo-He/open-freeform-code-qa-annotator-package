How to download the latest build artifacts from Azure DevOps programmatically?

I have a .NET C# application and I would like to download the latest artifacts generated by the latest build of this public Azure DevOps project:

[https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_build?definitionId=3](https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_build?definitionId=3)

How does one interface with Azure DevOps to download the artifacts for such a task? 

I have in mind to use an HttpClient to download the zipped artifacts using some special URL.
