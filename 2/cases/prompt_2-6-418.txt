Does C# perform short circuit evaluation of if statements with await?

I believe that C# stops evaluating an if statement condition as soon as it is able to tell the outcome. So for example:
```
if ( (1 < 0) && check_something_else() )
    // this will not be called
```

Since the condition `(1 < 0)` evaluates as `false`, the `&&` condition cannot be met, and `check_something_else()` will not be called.
How does C# evaluate an if statement with asynchronous functions? Does it wait for both to return? So for example:
```
if( await first_check() && await second_check() )
    // ???
```

Will this ever be short-circuited?
