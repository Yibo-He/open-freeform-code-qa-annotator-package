How to mock class with @ConfigurationProperties in Spring Boot

I have a class that Autowires another class with @ConfigurationProperties.

### Class with @ConfigurationProperties


```
@ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "report")
public class SomeProperties {
    private String property1;
    private String property2;
...
```


### Class that Autowires above class SomeProperties


```
@Service
@Transactional
public class SomeService {
    ....
    @Autowired
    private SomeProperties someProperties;
    .... // There are other things
```

Now, I want to test  class and in my test class when I mock  class, I am getting `null` value for all the properties.

### Test class


```
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
@SpringBootTest(classes = SomeProperties.class)
@ActiveProfiles("test")
@EnableConfigurationProperties
public class SomeServiceTest {
    @InjectMocks
    private SomeService someService;

    @Mock // I tried @MockBean as well, it did not work
    private SomeProperties someProperties;
```

How can I mock  having properties from `application-test.properties` file.
