What is the difference between @RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject)) and @RequiredArgsConstructor?

What is the difference between Lombok's 

```
@RequiredArgsConstructor
```


and 

```
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))
```


I know that `RequiredArgsConstructor` injects all the final dependencies in constructor only.
