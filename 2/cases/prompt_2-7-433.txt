Composer error while Composer update in cpanel

I have a Laravel project in, which laravel version is 8.75 and php version is 7.4.
When I upload my project in cpanel and go to terminal and run 'composer update' command ,it shows this type of error. I search this error but couldn't find any solution.
$ composer update
