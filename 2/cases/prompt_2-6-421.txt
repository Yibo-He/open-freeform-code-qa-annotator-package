OnInitializedAsync() in blazor

I have used `OnInitializedAsync()` in my code. In that hook, I am fetching data.
In markup, I have checked whether data is null or not. But I found that data checked is executed before the `onInitalizedAsync()` triggered. Meanwhile, after getting data too, data checked is executed.
I have checked the blazor documents but struggling to find why it triggered at first.
```
<Component1>
  @if (Data != null)
      {
        @foreach (var item in Data) {
             <Component2>
        }
       }
</Componet1>

@code{
  protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync() {
       Data = //data from dataBase
  }
}
```

I need to execute data checked only after data fetch. Can anyone guide me to fix this issue?
