How can I read the appsettings.json in a .Net 6 console application?

I try to create a .Net 6 Console Application but having troubles reading my appsettings.json file. In a web application I could use this...
```
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args);
```

But what would I use in a console application? I get this error when trying to add it to program.cs. `"The name 'WebApplication' does not exist in the current context"`
