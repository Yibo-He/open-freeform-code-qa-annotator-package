I'am trying to make a bulk insert with sqlx and golang : 

```
for _, result := range results {
            queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)`
            db.MustExec(queryInsert,result.Com1,result.Com2,result.Path,result.Time)
            queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`
            db.MustExec(queryUpdate,result.Com1,result.Com2)
        }
```


That code works but it's slow.

I've tried this :

```
tx := db.MustBegin()
for _, result := range results {
        queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)`
        tx.MustExec(queryInsert,result.Com1,result.Com2,result.Path,result.Time)
        queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`
        tx.MustExec(queryUpdate,result.Com1,result.Com2)
    }
tx.Commit()
```


but it does nothing when i look at my records i doesn't see any records.

Regards

edit : 

```
INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4),($2,$3,$4,$5),($3,$4,$5,$6),($4,$5,$6,$7),($5,$6,$7,$8),($6,$7,$8,$9),($7,$8,$9,$10),($8,$9,$10,$11),($9,$10,$11,$12),($10,$11,$12,$13)
UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE (com1 = $1 AND com2 = $2 )  OR (com1 = $2 AND com2 = $3 )  OR (com1 = $3 AND com2 = $4 )  OR (com1 = $4 AND com2 = $5 )  OR (com1 = $5 AND com2 = $6 )  OR (com1 = $6 AND com2 = $7 )  OR (com1 = $7 AND com2 = $8 )  OR (com1 = $8 AND com2 = $9 )  OR (com1 = $9 AND com2 = $10 )  OR (com1 = $10 AND com2 = $11 ) 
panic: pq: column "com2" is of type integer but expression is of type text
```

It seems like you are trying to insert values of different types into the `com2` column. Please make sure that the data type of the `com2` column in your database matches the data type of the `result.Com2` variable in your code. 

Also, you can try using a single SQL statement with multiple value sets for bulk insertion, like this:

```
query := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES `
values := []interface{}{}
for _, result := range results {
    query += `($1,$2,$3,$4),`
    values = append(values, result.Com1, result.Com2, result.Path, result.Time)
}
query = query[:len(query)-1] // remove the last comma
_, err := db.Exec(query, values...)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

This will create a single SQL statement with multiple value sets, which can be executed in a single transaction for faster insertion.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like there is a type mismatch between the column "com2" and the value being passed in the query. Make sure that the data type of the "com2" column in the database table matches the data type of the value being passed in the query. 

Also, you can try using a prepared statement instead of a regular query to improve performance. Here's an example:

```
// Prepare the insert statement
stmt, err := tx.PrepareNamed(`INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES (:com1,:com2,:path,:time)`)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// Loop through the results and execute the insert statement
for _, result := range results {
    _, err = stmt.Exec(result)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // Execute the update statement
    _, err = tx.Exec(`UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`, result.Com1, result.Com2)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}

// Commit the transaction
err = tx.Commit()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

This code uses a prepared statement to insert the data into the "DataCom_travel" table. The `PrepareNamed` function prepares the statement with named parameters, which makes it easier to read and maintain. The `Exec` function executes the statement with the values from the `result` struct.

Also, note that the update statement is executed inside the loop, just like before.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like there is a type mismatch between the `com2` column in your `DataCom_travel` table and the value being passed in the bulk insert. 

Make sure that the `com2` column in your table is of type `text` or `varchar` if you are passing a string value. If it is of type `integer`, you will need to convert the value to an integer before passing it in the insert statement.

You can also try using the `NamedExec` function instead of `MustExec` to pass in a struct with named fields instead of positional arguments. This can make your code more readable and easier to maintain. Here's an example:

```
type Travel struct {
    Com1 string `db:"com1"`
    Com2 string `db:"com2"`
    Path string `db:"path"`
    Time int    `db:"time"`
}

tx := db.MustBegin()
for _, result := range results {
    travel := Travel{
        Com1: result.Com1,
        Com2: result.Com2,
        Path: result.Path,
        Time: result.Time,
    }
    queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES (:com1,:com2,:path,:time)`
    tx.NamedExec(queryInsert, travel)
    queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 = :com1 and com2 = :com2`
    tx.NamedExec(queryUpdate, travel)
}
tx.Commit()
```

This code uses a struct to represent the data being inserted, and the `NamedExec` function to pass in the struct with named fields. This can make it easier to read and maintain your code.
