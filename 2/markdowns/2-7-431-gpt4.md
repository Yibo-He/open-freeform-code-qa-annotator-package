how can I increase the laravel 8  `dd()` limitations? I have lots of nested relationship and I cant view most of them due to many data. For example this
```
#relations: array:4 [▼
    "activecourses" => Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#1346 ▼
      #items: array:3 [▼
        0 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1353 ▶}
        1 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1354 ▼
          #guarded: []
          #connection: "mysql"
          #table: "studentcourses"
          #primaryKey: "id"
          #keyType: "int"
          +incrementing: true
          #with: []
          #withCount: []
          +preventsLazyLoading: false
          #perPage: 15
          +exists: true
          +wasRecentlyCreated: false
          #escapeWhenCastingToString: false
          #attributes: array:22 [ …22]
          #original: array:22 [ …22]
          #changes: []
          #casts: []
          #classCastCache: []
          #attributeCastCache: []
          #dates: []
          #dateFormat: null
          #appends: []
          #dispatchesEvents: []
          #observables: []
          #relations: array:1 [ …1]
          #touches: []
          +timestamps: true
          #hidden: []
          #visible: []
          #fillable: []
        }
        2 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1355 ▶}
      ]
      #escapeWhenCastingToString: false
    }
```

I found this link [Laravel dd function limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39011241/laravel-dd-function-limitations) but I think its outdated since the new dd function for laravel 8 is
this is from vendor folder.
```
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\VarDumper;

if (!function_exists('dump')) {
    /**
     * @author Nicolas Grekas <p@tchwork.com>
     */
    function dump($var, ...$moreVars)
    {
        VarDumper::dump($var);

        foreach ($moreVars as $v) {
            VarDumper::dump($v);
        }

        if (1 < func_num_args()) {
            return func_get_args();
        }

        return $var;
    }
}

if (!function_exists('dd')) {
    /**
     * @return never
     */
    function dd(...$vars)
    {
        if (!in_array(\PHP_SAPI, ['cli', 'phpdbg'], true) && !headers_sent()) {
            header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error');
        }

        foreach ($vars as $v) {
            VarDumper::dump($v);
        }

        exit(1);
    }
}
```

Tried adding this lines before `dd()` but doesnt work
```
ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_depth', 100);
   ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_children', 2000);
   ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_data', 2000);
```

Is there any way or alternative in viewing nested data? I dont want to use `var_dump` or `print_r` since the browser becomes slow when there are lots of data. Thanks in advance.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The `dd()` function in Laravel uses the Symfony VarDumper component under the hood. This component has a configuration to limit the depth of the output, which is set to 20 levels deep by default. This is likely the limitation you're running into.

You can increase this limit by creating a new instance of the `VarDumper` class with a higher max depth. Here's how you can do it:

```php
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Cloner\VarCloner;
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Dumper\HtmlDumper;

$cloner = new VarCloner();
$cloner->setMaxItems(-1); // No limit
$cloner->setMaxString(-1); // No limit
$cloner->setMaxDepth(100); // Increase this to increase depth

$dumper = new HtmlDumper();
$dumper->dump($cloner->cloneVar($yourVariable));
```

Replace `$yourVariable` with the variable you want to dump.

This will output the dumped variable in your browser, similar to `dd()`, but with a higher depth limit.

As for the `ini_set` lines you tried, they only affect the `var_dump` function and have no effect on `dd()` or the VarDumper component.

If you find yourself needing to do this often, you might want to consider creating a helper function or a service that does this for you.

Also, if you're dealing with large collections of Eloquent models, you might want to look into using `->load()` or `->with()` to eager load the relationships you need. This can help reduce the size and complexity of the data you're dealing with.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The `dd()` function in Laravel uses the Symfony VarDumper component, which has a default maximum depth level of 20. This means that any array or object that is nested more than 20 levels deep will not be fully displayed.

You can change this default maximum depth level by creating a new instance of the `VarDumper` class and calling the `setMaxDepth()` method on it. However, this is not recommended because it can lead to performance issues if the depth level is set too high.

Instead of trying to increase the maximum depth level, a better approach might be to limit the amount of data that you are trying to dump at once. For example, instead of dumping an entire collection, you could dump only the first few items in the collection.

If you need to inspect a large amount of data, you might want to consider using a debugging tool like Xdebug or Laravel Debugbar. These tools provide a more user-friendly interface for inspecting data and can handle larger amounts of data more efficiently than `dd()`.

Alternatively, you can use the `toArray()` or `toJson()` methods to convert the collection to an array or JSON format, which can then be inspected more easily. For example:

```php
dd($collection->toArray());
```

or

```php
dd($collection->toJson());
```

These methods will give you a more manageable representation of the data that you can then inspect in your browser or text editor.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `dd()` function in Laravel uses the Symfony VarDumper component, which has a default maximum depth of 20 levels. This is to prevent memory issues when dumping large or complex data structures.

If you want to increase the maximum depth, you can create a `VarDumper` instance and configure it yourself. Here's an example:

```php
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Cloner\VarCloner;
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\Dumper\HtmlDumper;

$cloner = new VarCloner();
$cloner->setMaxItems(-1); // No limit
$cloner->setMaxString(-1); // No limit
$cloner->setMaxDepth(100); // Increase depth to 100

$dumper = new HtmlDumper();
$dumper->dump($cloner->cloneVar($yourVariable));
```

This will dump your variable with the new settings.

Alternatively, you can use a package like Laravel Debugbar or Laravel Telescope which provide more advanced debugging tools and can handle larger data structures.

Another option is to log the data instead of dumping it. This can be done using Laravel's logging functions, which can handle large data structures and won't slow down your browser:

```php
\Log::info(print_r($yourVariable, true));
```

This will write the data to your log file, which you can then view at your leisure.
