I am trying to build an application which was built using java 8, now it's upgraded to java 11. I installed [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) using [an oracle article](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/installation-jdk-microsoft-windows-platforms.html#GUID-A7E27B90-A28D-4237-9383-A58B416071CA) in my  and I use  as my IDE.

I changed my system environment variables and set the 

```
JAVA_HOME to C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1
```


And added that to the `Path` variable.

```
C:\>java -version
java version "11.0.1" 2018-10-16 LTS
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM 18.9 (build 11.0.1+13-LTS, mixed mode)
```


When I build my application in IntelliJ, this is what I get:

```
Information:java: Errors occurred while compiling module 'test-domain_main'
Information: javac 1.8.0_171 was used to compile java sources
Information:1/10/2019 4:21 PM - Compilation completed with 1 error and 0 warnings in 1s 199ms
Error:java: invalid target release: 11
```


This is what I've tried so far:


1. I changed .idea/compiler.xml target values from 8 to 11 but that didn't help. Also, verified the Target bytecode version in settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler and all my modules are set to 11.
2. Went to file > Project Structure > SDKs *(currently I have 1.7 and 1.7 listed)* > Add new SDK > JDK > After that, I selected C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1 But it errors out with "The selected directory is not a valid home for JDK"



I am not sure if I installed the wrong JDK 11, because in my `C:\Program Files\Java\`, I see separate JDK and JRE folders for `1.7` and `1.8` but only JDK folder for `11.0.1`

Or is it something else I need to change?

The error message you're seeing suggests that IntelliJ is still using an older version of the Java compiler (javac) to build your project. Here are some steps to ensure that IntelliJ is using the correct JDK:

1. **Check the Project SDK:** Go to `File > Project Structure > Project`. In the `Project SDK` field, make sure that the JDK 11 is selected. If it's not, select it from the dropdown menu. If it's not in the dropdown menu, click `New > JDK` and navigate to the location of your JDK 11 installation.

2. **Check the Module SDK:** In the same `Project Structure` window, click on `Modules` in the left-hand panel. For each module, make sure that the `Module SDK` is either set to the same JDK 11 or is set to `Project SDK` (which should be JDK 11 if you followed the previous step).

3. **Check the Java Compiler settings:** Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler`. In the `Target bytecode version` field, make sure that `11` is selected. If it's not, select it from the dropdown menu.

4. **Check the Maven or Gradle settings:** If you're using Maven or Gradle, you'll also need to make sure that these tools are using the correct JDK. For Maven, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Maven > Importing`. In the `JDK for importer` field, select the JDK 11. For Gradle, go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Build Tools > Gradle`. In the `Gradle JVM` field, select the JDK 11.

Regarding the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, the JRE is no longer shipped as a separate module. Instead, it's included in the JDK, so it's normal to only see a JDK folder for Java 11.

If you've followed all these steps and you're still seeing the error, it might be worth trying to reinstall the JDK 11 and making sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is pointing to the correct location.

The error message "invalid target release: 11" means that the Java compiler version that IntelliJ IDEA is using does not support Java 11. 

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Project SDK**: Go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and check the `Project SDK` field. It should be set to your installed JDK 11. If it's not, change it to JDK 11.

2. **Check the Module SDK**: In the same `Project Structure` window, go to `Modules`, select your module, and check the `Module SDK` field. It should also be set to JDK 11. If it's not, change it to JDK 11.

3. **Check the Java Compiler version**: Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and check the `Target bytecode version` for your module. It should be set to 11. If it's not, change it to 11.

4. **Check the Maven Compiler Plugin**: If you're using Maven, check the configuration of the Maven Compiler Plugin in your `pom.xml` file. It should look something like this:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <source>11</source>
        <target>11</target>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

5. **Check the Gradle Java version**: If you're using Gradle, check the Java version in your `build.gradle` file. It should look something like this:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = '11'
targetCompatibility = '11'
```

As for the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions only. The JRE is essentially a subset of the JDK and its use is not recommended for most development scenarios. So it's normal to see only the JDK folder for Java 11.

If you've checked all these settings and you're still getting the error, you might need to restart IntelliJ IDEA or invalidate the caches (`File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...`) to make sure the changes take effect.

The error message "invalid target release: 11" indicates that the Java compiler version that IntelliJ IDEA is using does not support Java 11. 

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File` > `Project Structure` > `Project Settings` > `Project`.
3. In the `Project SDK` section, select the correct JDK version (11 in your case). If it's not listed, click `New` > `JDK` and then navigate to the location where you installed JDK 11.
4. In the `Project language level` field, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
5. Click `OK` to save the changes.

If you still encounter the same issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Compiler` > `Java Compiler`.
2. In the `Target bytecode version` section, select `11` for all modules.
3. Click `OK` to save the changes.

Regarding your question about the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions without a separate JRE. This is because the JRE can be created from the JDK via the `jlink` tool. So, it's normal to see only the JDK folder for Java 11.

If you're still having trouble, please ensure that you've installed the correct version of JDK 11. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). After downloading, install it and make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the correct path.
