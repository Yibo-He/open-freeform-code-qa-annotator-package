I want to uninstall Eclipse version Mars 2, but it doesn't appear in the "Programs and Features" area of the Windows Control Panel. The installer has installed start menu shortcuts and other artifacts, so it's not just a matter of deleting the installation folder.

Eclipse doesn't have a traditional installer on Windows. It's essentially a portable application that you can run from anywhere. The installer simply extracts the files to a location and creates shortcuts. 

Here are the steps to manually uninstall Eclipse:

1. Delete the Eclipse directory: The installer should have prompted you to choose a directory when you installed Eclipse. Navigate to that directory and delete it. If you can't remember where you installed it, right-click on the Eclipse shortcut, select "Properties", and look at the "Start in" field.

2. Delete the Eclipse workspace: This is a directory that Eclipse uses to store your projects and settings. By default, it's in your user directory (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\eclipse-workspace). If you've changed it, you can find the location by opening Eclipse, going to "File > Switch Workspace > Other...", and looking at the "Workspace" field. Note that this will delete all your projects and settings, so make sure to back up any data you want to keep.

3. Delete the Eclipse shortcuts: Delete any shortcuts in your start menu, desktop, taskbar, etc. You can do this by right-clicking on them and selecting "Delete".

4. Clean up the .p2 directory: Eclipse's installer also creates a directory called .p2 in your user directory (e.g., C:\Users\YourUsername\.p2). This directory contains data about the software that's installed in Eclipse. You can delete this directory, but it might also be used by other Eclipse installations. If you're not sure, it's probably best to leave it.

5. Clean up the environment variables: If you've added Eclipse to your PATH environment variable, you should remove it. You can do this by going to "Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables", finding the PATH variable, and removing the Eclipse directory.

After following these steps, Eclipse should be completely removed from your system.

Eclipse doesn't have a traditional uninstaller. It's essentially a portable application that you can delete to remove. However, it does create some additional files and shortcuts that you might want to remove manually.

Here's how to uninstall Eclipse Mars 2:

1. **Delete the Eclipse directory**: The first step is to delete the directory where Eclipse is installed. By default, it might be in your "Program Files" directory or in your user directory. If you're not sure where it is, you can right-click on the Eclipse shortcut on your desktop or start menu, select "Properties", and look at the "Start in" field.

2. **Delete the workspace directory**: Eclipse creates a workspace directory where it saves your projects and settings. By default, this is in your user directory. If you're not sure where it is, you can check the workspace path in Eclipse (File > Switch Workspace > Other). If you want to keep your projects, make sure to back them up before deleting this directory.

3. **Delete the shortcuts**: You can delete the Eclipse shortcuts from your desktop and start menu by right-clicking on them and selecting "Delete".

4. **Clean up the system environment variables**: Eclipse might have added some system environment variables (like `JAVA_HOME` or `ECLIPSE_HOME`). You can check this by going to Control Panel > System > Advanced system settings > Environment Variables. If you see any Eclipse-related variables, you can delete them.

5. **Clean up the registry**: This step is optional and should be done with caution, as incorrect changes to the registry can cause serious problems. Eclipse might have added some entries to the Windows registry. You can use a registry cleaner like CCleaner, or you can do it manually by pressing Win + R, typing `regedit`, and searching for "eclipse".

Remember to restart your computer after these steps to make sure all changes are applied.

Eclipse does not have a traditional uninstaller, especially if it was installed by simply unzipping a downloaded package. Here are the steps to manually uninstall Eclipse:

1. **Delete the Eclipse directory**: The first step is to delete the Eclipse installation directory. This is the directory where you extracted Eclipse. If you're not sure where this is, you can right-click on the Eclipse shortcut on your desktop or in your start menu, select "Properties", and look at the "Target" field.

2. **Delete the Eclipse workspace**: This is the directory that you selected as your workspace when you first ran Eclipse. It contains all of your projects and settings. If you want to completely remove Eclipse, you can delete this directory. However, if you want to keep your projects for use in another IDE, you should not delete this directory.

3. **Delete the Eclipse settings directory**: Eclipse also stores some settings in a directory in your home directory. On Windows, this is usually `C:\Users\<Your Username>\.eclipse`. You can delete this directory to remove these settings.

4. **Remove the start menu shortcuts**: You can remove the Eclipse shortcuts from your start menu by right-clicking on them and selecting "Delete".

5. **Clean up the PATH environment variable**: If you added Eclipse to your PATH environment variable, you should remove it. You can do this by right-clicking on "Computer" in the start menu, selecting "Properties", then "Advanced system settings", then "Environment Variables". In the "System variables" section, scroll down to "Path", click "Edit", and remove the entry for Eclipse.

6. **Restart your computer**: After you've done all of this, restart your computer to ensure that all changes have taken effect.

Remember to back up any important files before you start deleting directories.
