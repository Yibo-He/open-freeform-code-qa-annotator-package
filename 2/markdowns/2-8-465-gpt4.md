When I run the same go test twice the second run is not done at all. The results are the cached ones from the first run.

```
PASS    
ok      tester/apitests    (cached)
```




I already checked [https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Testing_flags) but there is no cli flag for that purpose.

Go test caching is a feature introduced in Go 1.10 to avoid running the same tests when the code and the environment under which the tests are run remain the same. This can significantly speed up the testing process.

If you want to disable this feature and force the tests to run every time, you can use the `-count=1` flag. This flag sets the cache identifier for the test binary, and by setting it to 1, you're effectively disabling the cache.

So, you can run your tests like this:

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
```

This will force Go to run all tests, even if it has cached results from previous runs.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Go test uses caching to avoid running unnecessary tests. If the test binary and all its inputs remain unchanged, the test will be skipped, and the previous result will be used instead.

If you want to disable test caching, you can use the `-count=1` flag. This will force the tests to run every time:

```
go test -count=1 ./...
```

The `-count` flag sets the number of times to run each test. If you set it to 1, it will disable caching and run the test every time.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Go test uses caching to avoid running unnecessary tests. If the test binary and all its inputs remain unchanged, the test result will be retrieved from the cache instead of running the test again. 

If you want to disable this caching behavior, you can use the `-count=1` flag. This flag specifies the number of times to run each test and it bypasses the cache. 

Here is how you can use it:

```bash
go test -count=1 ./...
```

This will run all tests in your current directory and its subdirectories, and it will bypass the cache. 

Alternatively, you can use the `go clean -testcache` command to clean the test cache:

```bash
go clean -testcache
```

After running this command, the next time you run `go test`, all tests will be run again regardless of whether they were run before.
