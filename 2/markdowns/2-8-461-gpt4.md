I'am trying to make a bulk insert with sqlx and golang : 

```
for _, result := range results {
            queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)`
            db.MustExec(queryInsert,result.Com1,result.Com2,result.Path,result.Time)
            queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`
            db.MustExec(queryUpdate,result.Com1,result.Com2)
        }
```


That code works but it's slow.

I've tried this :

```
tx := db.MustBegin()
for _, result := range results {
        queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)`
        tx.MustExec(queryInsert,result.Com1,result.Com2,result.Path,result.Time)
        queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`
        tx.MustExec(queryUpdate,result.Com1,result.Com2)
    }
tx.Commit()
```


but it does nothing when i look at my records i doesn't see any records.

Regards

edit : 

```
INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4),($2,$3,$4,$5),($3,$4,$5,$6),($4,$5,$6,$7),($5,$6,$7,$8),($6,$7,$8,$9),($7,$8,$9,$10),($8,$9,$10,$11),($9,$10,$11,$12),($10,$11,$12,$13)
UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE (com1 = $1 AND com2 = $2 )  OR (com1 = $2 AND com2 = $3 )  OR (com1 = $3 AND com2 = $4 )  OR (com1 = $4 AND com2 = $5 )  OR (com1 = $5 AND com2 = $6 )  OR (com1 = $6 AND com2 = $7 )  OR (com1 = $7 AND com2 = $8 )  OR (com1 = $8 AND com2 = $9 )  OR (com1 = $9 AND com2 = $10 )  OR (com1 = $10 AND com2 = $11 ) 
panic: pq: column "com2" is of type integer but expression is of type text
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message you're seeing indicates that you're trying to insert a text value into a column that expects an integer. This is likely because you're using placeholders ($1, $2, etc.) in your SQL statements, but the values you're passing in don't match the expected types for the columns.

In your INSERT statement, you're trying to insert values into the com1, com2, path, and time columns. You need to make sure that the types of result.Com1, result.Com2, result.Path, and result.Time match the types of these columns in your database.

In your UPDATE statement, you're comparing the com1 and com2 columns to the values of result.Com1 and result.Com2. Again, you need to make sure these types match.

If com1 and com2 are integer columns, you should make sure that result.Com1 and result.Com2 are integers. If they're currently strings, you'll need to convert them to integers before using them in your SQL statements. You can do this in Go using the strconv.Atoi function:

```go
com1, err := strconv.Atoi(result.Com1)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

com2, err := strconv.Atoi(result.Com2)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Then you can use com1 and com2 in your SQL statements:

```go
tx.MustExec(queryInsert, com1, com2, result.Path, result.Time)
tx.MustExec(queryUpdate, com1, com2)
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing. If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about the types of the columns in your database and the types of the values you're trying to insert.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message "pq: column "com2" is of type integer but expression is of type text" suggests that you're trying to insert a text value into a column that expects an integer. 

The problem is likely in the way you're passing parameters to your SQL query. In your insert query, you're using placeholders like $1, $2, etc., but it seems like the actual values you're passing might not match the expected data types for the columns.

Here's a simplified example of how you might construct your queries:

```go
tx := db.MustBegin()
for _, result := range results {
    queryInsert := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES ($1,$2,$3,$4)`
    tx.MustExec(queryInsert, result.Com1, result.Com2, result.Path, result.Time)
    queryUpdate := `UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`
    tx.MustExec(queryUpdate, result.Com1, result.Com2)
}
err := tx.Commit()
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal(err)
}
```

In this example, I'm passing the actual values (result.Com1, result.Com2, etc.) directly to the MustExec method, rather than trying to include them in the query string. This should ensure that the values are correctly interpreted as integers, not text.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to print out the values of result.Com1, result.Com2, etc. to make sure they're what you expect. If these values are not integers, you'll need to convert them before passing them to MustExec.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message `pq: column "com2" is of type integer but expression is of type text` indicates that you are trying to insert a text value into a column that is of integer type.

In your bulk insert statement, you are using placeholders ($1, $2, etc.) to represent the values you want to insert. However, it seems that the data type of the value you are trying to insert does not match the data type of the column.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that the data types of the values you are inserting match the data types of the columns. If `com2` is an integer column, you should only insert integer values into it.

If `result.Com2` is a string and you are sure that it contains an integer value, you can convert it to an integer before inserting it into the database. In Go, you can use the `strconv.Atoi` function to convert a string to an integer:

```go
com2, err := strconv.Atoi(result.Com2)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

Then, you can use `com2` in your insert statement:

```go
tx.MustExec(queryInsert,result.Com1,com2,result.Path,result.Time)
```

Similarly, you need to ensure that the data types of the values you are using in your update statement match the data types of the columns.
