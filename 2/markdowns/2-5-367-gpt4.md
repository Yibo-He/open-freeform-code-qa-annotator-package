I have a java app with maven.
Junit for tests, with failsafe and surefire plugins.
I have more than 2000 integration tests.
To speed up the test running, I use failsafe jvmfork to run my tests parallel.
I have some heavy test class, and they typically running at end of my test execution and it is slows down my CI verify process.
The filesafe runorder:balanced would be a good option for me, but i cant use it because the jvmfork.
To rename the test classes or move to another package and run it alpahabetical is not an option.
Any suggestion how can I run my slow test classes at the begining of the verify process?

You can use the `runOrder` parameter of the Maven Failsafe plugin to control the order in which tests are run. By default, this parameter is set to `filesystem`, which means that tests are run in the order they are discovered on the file system. However, you can set this parameter to `random`, `hourly`, `alphabetical`, `reversealphabetical`, `failedfirst`, or `balanced`.

Since you can't use `balanced` and renaming or moving test classes is not an option, you might want to consider using `failedfirst`. This option will run tests that failed during the previous run before other tests. This could potentially speed up your CI process by failing faster if a previously failed test is still failing.

Another option could be to split your tests into different profiles based on their execution time and run the profiles containing the slower tests first.

Here is an example of how to set the `runOrder` parameter in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.22.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <runOrder>failedfirst</runOrder>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

And here is an example of how to define profiles:

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>slow-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.22.2</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*SlowTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
    <profile>
        <id>fast-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.22.2</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*FastTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

You can then run the profiles in the order you want:

```bash
mvn verify -P slow-tests,fast-tests
```

You can use the `runOrder` parameter of the Maven Failsafe plugin to control the order in which tests are run. However, as you mentioned, the `balanced` option is not compatible with forked JVMs.

One possible solution is to use the `groups` or `categories` feature of JUnit to separate your slow tests from the faster ones. You can then configure the Failsafe plugin to run the slow tests first.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a marker interface for your slow tests:

```java
public interface SlowTests {}
```

2. Annotate your slow test classes with `@Category(SlowTests.class)`:

```java
import org.junit.experimental.categories.Category;

@Category(SlowTests.class)
public class SlowTest {
    // ...
}
```

3. Configure the Failsafe plugin in your `pom.xml` to run the slow tests first:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>2.22.2</version>
    <configuration>
        <groups>com.example.SlowTests</groups>
    </configuration>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>slow-tests</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>other-tests</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>integration-test</goal>
            </goals>
            <configuration>
                <excludedGroups>com.example.SlowTests</excludedGroups>
            </configuration>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>verify</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>verify</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
```

This configuration will first run the tests marked as slow, then the rest of the tests. The `verify` goal is still run at the end to fail the build if any test failed.

Please note that this solution requires JUnit 4.12 or later. If you're using an older version of JUnit, you might need to upgrade or find a different solution.
