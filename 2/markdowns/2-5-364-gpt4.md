I am trying to run Maven using the Maven wrapper rather than the Maven task.  However, it's failing because it is using an older version of Java.  The JavaInstaller task seems to require a remote source for the JDK, I would rather avoid doing that and use the one that works with Maven task, but I can't find it documented anywhere.

It seems like you're trying to use a specific version of Java with Maven. If you're using the Maven Wrapper, you can specify the Java version in the `pom.xml` file. 

Here's how you can do it:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>3.8.0</version>
            <configuration>
                <source>1.8</source>
                <target>1.8</target>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

In this example, Maven will use Java 1.8. You can replace `1.8` with the version you want to use.

If you want to specify the JDK for the Maven Wrapper, you can do so in the `mvnw` or `mvnw.cmd` script (depending on your OS). There should be a line that looks like this:

```bash
JAVA_HOME=...
```

You can replace the value with the path to the JDK you want to use.

If you're using a continuous integration system, there might be a way to specify the JDK version in the configuration. For example, in Jenkins, you can specify the JDK in the "Global Tool Configuration" section.

If none of these options work for you, please provide more details about your setup, and I'll try to give a more specific answer.

The Maven Wrapper is a shell script used to automatically download and install the correct version of Maven for your project. It's a good way to ensure that everyone working on your project is using the same version of Maven.

If you're having trouble with the Maven Wrapper using an older version of Java, it's likely because the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to point to that older version. The Maven Wrapper uses the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to find the Java installation to use.

Here's how you can change the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

1. Open a terminal.
2. If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, enter the following command to open the bash profile file in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to open the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button, then edit the `JAVA_HOME` variable in the System variables section.

3. Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/java` with the path to your Java installation:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
```

4. Save and close the file.
5. If you're using a Unix-based system, enter the following command to reload the bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, when you run the Maven Wrapper, it should use the correct version of Java.

If you want to avoid downloading JDK from a remote source, you can manually install the JDK on your machine and then point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to that installation. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for MacOS.

The Java version used by Maven can be controlled by setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. The Maven Wrapper is a shell script called `mvnw` (or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows) that automatically detects and downloads the necessary Maven version if it's not already installed. It uses the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to find the Java installation to use.

Here's how you can set `JAVA_HOME` to point to the correct Java version:

1. Find out where your desired Java version is installed. This is usually in a directory like `/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/` on Linux or `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1` on Windows.

2. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to this directory. On Linux or macOS, you can do this in the terminal with the `export` command:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64/
```

On Windows, you can do this in the Command Prompt with the `setx` command:

```cmd
setx JAVA_HOME "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.1"
```

3. Now, when you run the Maven Wrapper with `./mvnw` (or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows), it should use the correct Java version.

Remember that setting an environment variable in this way only affects the current terminal session. If you want to set `JAVA_HOME` permanently, you'll need to add the `export` or `setx` command to your shell's startup script (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` on Linux/macOS, or the System Properties -> Environment Variables dialog on Windows).
