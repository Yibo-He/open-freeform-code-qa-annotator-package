When I debug the code in VS, the cities list, which I am returning have 3 objects in it along with the properties. When I call this endpoint I am receiving a response of 3 list items of empty objects. 

How to resolve this issue?


# Model Class:



```
public class City
{
    public string CityName;
    public string AssociatedCities; 
    public string Province;
    public int Status;

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```



# Endpoint:



```
[HttpGet]
[Route("cities")]
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<City>> GetCities()
{
    return Ok(Cities);
}
```


This is how I am calling the endpoint

```
getCities() {
  this.http.get<City[]>('/api/wizard/cities')
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log(result);
    this.cities = result;
  }, error => console.error('Something went wrong : ' + error));
}
```


The response I get:

The response that is needed:

```
[
  {
    "SearchCity": "Toronto",
    "AssociatedCities": "Ajax, Whitby, Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton",
    "Province": "ON",
    "Status": 1
  },
  {
    "SearchCity": "Vancouver",
    "AssociatedCities": "Vancouver, Vancouver City",
    "Province": "BC",
    "Status": 1
  }
]
```

The issue seems to be with the model class. You have defined the properties as public fields instead of properties with getters and setters. 

Change the model class to:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

This should fix the issue and return the expected response.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The issue seems to be with the `City` model class. The properties of the `City` class are defined as public fields instead of public properties. When the JSON serializer tries to serialize the `City` objects, it only serializes properties and not fields. Therefore, the response contains empty objects.

To fix this issue, you need to change the public fields to public properties in the `City` class. Here's how you can modify the `City` class:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

After making this change, the JSON serializer will be able to serialize the `City` objects properly, and you should get the expected response.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue here is that the properties in the `City` class are defined as fields instead of properties. Fields are not serialized by default in ASP.NET Core, so the response is returning empty objects.

To fix this, you need to change the fields to properties by adding getters and setters to each property in the `City` class:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

After making this change, the response should contain the expected data.
