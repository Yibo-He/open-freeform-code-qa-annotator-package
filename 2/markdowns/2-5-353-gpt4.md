As a developer, I use the default `dev` profile in my local development environment. Here is part of my `application-dev.properties` file:
```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.include=auth
```

Previously I  used Spring Boot 2.3.0.RELEASE and the `spring.profiles.include` property included `auth` profile at runtime.
But after I migrated to Spring Boot 2.4.0, I don't get the `auth` profile enabled. `spring.profiles.include` property doesn't seem to work as before.
Please tell me how I can configure my profiles so that I get the same result as before migration. (I would not like to use profile groups here)
Thanks in advance!

In Spring Boot 2.4.0, the way that the `spring.profiles.include` property works has changed. It no longer adds to the existing active profiles, but instead it replaces them. This change was made to allow more control over the active profiles in different environments.

However, you can still achieve the same result as before by using the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property. This property activates a group of properties when a specific profile is active.

Here is how you can modify your `application-dev.properties` file:

```properties
# Profiles    
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev

# Properties for 'auth' profile
auth.property1=value1
auth.property2=value2
```

In this example, the properties under the 'auth' profile will be activated when the 'dev' profile is active.

If you have a separate `application-auth.properties` file, you can rename it to `application-dev.properties` and Spring Boot will automatically include it when the 'dev' profile is active.

Remember, you need to set the active profiles by using the `spring.profiles.active` property or by using the `SpringApplication.setDefaultProfiles` method in your main class. For example:

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    SpringApplication app = new SpringApplication(MyApplication.class);
    app.setDefaultProfiles("dev");
    app.run(args);
}
```

Or in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

In Spring Boot 2.4.0, the way that the `spring.profiles.include` property works has changed. Now, profiles specified in `spring.profiles.include` are added to the already active profiles rather than being used to create a new set of active profiles.

To get the same behavior as before, you can use the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property. This property activates a group of properties when a specific profile is active.

Here is how you can use it in your `application-dev.properties` file:

```properties
# Profiles
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev

# Properties for 'dev' profile
# ...
```

And in your `application-auth.properties` file:

```properties
# Properties for 'auth' profile
# ...
```

Then, when you run your application with the `dev` profile, the properties in both `application-dev.properties` and `application-auth.properties` will be loaded.

You can activate the `dev` profile by setting the `spring.profiles.active` property in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
spring.profiles.active=dev
```

Or by using the `-Dspring.profiles.active=dev` JVM argument when you run your application:

```bash
java -jar myproject.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

In Spring Boot 2.4.0, the way that the `spring.profiles.include` property works has changed. Now, profiles specified in `spring.profiles.include` are added to the already active profiles rather than being used to create a new set of active profiles.

To get the same behavior as before, you can use the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property. This property activates a group of properties when a specific profile is active.

Here is how you can use it in your `application-dev.properties` file:

```properties
# Profiles
spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev

# Properties for 'dev' profile
# Add your properties here
```

And then in your `application.properties` file:

```properties
# Default profile
spring.profiles.active=dev

# Properties for 'auth' profile
spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth
# Add your properties here
```

This way, when the `dev` profile is active, the properties under `spring.config.activate.on-profile=dev` will be activated. Similarly, when the `auth` profile is active, the properties under `spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth` will be activated.

Remember to replace `# Add your properties here` with the actual properties that you want to use for each profile.
