It looks like you are trying to create a new database with the name "eCommerce" but there may already be a database with that name or there may be some other issue with the database server.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if there is already a database with the name "eCommerce". You can do this by expanding the "Databases" section in the left-hand panel of pgAdmin and looking for the database name.

2. If there is a database with that name, try deleting it first before creating a new one. You can do this by right-clicking on the database name and selecting "Delete/Drop".

3. If you are still unable to create a new database, try restarting the PostgreSQL server and then try creating the database again.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to check the PostgreSQL logs for any error messages that could be causing the issue.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

It looks like there may be an issue with the permissions or ownership of the database cluster. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check if you have the necessary permissions to create a new database. Make sure you are logged in as a user with the necessary privileges.

2. Check if there are any other processes or applications that may be using the database cluster. If so, try stopping them and then creating the new database.

3. Try restarting the PostgreSQL service or server and then creating the new database.

4. If none of the above steps work, you may need to check the ownership and permissions of the database cluster. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   `ls -l /var/lib/postgresql/`

   This will show you the ownership and permissions of the PostgreSQL data directory. Make sure that the owner and group are set to the PostgreSQL user and that the permissions are set to 700.

5. If you are still having issues, you may need to consult with a PostgreSQL expert or administrator for further assistance.

The error message indicates that there is already a database with the name "eCommerce" in the PostgreSQL server, and it cannot create another database with the same name. 

To resolve this issue, you can either choose a different name for the new database or delete the existing "eCommerce" database. 

If you want to delete the existing database, you can follow these steps:

1. Open pgAdmin 4 and connect to the PostgreSQL server.
2. Expand the server group and select the "Databases" node.
3. Right-click on the "eCommerce" database and select "Delete/Drop" from the context menu.
4. Confirm the deletion by clicking "Yes" in the confirmation dialog.

After deleting the existing database, you should be able to create a new database with the name "eCommerce" without any issues.
