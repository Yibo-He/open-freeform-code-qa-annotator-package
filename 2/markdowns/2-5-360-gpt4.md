I got a `data.yml` in resources folder of a following structure:
```
main:
  header:
    info: 3600L
```

I use Spring Boot version 2.4.2, I want to inject property `main.header1.info` to a field, I do this the following way:
```
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:data.yml")
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("`main.header1.info")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

But a `NumberFormatException` ocurres:
```
java.lang.NumberFormatException: For input string: "main.header1.info"
    at java.base/java.lang.NumberFormatException.forInputString(NumberFormatException.java:65) ~[na:na]
    at java.base/java.lang.Long.parseLong(Long.java:692) ~[na:na]
    ...
```

I know that `long` is not supported in `yml`, but I think its not the case. I tried other numeric types and corresponding wrapper-classes, like `Double`.
So, how to fix that?

The issue is with the property name you are trying to inject. In your `data.yml` file, the property name is `main.header.info` but in your Java code, you are trying to inject `main.header1.info`. 

The correct way to inject the property is:

```java
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:data.yml")
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("${main.header.info}")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

Also, make sure you have the `snakeyaml` dependency in your project because Spring uses it to load `.yml` or `.yaml` files. If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
    <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
    <version>1.27</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.27'
```

The issue here is not about the data type. It's about the property key you are trying to access. In your `data.yml` file, the property key is `main.header.info` but you are trying to access `main.header1.info` which does not exist. 

Also, there's a typo in your `@Value` annotation. You have an extra backtick (`) before the property key. 

Here's the corrected code:

```java
@Component
@PropertySource(value = "classpath:data.yml", factory = YamlPropertySourceFactory.class)
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("${main.header.info}")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

In addition, Spring does not natively support YAML for `@PropertySource`. You need to create a custom PropertySourceFactory to handle YAML files. Here's an example:

```java
public class YamlPropertySourceFactory implements PropertySourceFactory {

    @Override
    public PropertySource<?> createPropertySource(String name, EncodedResource resource) throws IOException {
        YamlPropertiesFactoryBean factory = new YamlPropertiesFactoryBean();
        factory.setResources(resource.getResource());

        Properties properties = factory.getObject();

        return new PropertiesPropertySource(resource.getResource().getFilename(), properties);
    }
}
```

Don't forget to import the necessary classes:

```java
import org.springframework.core.env.PropertySource;
import org.springframework.core.env.PropertiesPropertySource;
import org.springframework.core.io.support.EncodedResource;
import org.springframework.core.io.support.PropertySourceFactory;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.config.YamlPropertiesFactoryBean;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.Properties;
```

Now, Spring should be able to load properties from your YAML file and inject them into your fields.

The issue here is not with the data type but with the property name you are trying to inject. In your `data.yml` file, the property is `main.header.info` but in your code, you are trying to inject `main.header1.info` which does not exist. 

Also, you have a typo in your `@Value` annotation. You have an extra backtick (`) before the property name.

Here is the correct way to do it:

```java
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:data.yml")
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("${main.header.info}")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

This should work if you are using Spring Boot with the `spring-boot-starter-data-yaml` dependency. If you are not using this dependency, Spring Boot does not natively support YAML in `@PropertySource` annotations. In that case, you would need to use a `YamlPropertySourceLoader` to load the YAML file.
