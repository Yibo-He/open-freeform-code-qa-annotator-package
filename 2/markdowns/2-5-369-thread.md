I can't seem to find my local changes in Intellij Idea's latest version (2020.1), as you can see in the image below. What am I missing here? The "Git" tab only shows the Git log.

To see the Local Changes tab you just need to uncheck the option "Use non-modal commit interface"

Local changes can be found under "Commit" tab.

The alternative solution is: just a global search for Local Changes on IntelliJ Idea.

to bring the editor back to a close version of the previous (better) layout
view -> tool windows -> commit
on the git window that appears click the gear / settings icon
move to -> bottom left.
