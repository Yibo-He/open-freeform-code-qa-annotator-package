Getting `error fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory` while executing lambda function.
I am using windows platform to run and build code in Go.
I have done following steps to deploy go aws-lambda handler:

1. Written code in go language with VSCode in windows platform
2. Build project with : go build main.go
3. Convert main.exe to main.zip
4. Uploaded main.zip with handler name main aws-lambda fuction using aws console account
5. Created test event to test lambda function
6. Got error "fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory while executing lambda function"


```
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "github.com/aws/aws-lambda-go/lambda"
)

// Request represents the requested object
type Request struct {
    ID    int    `json:"ID"`
    Value string `json:"Value"`
}

// Response represents the Response object
type Response struct {
    Message string `json:"Message"`
    Ok      bool   `json:"Ok"`
}

// Handler represents the Handler of lambda
func Handler(request Request) (Response, error) {
    return Response{
        Message: fmt.Sprint("Process Request Id %f", request.ID),
        Ok:      true,
    }, nil
}

func main() {
    lambda.Start(Handler)
}
```

build command
```
go build main.go
```

Detail Error in AWS console
```
{
  "errorMessage": "fork/exec /var/task/main: no such file or directory",
  "errorType": "PathError"
}
```

Log Output in AWS console
```

The error message you're seeing is because the AWS Lambda environment is a Linux environment, and you're building your Go binary on a Windows machine. The binary that's produced isn't compatible with the Linux environment where the Lambda function runs.

To solve this, you need to cross-compile your Go code for a Linux environment. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go code. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
set GOOS=linux
set GOARCH=amd64
go build main.go
```

This will produce a `main` binary that's compatible with the AWS Lambda Linux environment. You can then zip this binary and upload it to AWS Lambda.

Also, make sure that the handler name is set to `main` in your AWS Lambda function configuration. This tells AWS Lambda to execute the `main` binary when the function is invoked.

Remember, AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, not a zip of the Windows executable. So, you need to zip the Linux executable and upload it to AWS Lambda.

Here's how you can zip the Linux binary:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Then, you can upload `function.zip` to AWS Lambda.

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux binary, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows binary.

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code for Linux. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables before building your Go application. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will create a Linux binary named `main`. You can then zip this binary and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip function.zip main
```

Also, make sure your handler is set to `main` in your AWS Lambda function configuration.

This should resolve the issue you're facing.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error you're encountering is due to the fact that AWS Lambda expects a Linux executable, but you're building your Go application on a Windows machine, which produces a Windows executable. 

To solve this issue, you need to cross-compile your Go code to a Linux binary before deploying it to AWS Lambda. You can do this by setting the `GOOS` and `GOARCH` environment variables when building your Go application. 

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
SET GOOS=linux
SET GOARCH=amd64
go build -o main main.go
```

This will produce a Linux binary named `main`. You can then zip this binary and upload it to AWS Lambda:

```bash
zip deployment.zip main
```

Now, you can upload `deployment.zip` to AWS Lambda. Your handler should be named `main` (without any extension). 

Remember, AWS Lambda runs your code in a Linux-based environment, so you need to ensure your binary is compatible with it.
