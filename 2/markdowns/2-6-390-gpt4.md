I have a simple web api project, which looks like this:

```
[Authorize]
        [Route("Get")]
        public ActionResult<string> SayHello()
        {
            return "Hello World";
        }
```


I am trying to test it with Postman.  By following the steps here: [https://kevinchalet.com/2016/07/13/creating-your-own-openid-connect-server-with-asos-testing-your-authorization-server-with-postman/](https://kevinchalet.com/2016/07/13/creating-your-own-openid-connect-server-with-asos-testing-your-authorization-server-with-postman/)

1) Send the request below and receive a token as expected:

2) Attempt to send another request with the authorization token as shown below:

Why do I get a 401 (unauthorized) error? The WWW-Authenticate response header says: Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="The issuer is invalid".  I am using .Net Core 3.1.  I have commented out the sensitive information in the screenshots.

The web api works as expected when accessed from an MVC application.

Here is the startup code:

```
services.AddAuthentication("Bearer")
                .AddIdentityServerAuthentication(options =>
                {
                    options.Authority = identityUrl; //identityurl is a config item
                    options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
                    options.ApiName = apiName;

                });
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message "The issuer is invalid" indicates that the issuer of the token is not trusted by your API. This usually happens when the issuer URL in the token does not match the authority URL configured in your API.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure the `identityUrl` configured in your API matches the issuer URL in the token. You can decode your token using a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) and check the `iss` claim.

2. If you're using different environments (like local, staging, production), ensure that the correct `identityUrl` is used for each environment.

3. If you're using IdentityServer4, make sure the API resource name (`apiName`) matches the one configured in IdentityServer.

4. If you're testing locally, ensure that your IdentityServer and API are running on the correct ports and that those ports are correctly configured in your `identityUrl`.

5. Make sure the token is not expired.

6. Ensure that the token is passed correctly in the Authorization header in the format `Bearer your_token_here`.

If everything seems correct and you're still facing the issue, you might want to enable detailed logging in your API to get more information about why the token validation is failing.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message "The issuer is invalid" suggests that the issuer of the token is not recognized or trusted by your API. This typically happens when the `Authority` option in your API configuration does not match the issuer of the token.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the issuer in the token**: You can decode your JWT token using online tools like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). Check the `iss` claim in the token. It should match the `Authority` you have set in your API configuration.

2. **Check the Authority configuration**: Make sure the `Authority` option in your API configuration is set correctly. It should be the URL of the Identity Server that issued the token. 

3. **Check the token validation settings**: If you have any custom token validation settings in your Identity Server or API, make sure they are correct. For example, if you have set the `ValidateIssuer` option to `false`, your API will not validate the issuer of the token, which can lead to this error.

4. **Check the API name**: The `ApiName` option in your API configuration should match the `aud` (audience) claim in the token.

5. **Check the HTTPS settings**: If your Identity Server is running on HTTPS and you have set `RequireHttpsMetadata` to `false`, this can cause issues. Try setting `RequireHttpsMetadata` to `true` if your Identity Server is using HTTPS.

6. **Check the token expiration**: Make sure the token has not expired. You can check the `exp` claim in the token.

If none of these suggestions help, please provide more details about your Identity Server configuration and the token you are using.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message "The issuer is invalid" suggests that the token's issuer (the "iss" claim) doesn't match the expected issuer. The expected issuer is usually the URL of the Identity Server that issued the token.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the issuer in the token**: You can decode your JWT token using a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). Check the "iss" claim in the payload. It should match the `identityUrl` you have in your configuration.

2. **Check the `identityUrl` configuration**: Make sure that the `identityUrl` in your configuration matches the issuer URL of your Identity Server. This should be the base URL of your Identity Server, without any paths or query strings.

3. **Check the token's signature**: If the issuer seems to be correct, the problem might be with the token's signature. The Identity Server uses a signing key to sign the tokens, and the API needs the same key to validate the tokens. Make sure that the API has the correct signing key.

4. **Check the `ApiName` configuration**: The `ApiName` in your configuration should match one of the audiences ("aud" claim) in the token. You can also check this in the decoded token.

5. **Check the token's lifetime**: Make sure that the token hasn't expired. The "exp" claim in the token contains the expiration time as a Unix timestamp.

If everything seems to be correct and you're still getting the error, you might want to enable more detailed logging in IdentityServer and in your API to get more information about why the token validation fails.
