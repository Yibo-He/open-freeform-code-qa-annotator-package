I am implementing the petstore API with openAPI in a (gradle) spring boot project. I generate a server with the openapi generator plugin and implement a simple request:
```
@Service
@RestController
public class PetApiController implements PetApi {

    @Override
    public ResponseEntity<Pet> getPetById(Long petId) {
        Pet p = new Pet();
        p.setId(0L);
        p.setName("fido");
        p.setPhotoUrls(new ArrayList<String>());
        p.setStatus(StatusEnum.AVAILABLE);
        p.setTags(new ArrayList<Tag>());
        Category c = new Category();
        c.setId(3L);
        c.setName("dummy category");
        p.setCategory(c);
        
        ResponseEntity<Pet> r = new ResponseEntity<Pet>(p, HttpStatus.OK);
        
        return r;
    }
}
```

The swagger-ui that I generate offers both xml and json queries for a request, but xml doesn't seem to work:
```
$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/pet/1" -H  "accept: application/xml"; echo ""

$ curl -X GET "http://localhost:8080/pet/1" -H  "accept: application/json"; echo ""
{"id":0,"name":"fido","category":{"id":3,"name":"dummy category"},"photoUrls":[],"tags":[],"status":"available"}
```

I even get an error message:
```
2020-09-10 09:04:34.213  WARN 23958 --- [nio-8080-exec-1] .w.s.m.s.DefaultHandlerExceptionResolver : Resolved [org.springframework.http.converter.HttpMessageNotWritableException: No converter for [class com.petstore.server.model.Pet] with preset Content-Type 'null']
```

However I cannot catch this exception and print the whole context, it only happens after `return r`
There is already a question with my exact error message:
[Springboot HttpMessageNotWritableException: No converter for [...] with preset Content-Type 'null']](https://stackoverflow.com/q/60502811/3014199) But I still think my context is different since I generate my POJOs so I have no controll over them and I shouldn't have this problem in the first place since the plugin should generate everything fittingly.

It seems like the issue is with the content type of the response. The error message suggests that there is no converter for the `Pet` class with the preset content type of `null`. 

You can try specifying the content type of the response explicitly in the `@RequestMapping` annotation, like this:

```
@RequestMapping(value = "/pet/{petId}", produces = {"application/json", "application/xml"})
```

This should tell Spring to use the appropriate converter for the specified content types.

If that doesn't work, you can try adding a message converter explicitly to your Spring configuration. For example, if you want to support XML responses, you can add the following to your `WebMvcConfigurer` implementation:

```
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureMessageConverters(List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> converters) {
        converters.add(new MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter());
    }
}
```

This will add a converter that can convert `Pet` objects to XML.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems that the issue is related to the lack of a proper message converter for XML in your Spring Boot application. By default, Spring Boot includes the Jackson message converter for JSON, but not for XML.

To fix this issue, you can add the necessary dependencies to your Gradle build file:
```
dependencies {
    // ...
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.module:jackson-module-jaxb-annotations'
}
```

Then, you can configure Spring Boot to use the Jackson XML message converter by adding the following bean to your application configuration:
```
@Bean
public MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter mappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter() {
    ObjectMapper mapper = new XmlMapper();
    return new MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter(mapper);
}
```

This should enable your Spring Boot application to properly handle XML requests and responses.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the issue is with the content type being set to null. You can try explicitly setting the content type for the response entity to "application/xml" to see if that resolves the issue. 

```
ResponseEntity<Pet> r = ResponseEntity.ok()
                .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_XML)
                .body(p);
```

If that doesn't work, you can also try adding the Jackson XML dependency to your project and configuring it to handle XML serialization/deserialization. 

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat</groupId>
    <artifactId>jackson-dataformat-xml</artifactId>
    <version>${jackson.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the following configuration to your application.properties file:

```
spring.jackson.serialization.INDENT_OUTPUT=true
spring.jackson.mapper.defaultUseWrapper=false
spring.jackson.xml.enabled=true
```

This should enable Jackson to handle XML serialization/deserialization for your response entities.
