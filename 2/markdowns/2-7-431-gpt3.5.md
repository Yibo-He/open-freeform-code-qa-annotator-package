how can I increase the laravel 8  `dd()` limitations? I have lots of nested relationship and I cant view most of them due to many data. For example this
```
#relations: array:4 [▼
    "activecourses" => Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#1346 ▼
      #items: array:3 [▼
        0 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1353 ▶}
        1 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1354 ▼
          #guarded: []
          #connection: "mysql"
          #table: "studentcourses"
          #primaryKey: "id"
          #keyType: "int"
          +incrementing: true
          #with: []
          #withCount: []
          +preventsLazyLoading: false
          #perPage: 15
          +exists: true
          +wasRecentlyCreated: false
          #escapeWhenCastingToString: false
          #attributes: array:22 [ …22]
          #original: array:22 [ …22]
          #changes: []
          #casts: []
          #classCastCache: []
          #attributeCastCache: []
          #dates: []
          #dateFormat: null
          #appends: []
          #dispatchesEvents: []
          #observables: []
          #relations: array:1 [ …1]
          #touches: []
          +timestamps: true
          #hidden: []
          #visible: []
          #fillable: []
        }
        2 => App\Models\Studentcourse {#1355 ▶}
      ]
      #escapeWhenCastingToString: false
    }
```

I found this link [Laravel dd function limitations](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39011241/laravel-dd-function-limitations) but I think its outdated since the new dd function for laravel 8 is
this is from vendor folder.
```
use Symfony\Component\VarDumper\VarDumper;

if (!function_exists('dump')) {
    /**
     * @author Nicolas Grekas <p@tchwork.com>
     */
    function dump($var, ...$moreVars)
    {
        VarDumper::dump($var);

        foreach ($moreVars as $v) {
            VarDumper::dump($v);
        }

        if (1 < func_num_args()) {
            return func_get_args();
        }

        return $var;
    }
}

if (!function_exists('dd')) {
    /**
     * @return never
     */
    function dd(...$vars)
    {
        if (!in_array(\PHP_SAPI, ['cli', 'phpdbg'], true) && !headers_sent()) {
            header('HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error');
        }

        foreach ($vars as $v) {
            VarDumper::dump($v);
        }

        exit(1);
    }
}
```

Tried adding this lines before `dd()` but doesnt work
```
ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_depth', 100);
   ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_children', 2000);
   ini_set('xdebug.var_display_max_data', 2000);
```

Is there any way or alternative in viewing nested data? I dont want to use `var_dump` or `print_r` since the browser becomes slow when there are lots of data. Thanks in advance.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can try using the `dump()` function instead of `dd()`. The `dump()` function will output the data to the browser console instead of stopping the execution of the script like `dd()` does. This way, you can view the data in the console and expand/collapse the nested relationships as needed.

To use `dump()`, simply replace `dd()` with `dump()` in your code. For example:

```
dump($user->with('posts.comments')->get());
```

This will output the data to the browser console, where you can expand/collapse the nested relationships as needed.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party package like Laravel Debugbar or Clockwork to view the data in a more organized and user-friendly way. These packages provide a toolbar that displays information about the current request, including database queries, HTTP requests, and more. They also allow you to view the data in a structured way, with the ability to expand/collapse nested relationships.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()` to view the nested data. The `dump()` function will output the data to the browser console instead of stopping the script execution like `dd()` does. This way, you can view the data without overwhelming the browser.

To use the `dump()` function, replace `dd()` with `dump()` in your code. For example:

```
dump($myNestedData);
```

You can also use the `dump()` function to output multiple variables at once:

```
dump($var1, $var2, $var3);
```

Additionally, you can customize the output of the `dump()` function by passing options as the second argument. For example:

```
dump($myNestedData, ['maxDepth' => 10, 'maxItemsPerDepth' => 100]);
```

This will limit the maximum depth of nested data to 10 and the maximum number of items per depth to 100. You can adjust these values to suit your needs.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()` to view the nested data. The `dump()` function is similar to `dd()` but it does not stop the execution of the script. This means that you can continue to view the data in your browser without having to reload the page.

To increase the `dump()` function limitations, you can add the following lines of code to your `config/app.php` file:

```
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Illuminate\Debug\DumperServiceProvider::class,
],

'debug' => [
    // ...
    'max_items' => 2500,
    'max_string_length' => 10000,
],
```

This will increase the maximum number of items and the maximum string length that can be displayed by the `dump()` function.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party package like Laravel Debugbar or Clockwork to view the nested data in a more organized and user-friendly way. These packages provide a toolbar that displays information about the current request, including the database queries, HTTP requests, and response data.
