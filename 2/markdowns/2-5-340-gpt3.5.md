The program that automatically grades my code is docking me "style-points" for an else-if that doesn't execute any code. It says that it may cause an error, but I don't think it could.
I'm not sure how to change it so that it still works but doesn't break the rule. Why is doing this bad form? I think any other way I write it will be harder for a reader to understand. How should it be written instead?
```
if (! seesWater(LEFT))
{
    turn(LEFT);
}
else if (! seesWater(AHEAD));
else if (! seesWater(RIGHT))
{
    turn(RIGHT);
}
else
{
    turn180();
}
```

The reason the else-if is there but does nothing is because of the priority in which I want the code to act:
`if (! seesWater(AHEAD))`, then I don't want the rest of the conditions to run at all because they don't matter.

It's good that you're thinking about the readability of your code, but it's also important to follow best practices to ensure that your code is maintainable and free of potential errors.

In this case, the empty else-if statement is considered bad form because it can be confusing to other developers who may be reading your code. They may wonder why the statement is there if it doesn't do anything, and it could lead to mistakes or misunderstandings in the future.

To avoid this issue, you can simply remove the empty else-if statement and combine the conditions of the first two if statements like this:

```
if (! seesWater(LEFT) || ! seesWater(AHEAD))
{
    if (! seesWater(LEFT))
    {
        turn(LEFT);
    }
    else
    {
        turn(RIGHT);
    }
}
else
{
    turn180();
}
```

This way, if the condition `! seesWater(AHEAD)` is true, the code will skip the second if statement and move on to the else block. This achieves the same result as your original code, but without the empty else-if statement.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

It's good that you're thinking about the readability of your code, but in this case, the empty else-if statement is actually unnecessary and can be removed without affecting the functionality of your code. 

The reason why it's considered bad form is that it can be confusing for other programmers who may read your code in the future. They may assume that there is some code that should be executed in that else-if statement, and spend time trying to figure out what it is. Additionally, if you or someone else were to modify the code later on, it could be easy to accidentally introduce a bug by adding code to that empty else-if statement.

To achieve the same functionality without the empty else-if statement, you can simply combine the first two conditions into a single if statement using the logical AND operator (`&&`). Here's what the updated code would look like:

```
if (!seesWater(LEFT) && !seesWater(AHEAD))
{
    // no water to the left or ahead, so turn left
    turn(LEFT);
}
else if (!seesWater(RIGHT))
{
    // water to the left or ahead, but not to the right, so turn right
    turn(RIGHT);
}
else
{
    // water on all sides, so turn around
    turn180();
}
```

This code achieves the same functionality as your original code, but without the unnecessary else-if statement.

It's good that you're thinking about the readability of your code, but it's also important to follow best practices to avoid potential errors and make your code more maintainable in the long run.

In this case, the problem with the empty `else if` statement is that it creates a dangling `if` statement. This means that the `else` block is not associated with any `if` statement, which can lead to confusion and errors if you or someone else modifies the code later on.

To avoid this issue, you can simply remove the empty `else if` statement and combine the conditions of the first two `if` statements using the logical AND operator (`&&`). Here's what the updated code would look like:

```
if (!seesWater(LEFT) && !seesWater(AHEAD)) {
    turn(LEFT);
} else if (!seesWater(RIGHT)) {
    turn(RIGHT);
} else {
    turn180();
}
```

This way, the `else` block is associated with the second `if` statement, and the code is more concise and easier to read.
