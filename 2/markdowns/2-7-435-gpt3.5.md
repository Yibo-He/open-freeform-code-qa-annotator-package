Im fairly new to docker and so im trying to learn more about it using a laravel project, im following this tutorial:
[https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-laravel-nginx-and-mysql-with-docker-compose](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-laravel-nginx-and-mysql-with-docker-compose)
Ive adjusted the Dockerfile a bit from what the tutorial has but even the tutorial file causes the same result.
```
FROM php:7.3-fpm

# Copy composer.lock and composer.json
COPY composer.lock composer.json /var/www/
# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client \
    

RUN npm install -g npm

# Clear cache
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


# Install extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql

# Install composer
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

# Add user for laravel application
RUN groupadd -g 1000 www
RUN useradd -u 1000 -ms /bin/bash -g www www

# Copy existing application directory contents
COPY . /var/www

# Copy existing application directory permissions
COPY --chown=www:www . /var/www

# Change current user to www
USER www
# Set working directory
WORKDIR /var/www
# Expose port 9000 and start php-fpm server
EXPOSE 9000

CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

But i keep getting the following error when i run `docker-compose up -d`:
```
E: Package 'mysql-client' has no installation candidate
ERROR: Service 'app' failed to build: The command '/bin/sh -c curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - &&     apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client     nodejs     build-essential     vim     git     curl' returned a non-zero code: 100
```

Am i missing something?
I expected this to work since i am running `apt-get update` before installing `mysql-client`.
Thanks.

It seems like the `mysql-client` package is not available in the repository that your Dockerfile is using. You can try using a different repository or installing the package from a different source.

One solution could be to use the `mariadb-client` package instead of `mysql-client`. You can replace the following line in your Dockerfile:

```
apt-get install -y mysql-client \
```

with:

```
apt-get install -y mariadb-client \
```

This should install the necessary package and resolve the error you are seeing.

Alternatively, you can try updating your repository by adding the following line before the `apt-get update` command:

```
RUN echo "deb http://deb.debian.org/debian buster main" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
```

This will add the Debian Buster repository to your sources list, which should include the `mysql-client` package.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the `mysql-client` package is not available in the repository that you are using. You can try changing the package name to `default-mysql-client` and see if it works. 

Replace this line:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client \
```

With this line:
```
apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client \
```

Also, make sure that you have added the `nodejs` package to the installation command as well. 

Replace this line:
```
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y mysql-client \
```

With this line:
```
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client nodejs \
```

After making these changes, try building the Docker image again and see if it works.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that the package `mysql-client` cannot be installed because it has no installation candidate. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package is not available in the repository that you are using. You can try updating the repository or using a different one.

2. The package has been deprecated or replaced by a different package. In this case, you can try installing the replacement package instead.

To fix the issue, you can try replacing `mysql-client` with `default-mysql-client` in your Dockerfile and see if that works. Here's the updated Dockerfile:

```
FROM php:7.3-fpm

# Copy composer.lock and composer.json
COPY composer.lock composer.json /var/www/
# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client \
    

RUN npm install -g npm

# Clear cache
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*


# Install extensions
RUN docker-php-ext-install pdo pdo_mysql

# Install composer
RUN curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php -- --install-dir=/usr/local/bin --filename=composer

# Add user for laravel application
RUN groupadd -g 1000 www
RUN useradd -u 1000 -ms /bin/bash -g www www

# Copy existing application directory contents
COPY . /var/www

# Copy existing application directory permissions
COPY --chown=www:www . /var/www

# Change current user to www
USER www
# Set working directory
WORKDIR /var/www
# Expose port 9000 and start php-fpm server
EXPOSE 9000

CMD ["php-fpm"]
```

This should install the default MySQL client instead of the `mysql-client` package.
