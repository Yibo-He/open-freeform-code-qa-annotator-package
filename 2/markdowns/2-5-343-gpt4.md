A food fest is organised at the JLN stadium. The stalls from different states and cities have been set up. To make the fest more interesting, multiple games have been arranged which can be played by the people to win the food vouchers.One such game to win the food vouchers is described below:
There are N number of boxes arranged in a single queue. Each box has an integer I written on it. From the given queue, the participant has to select two contiguous subsequences A and B of the same size. The selected subsequences should be such that the summation of the product of the boxes should be maximum. The product is not calculated normally though. To make the game interesting, the first box of subsequence A is to be multiplied by the last box of subsequence B. The second box of subsequence A is to be multiplied by the second last box of subsequence B and so on. All the products thus obtained are then added together.
If the participant is able to find the correct such maximum summation, he/she will win the game and will be awarded the food voucher of the same value.
Note: The subsequences A and B should be disjoint.
Example:
Number of boxes, N = 8
The order of the boxes is provided below:

Subsequence A

Subsequence B

The product of the subsequences will be calculated as below:
P1 = 9 * 8 = 72
P2 = 2 * 7 = 14
P3 = 3 * 6 = 18
Summation, S = P1 + P2 + P3 = 72 + 14 + 18 = 104
This is the maximum summation possible as per the requirement for the given N boxes.
Tamanna is also in the fest and wants to play this game. She needs help in winning the game and is asking for your help. Can you help her in winning the food vouchers?
Input Format
The first line of input consists of the number of boxes, N.
The second line of input consists of N space-separated integers.
Constraints
1< N <=3000
-10^6 <= I <=10^6
Output Format

Your code is not considering all possible pairs of subsequences. It is only considering pairs of subsequences that are adjacent to each other. However, the problem statement does not require the subsequences to be adjacent. They only need to be disjoint. 

Here is a Python solution that considers all possible pairs of subsequences. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for all possible pairs of subsequences.

```python
def max_sum_product(arr, n):
    prefix = [0]*(n+1)
    suffix = [0]*(n+1)
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]
        dp[i][i] = max(dp[i-1][i], arr[i-1])
        
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + arr[i-1]
        dp[i][i] = max(dp[i][i+1], arr[i-1])
        
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(1, n-length+2):
            j = i+length-1
            dp[i][j] = max(prefix[j]-prefix[i-1], suffix[i]-suffix[j+1])
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
                
    return dp[1][n]

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_sum_product(arr, n))
```

This solution calculates the prefix and suffix sums of the array. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for all possible pairs of subsequences. The dp[i][j] stores the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for the subsequence from i to j. The solution iterates over all possible lengths of subsequences and for each length, it iterates over all possible starting points of the subsequence. For each subsequence, it calculates the maximum summation of the product of the boxes by considering all possible pairs of subsequences within the current subsequence. The final answer is stored in dp[1][n].

The problem with your code is that it assumes that the two subsequences will always be at the end of the array. This is not necessarily true. The subsequences could be anywhere in the array.

Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It iterates through all possible pairs of subsequences and keeps track of the maximum sum of products. It also handles the case where the numbers can be negative.

```python
def max_sum_of_products(n, arr):
    prefix = [0]*(n+1)
    suffix = [0]*(n+1)
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]
        dp[i][i] = max(dp[i-1][i-1], arr[i-1]*arr[i-1])
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + arr[i-1]
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(1, n-length+2):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j-1] + arr[i-1]*arr[j-1])
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i+1][j] + arr[i-1]*(prefix[i+length-2]-prefix[i]))
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + arr[j-1]*(suffix[j-length+2]-suffix[j+1]))
    return dp[1][n]

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_sum_of_products(n, arr))
```

This solution works by first calculating the prefix and suffix sums of the array. Then it iterates through all possible pairs of subsequences and calculates the sum of products for each pair. It keeps track of the maximum sum of products and returns it at the end.

Your code is not handling the problem correctly. The problem is asking for two contiguous subsequences A and B of the same size with maximum summation of the product of the boxes. But your code is not ensuring that the subsequences are contiguous and of the same size. 

Here is a Python solution that uses dynamic programming to solve the problem:

```python
def max_sum_product(arr, n):
    prefix = [0]*(n+1)
    suffix = [0]*(n+1)
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    for i in range(n):
        prefix[i+1] = prefix[i] + arr[i]
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + arr[i]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i+1, n+1):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] + (prefix[j]-prefix[i])*(suffix[n-j+i]-suffix[n-i]))
    return dp[n][n]

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_sum_product(arr, n))
```

This code first calculates the prefix and suffix sum of the array. Then it uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum summation of the product of the boxes. For each pair of indices i and j, it considers four possibilities: not including i or j, not including i, not including j, and including both i and j. The maximum of these four possibilities is stored in dp[i][j]. Finally, it returns dp[n][n], which is the maximum summation of the product of the boxes.
