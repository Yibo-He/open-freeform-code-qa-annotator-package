Helllo I already use this pattern of Mediator CQRS with Pipeline Behavior for a while, but just now i'm facing a issue where the generic implementation of TResponse and TRequest are not enough. So i'm trying to understand if having two separate pipelines for two very specific request is a bad practice or a bad ideia.
So the main idea is, having a PipelineBehavior<RequestOne, ResponseOne> to do a specific logic for the requestOne, and another PipelineBehavior<RequestTwo, ResponseTwo> to do another logic that doesn't apply to request one.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice or idea. In fact, it can be a good way to keep your code organized and maintainable. 

However, it's important to consider the overall architecture of your application and ensure that you're not creating unnecessary complexity. If the two requests have completely different logic and don't share any common behavior, then separate pipelines may be appropriate. 

On the other hand, if there is some shared behavior between the two requests, it may be better to create a more generic pipeline that can handle both requests. This can help reduce duplication and make your code more modular.

Ultimately, the decision of whether to use separate pipelines or a more generic approach will depend on the specific requirements of your application and the trade-offs between complexity and maintainability.

Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice or idea. In fact, it can be a good way to keep your code organized and maintainable. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design of your application and whether having separate pipelines will lead to duplication of code or unnecessary complexity. 

If the logic for RequestOne and RequestTwo is significantly different and cannot be easily combined into a single pipeline, then having separate pipelines may be the best approach. 

Just make sure that you are following good coding practices, such as keeping your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Having two separate pipelines for two specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice or a bad idea. In fact, it can be a good approach if the two requests have very different requirements and logic. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design of your application and ensure that you're not creating unnecessary complexity. If the two requests have some common logic or requirements, it might be better to have a single pipeline with conditional logic to handle each request differently.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
