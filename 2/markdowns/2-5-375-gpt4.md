I use `trim()` method in order to trim leading and trailing whitespaces in some of the string field.
```
siteRequest.getName().trim();
```

However, when string field is null, it throws exception as expected. I can check the values before trimming as shown below:
```
siteRequest.getName() ? siteRequest.getName() : siteRequest.getName().trim();
```

However, if it is possible I would prefer a cleaner way so that several people had already faced this problem. Any suggestion with a smarter approach?

You can use Optional in Java 8 and above to handle null values in a cleaner way. Here's how you can do it:

```java
Optional.ofNullable(siteRequest.getName()).map(String::trim).orElse(null);
```

This code will return the trimmed string if `siteRequest.getName()` is not null, and null otherwise.

The `Optional.ofNullable()` method creates an Optional object that may or may not contain a non-null value. The `map()` method applies the `String::trim` function to the value if it is present, and the `orElse()` method returns the result if it is present and null otherwise. This approach avoids the need for explicit null checks.

You can use Optional in Java 8 and above to handle this situation in a cleaner way. Here's how you can do it:

```java
Optional.ofNullable(siteRequest.getName()).map(String::trim).orElse(null);
```

This line of code will check if `siteRequest.getName()` is null. If it is not null, it will trim the string, otherwise it will return null. This way, you avoid the NullPointerException that you would get if you directly call `trim()` on a null value.
