I've created a new Java project in IntelliJ with Gradle that uses Java 17. When running my app it has the error `Cause: error: invalid source release: 17`.

I've installed `openjdk-17` through `IntelliJ` and set it as my `Project SDK`.
The `Project language level` has been set to `17 - Sealed types, always-strict floating-point semantics`.

In `Modules -> Sources` I've set the `Language level` to `Project default (17 - Sealed types, always strict floating-point semantics)`.

In `Modules -> Dependencies` I've set the `Module SDK` to `Project SDK openjdk-17`.

In `Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler -> Java Compiler` I've set the `Project bytecode version` to `17`.

```
plugins {
    id 'org.springframework.boot' version '2.5.6'
    id 'io.spring.dependency-management' version '1.0.11.RELEASE'
    id 'java'
}

group = 'com.app'
version = '0.0.1-SNAPSHOT'
sourceCompatibility = '17'

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web'
    implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-websocket'
    testImplementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-test'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-core:2.13.0'
    implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.13.0'
}

test {
    useJUnitPlatform()
}
```

I've looked at all of the answers [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46280859/intellij-idea-error-java-invalid-source-release-1-9) but I can't seem to fix this. I must be missing something but I can't find it. I've not had any problems using Java 8 or 11.
How do I resolve this?

The error you're encountering is because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. Even though you've set the Java version in IntelliJ IDEA, Gradle might still be using a different version. 

You can specify the Java version for Gradle in a couple of ways:

1. **Specify the Java version in the `gradle.properties` file.** Create or modify the `gradle.properties` file in the root directory of your project (or in your Gradle home directory) and add the following line:

    ```
    org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
    ```

    Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

2. **Specify the Java version in the `build.gradle` file.** You can specify the Java version directly in your `build.gradle` file:

    ```groovy
    java {
        toolchain {
            languageVersion = JavaLanguageVersion.of(17)
        }
    }
    ```

    This will tell Gradle to use the Java 17 toolchain.

3. **Use the Gradle Wrapper.** The Gradle Wrapper is a script that can automatically download and use the correct Gradle version for your project. You can specify the Java version for the Gradle Wrapper in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

    ```
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.3-bin.zip
    ```

    Gradle 7.3 and later versions support Java 17.

After making these changes, try running your project again. If you're still encountering issues, make sure that your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the correct Java version.

The error you're seeing is likely because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. Even though you've set the Java version in IntelliJ, Gradle might still be using a different version. 

You can specify the Java version for Gradle in a couple of ways:

1. **gradle.properties file**: You can specify the Java version in a `gradle.properties` file in your project directory. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it. Add the following lines to the file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

2. **GRADLE_OPTS environment variable**: You can set the `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variable to specify the Java version. Add the following line to your shell profile file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`):

```bash
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17"
```

Again, replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

After setting the Java version for Gradle, try running your app again. It should now use the correct Java version.

The error message `Cause: error: invalid source release: 17` indicates that Gradle is trying to compile your code with a version of Java that doesn't support Java 17. 

The `sourceCompatibility` in your `build.gradle` file is set to '17', which means you want to compile your code with Java 17. However, it seems that Gradle itself is not running with Java 17.

To fix this, you need to ensure that Gradle is using Java 17. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Gradle settings in IntelliJ IDEA. You can find it under `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle`.

2. Under the `Gradle JVM` option, select your `17` version of Java. If it's not listed, you can add it by clicking on the `...` button and pointing it to your Java 17 installation directory.

3. Click `OK` to save the settings.

4. Try to build your project again.

If you're running Gradle from the command line, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 17 installation directory. You can do this in your terminal:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/java17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/java17` with the actual path to your Java 17 installation directory. After setting `JAVA_HOME`, you can run your Gradle build again.
