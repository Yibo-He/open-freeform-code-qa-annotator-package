I want to store the current date time in MySQL using the following Laravel function. Actually, I stored a static date. Instead of this, how can I store the current date time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the database?
```
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => '2017-04-27 10:29:59', "updated_at" => '2017-04-27 10:29:59');
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

In Laravel, you can use the `now()` function to get the current date and time. Here is how you can modify your function to store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format required by MySQL. 

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have `$timestamps = true;` in your model (which is the default), Laravel will automatically handle the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you. You don't need to manually set these fields.

In Laravel, you can use the `now()` function to get the current date and time. Here's how you can modify your function to store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields:

```php
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

This will store the current date and time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the database.

However, if you're using Laravel's Eloquent ORM and have the `timestamps` property set to `true` in your model (which is the default), Laravel will automatically handle the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields for you. You won't need to manually set these fields when you create or update a model instance.

    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

The `now()` function will return the current date and time in the format required by MySQL.

However, if you are using Laravel's Eloquent ORM to manage your database, you don't need to manually set the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Laravel will automatically set these fields for you when you create or update a model.
