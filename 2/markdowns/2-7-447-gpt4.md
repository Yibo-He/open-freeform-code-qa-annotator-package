I submitting the arrays value from the html and recieving them into the Laravel controller, the problem is I have multiple arrays with seprate attributes arrays. I want to store the info into the database as a collection. Let me explain with example
HTML CODE
```
<input type="text" name="tw_name[]" placeholder="name" value="{{ old('tw_name') }}">
<input type="text" name="tw_price[]"  placeholder="price" value="{{ old('tw_price') }}">
```

Now I am receving the tw_name and tw_prices arrays in the controller, but I want to store them into the database using model like below
```
Bet::create([
  'name' => 'first_name',
  'price' => '10',
]);

Bet::create([
  'name' => 'second_name',
  'price' => '20',
]);
```

User can add 12 forms, so we can't say that user can submit 3 form or 5 form or 10. So we need to handle the same form and save them into database.
if the user will submit 3 form it we will recive 3 arrays in controller
```
Bet::create([
  'name' => 'first_name',
  'price' => '10',
]);

Bet::create([
  'name' => 'second_name',
  'price' => '20',
]);
Bet::create([
  'name' => 'thir_name',
  'price' => '30',
]);
```

How can I save them into database, Thank you

You can use a loop to iterate over the arrays and create the Bet instances. Here's how you can do it:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $names = $request->input('tw_name');
    $prices = $request->input('tw_price');

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($names); $i++) {
        Bet::create([
            'name' => $names[$i],
            'price' => $prices[$i],
        ]);
    }

    // redirect or return response
}
```

This code assumes that the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays have the same length. It gets the arrays from the request, then loops over them. For each iteration, it creates a new Bet with the name and price from the current index of the arrays.

Please make sure that the 'name' and 'price' fields are fillable in your Bet model:

```php
protected $fillable = ['name', 'price'];
```

This is to prevent mass assignment exceptions.

You can handle this by looping through the arrays in your controller. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $names = $request->get('tw_name');
    $prices = $request->get('tw_price');

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($names); $i++) {
        Bet::create([
            'name' => $names[$i],
            'price' => $prices[$i],
        ]);
    }

    return back()->with('success', 'Bets created successfully');
}
```

In this example, we're getting the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays from the request, then looping through them and creating a new Bet for each pair of name and price. The count() function is used to get the number of elements in the 'tw_name' array, which we're assuming is the same as the number of elements in the 'tw_price' array.

Please note that this code doesn't handle validation or error checking. You should add appropriate validation and error checking to ensure that the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays have the same number of elements and that each name and price is valid before creating the Bet objects.

You can use a loop to iterate over the arrays and create a new Bet for each pair of name and price. Here's an example of how you can do this in your Laravel controller:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $names = $request->get('tw_name');
    $prices = $request->get('tw_price');

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($names); $i++) {
        Bet::create([
            'name' => $names[$i],
            'price' => $prices[$i],
        ]);
    }

    // redirect or return response
}
```

In this code, we're getting the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays from the request. Then we're looping over these arrays and for each iteration, we're creating a new Bet with the corresponding name and price.

Please note that this code assumes that the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays have the same length. If they don't, this could result in an error. You might want to add some error checking to handle this case.
