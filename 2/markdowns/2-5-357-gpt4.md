I have seen many people using `@Autowired` annotation in constructor to inject dependencies like as shown below
```
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;
 
 @Autowired
 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```

as per my knowledge nowadays Spring is so advanced and the Spring constructor/setter DI works even without `@Autowired` like as shown below
```
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;

 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```

Like to know is there any reason why people annotate constructor with `@Autowired` annotation to inject dependencies.
Can someone please help me on this

Yes, you are correct. Starting from Spring 4.3, if a class, which is annotated with @Component or its derivatives like @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc., contains a single constructor, the @Autowired annotation on that constructor is no longer necessary and the IoC container will use that constructor for autowiring.

The reason why you might still see @Autowired on constructors could be due to several reasons:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: If the codebase is old and was written when Spring version was less than 4.3, then @Autowired was necessary for constructor injection. It might not have been updated to reflect the newer capabilities.

2. **Explicitness**: Some developers prefer to be explicit about their intentions. Using @Autowired makes it clear that the constructor is being used for autowiring, which can make the code easier to understand for people who are not familiar with the newer features of Spring.

3. **Multiple Constructors**: If a class has more than one constructor, Spring won't be able to guess which one to use, so @Autowired is still necessary in this case to specify which constructor should be used for autowiring.

4. **Education and Tutorials**: Many tutorials and educational resources still use @Autowired in their examples for simplicity and clarity. This can lead to newer developers using it out of habit or because they're following these resources.

In general, if you're using Spring 4.3 or later and your class has only one constructor, you can safely omit the @Autowired annotation.

Yes, you are correct. Since Spring 4.3, if a class, which is annotated with @Component or its derivatives like @Service, @Repository, @Controller, etc., contains a single constructor, the @Autowired annotation on that constructor is no longer necessary and the IoC container will use that constructor for autowiring.

However, if the class has more than one constructor, then we need to use @Autowired on the constructor which we want to use for autowiring.

So, why do people still use @Autowired on constructors?

1. **Backward Compatibility**: If your codebase needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring, you need to use @Autowired.

2. **Explicitness**: Using @Autowired makes it clear that Spring is managing this dependency. It can make the code easier to understand for someone who is not familiar with the newer features of Spring.

3. **Multiple Constructors**: If your class has more than one constructor and you want Spring to use one of them for dependency injection, you need to use @Autowired.

4. **Consistency**: If you're working in a large codebase where @Autowired is used everywhere, it might be better to continue using it for the sake of consistency.

In conclusion, while it's not necessary to use @Autowired on single-constructor classes anymore, there are still situations where it can be useful or necessary.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `@Autowired` annotation is indeed not necessary for constructor injection since Spring 4.3. If a class only declares one constructor, Spring will use that constructor for dependency injection even if it's not annotated with `@Autowired`.

However, there are a few reasons why you might still see `@Autowired` being used:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: If the codebase needs to be compatible with older versions of Spring that do not support automatic constructor injection, `@Autowired` is still required.

2. **Explicitness**: Using `@Autowired` makes it clear that Spring is managing the dependency injection. This can make the code easier to understand for developers who are not familiar with the newer Spring features.

3. **Multiple Constructors**: If a class has more than one constructor, Spring won't know which one to use for dependency injection. In this case, `@Autowired` is necessary to indicate the constructor to use.

4. **Consistency**: Some teams may prefer to use `@Autowired` consistently across all injection points for consistency, even though it's not necessary for constructor injection.

In general, if you're using Spring 4.3 or later and only have one constructor in your class, you can safely omit the `@Autowired` annotation.
