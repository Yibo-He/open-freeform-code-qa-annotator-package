I just installed Xdebug v3.0.0beta1 on my OSX and tried to use it on PhpStorm 2020.1, but I get this :
> Xdebug: [Config] The setting 'xdebug.remote_enable' has been renamed,
see the upgrading guide at
[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable)
(See: [https://xdebug.org/docs/errors#CFG-C-CHANGED](https://xdebug.org/docs/errors#CFG-C-CHANGED)) Xdebug: [Config]

[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port)
And the links provided lead to nothing but an image with bugs.
My question is what are the right settings to set and where to actually change them since i have nothing about xdebug in my php.ini file.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message you received indicates that some of the Xdebug configuration settings have been renamed in version 3.0.0beta1. To fix this issue, you need to update your Xdebug configuration settings in your php.ini file or in your Xdebug configuration file.

Here are the new configuration settings that you need to use:

- `xdebug.mode` replaces `xdebug.remote_enable`
- `xdebug.client_host` replaces `xdebug.remote_host`
- `xdebug.start_with_request` replaces `xdebug.remote_mode`
- `xdebug.client_port` replaces `xdebug.remote_port`

To update your configuration settings, you can add the following lines to your php.ini file:

```
[xdebug]
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=localhost
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_port=9003
```

Make sure to replace `localhost` with your server's IP address if you're debugging a remote server. Also, make sure that the `xdebug.so` extension is loaded in your PHP configuration.

If you're still having issues, you can try creating an Xdebug configuration file named `.xdebug.ini` in your project's root directory and add the above configuration settings to it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message you received indicates that the configuration settings for Xdebug have changed in version 3.0.0beta1. You will need to update your configuration settings in order to use Xdebug with PhpStorm 2020.1.

To update your configuration settings, you will need to add the following lines to your php.ini file:

```
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
```

These settings will enable Xdebug to connect to PhpStorm and allow you to debug your PHP code.

If you do not have an existing php.ini file, you can create one by copying the php.ini-development file that is included with your PHP installation. You can then add the above lines to the end of the file.

Once you have updated your configuration settings, you should be able to use Xdebug with PhpStorm 2020.1.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message you received indicates that some of the Xdebug configuration settings have been renamed in version 3.0.0beta1. To fix this issue, you need to update your Xdebug configuration settings in your php.ini file or in your Xdebug configuration file.

Here are the new configuration settings that you need to use:

- `xdebug.mode` replaces `xdebug.remote_enable`
- `xdebug.client_host` replaces `xdebug.remote_host`
- `xdebug.start_with_request` replaces `xdebug.remote_mode`
- `xdebug.client_port` replaces `xdebug.remote_port`

To update your configuration settings, you can follow these steps:

1. Locate your php.ini file. You can find the location of your php.ini file by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   php --ini
   ```

   This will display the location of your php.ini file.

2. Open your php.ini file in a text editor.

3. Search for the Xdebug configuration settings. If you don't find any Xdebug configuration settings, you can add them to the end of the file.

4. Replace the old configuration settings with the new ones.

   For example, if you had the following configuration settings:

   ```
   xdebug.remote_enable = 1
   xdebug.remote_host = localhost
   xdebug.remote_mode = req
   xdebug.remote_port = 9000
   ```

   You should replace them with:

   ```
   xdebug.mode = debug
   xdebug.client_host = localhost
   xdebug.start_with_request = yes
   xdebug.client_port = 9000
   ```

5. Save the changes to your php.ini file.

6. Restart your web server to apply the changes.

After updating your Xdebug configuration settings, you should be able to use Xdebug with PhpStorm 2020.1 without any issues.
