Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to enable Dev Tools in IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2 and observe the changes in code without having to restart the Tomcat server.

1. **Install and Enable Dev Tools**

   First, you need to add the Spring Boot DevTools to your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml` file:

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
           <optional>true</optional>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

   If you're using Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Automatic Restart**

   By default, any changes to the classpath will trigger a restart. This can be configured in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. Here's how to enable it:

   ```properties
   spring.devtools.restart.enabled=true
   ```

3. **Configure IntelliJ IDEA**

   IntelliJ IDEA does not automatically compile files when the application is running. You need to enable the "Make project automatically" option.

   - Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `Preferences` for macOS)
   - Navigate to `Build, Execution, Deployment` -> `Compiler`
   - Check the `Build project automatically` option

   After that, you need to enable the automatic trigger of this compilation when changes are detected:

   - Use the shortcut `Shift + Ctrl + Alt + /` (for Windows/Linux) or `Shift + Command + Option + /` (for macOS)
   - Select `Registry...`
   - Find and enable `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`

4. **Run Your Application**

   Now, you can run your application. Any changes you make to the code will be automatically compiled and the application will be restarted.

Please note that not all changes will trigger a full restart. For example, changes to `public static void main(String[] args)` methods, `pom.xml`, and changes to the configurations in `application.properties` or `application.yml` will trigger a full restart. Other changes, like adding, removing, or modifying methods or classes, will only trigger a live reload.

Sure, here is a step-by-step guide on how to enable Dev Tools in IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2 and observe changes in code without having to restart the Tomcat server.

1. **Add DevTools Dependency:**
   First, you need to add the Spring Boot DevTools dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
           <optional>true</optional>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

   If you're using Gradle, add this to your `build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
   }
   ```

2. **Enable Automatic Restart:**
   By default, any classpath file changes will trigger a restart. DevTools needs to be set up in your IDE to make sure that the classpath is updated correctly. The way to do this in IntelliJ IDEA is to enable the "Make project automatically" option.

   - Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler`
   - Check the `Build project automatically` option.

3. **Enable Automatic Restart on Save:**
   For changes to take effect immediately, you need to also enable the automatic restart or hot swapping after you save a file.

   - Use the shortcut `Ctrl+Shift+A` (or `Cmd+Shift+A` on Mac) and search for the `Registry...` option.
   - In the registry, enable `compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running`.

4. **Update Running Application:**
   After you've made some changes in your code, you can apply them using the `Update` action (`Ctrl+F10` on Windows/Linux, `Cmd+F10` on macOS). This will update the classes and resources.

5. **Run Your Application:**
   Now, run your application. Whenever you make changes to your code, the server will automatically restart to apply the changes.

Please note that not all changes will be applied immediately: some changes (like adding new methods or classes) will require a full restart, not a hot swap.

Sure, here's a step-by-step guide on how to enable Dev Tools in IntelliJ IDEA 2021.2 and observe the changes in code without having to restart the Tomcat server.

1. **Install and Enable Dev Tools**

   First, you need to add the Spring Boot DevTools dependency to your project. If you're using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
           <artifactId>spring-boot-devtools</artifactId>
           <optional>true</optional>
       </dependency>
   </dependencies>
   ```

   If you're using Gradle, add the following dependency to your `build.gradle`:

   ```groovy
   dependencies {
       developmentOnly("org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-devtools")
   }
   ```

   After adding the dependency, make sure to re-import the changes in your Maven or Gradle project in IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Enable Automatic Restart**

   By default, any changes in your code will trigger a restart of the application. However, you need to ensure that the "Update" action is set to "Update classes and resources" in IntelliJ IDEA.

   To do this, go to `Run -> Edit Configurations... -> Spring Boot -> [Your application] -> Update action` and select `Update classes and resources`.

3. **Enable Automatic Build**

   To make sure that your code is automatically compiled after you save changes, go to `File -> Settings (Preferences for macOS) -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Compiler` and check `Build project automatically`.

4. **Enable Hot Swapping**

   Hot swapping allows the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) to update classes without restarting the entire application. To enable hot swapping in IntelliJ IDEA, go to `Run -> Edit Configurations... -> Spring Boot -> [Your application] -> Running Application Update Policy` and select `On frame deactivation`.

5. **Start Your Application**

   Now, you can start your Spring Boot application in IntelliJ IDEA. Any changes you make in your code will be automatically compiled and updated in the running application, without having to restart the Tomcat server.

Please note that not all changes can be hot-swapped. Some changes, like adding new methods or classes, will still require a full restart.
