I developed a repo on computer A and created a go.mod/go.sum that I checked in.

I pull that repo with the go.mod/go.sum files on computer B, but when I try to build the program, the module constraints can't be satisfied.

```
$ go build
go: finding github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client v0.1.5
go: finding golang.org/x/tools v0.0.0-20180221164845-07fd8470d635
go: github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5: unknown revision v0.1.5
go: error loading module requirements
```


The repo that is failing is a private repo, and for some reason it doesn't get downloaded to the module cache. On another computer, the dependencies are downloaded and the build succeeds. I am building another private repo in that same domain, so I know that my github credentials give me access to these repos. But for some reason, the go module system can't get to the dependent repo.

I cannot find more information how to debug this.

The error message you're seeing indicates that Go is unable to find the specific version of the module you're trying to import. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Network Issues**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection and you are able to access the repository URL from your browser or using a git command.

2. **Authentication Issues**: Since the repository is private, you need to make sure that your credentials are correctly set up on computer B. Go uses the same authentication as Git, so you can check if you're able to clone the repository using `git clone`.

3. **Proxy Settings**: If you're using a proxy, you need to make sure that it's correctly configured. You can check your current settings with `go env`.

4. **Incorrect Version**: The version `v0.1.5` might not exist in the repository. You can check the available versions in the repository and update your `go.mod` file accordingly.

To debug this issue, you can use the `-x` flag with the `go build` command to print out more information about what's happening:

```bash
go build -x
```

This will print out all the commands that `go build` is running under the hood, which might give you more insight into what's going wrong.

If you're still having trouble, you can try deleting your `go.sum` file and running `go build` again. The `go.sum` file is used to ensure that future downloads of these modules retrieve the same bits as the first download, to ensure the modules your project depends on do not change unexpectedly, whether for malicious, accidental, or other reasons. Go will automatically recreate the `go.sum` file as needed.

```bash
rm go.sum
go build
```

Remember to check your `go.mod` file for any syntax errors or incorrect module paths.

The error message indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`. Here are a few things you can try to debug this issue:

1. **Check the Version**: Ensure that the version `v0.1.5` of the module `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists. You can check this by visiting the repository on your browser.

2. **Check the Access**: Even though you have access to the domain, it's possible that you might not have access to this specific repository. Try cloning the repository directly to see if you have access.

3. **Check the Go Proxy**: Go uses a module proxy by default (https://proxy.golang.org). If your module is private, you need to tell Go to bypass the proxy for your module. You can do this by setting the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable to match your module path. For example, you can use `export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms/*` to bypass the proxy for all modules in the `github.ibm.com/kms` domain.

4. **Check the Git Configuration**: Go uses Git to download modules. Ensure that Git is correctly configured on your machine and that you can clone the repository using Git.

5. **Check the Go Version**: Ensure that you're using the same version of Go on both machines. Different versions of Go might handle modules differently.

6. **Verbose Logging**: You can use the `-v` flag with `go get` to get more verbose output, which might help you debug the issue. For example, `go get -v github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client`.

7. **Clear the Go Cache**: Sometimes, the Go cache can cause issues. You can clear the Go cache by running `go clean -modcache`.

Remember to replace `github.ibm.com/kms/*` with your actual module path.

The error message `unknown revision v0.1.5` indicates that Go is unable to find the specified version of the module in your private repository. Here are a few things you can try to debug this issue:

1. **Check the version**: Ensure that the version `v0.1.5` of `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client` actually exists in your private repository. If not, you may need to push this version to the repository or adjust your `go.mod` file to require a version that does exist.

2. **Check your GOPRIVATE environment variable**: Go 1.13 introduced the `GOPRIVATE` environment variable, which you can use to specify a comma-separated list of glob patterns (like `github.ibm.com/kms/*`) for paths that should always be fetched privately. If you're using Go 1.13 or later, try setting this variable and see if it resolves your issue.

    ```bash
    export GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com/kms/*
    ```

3. **Check your Git configuration**: Ensure that Git is correctly configured to access your private repository. You can do this by trying to manually clone the repository using Git. If this fails, you may need to update your Git configuration or SSH keys.

4. **Check your network connection**: If you're on a different network with computer B, there might be network restrictions preventing you from accessing the private repository. Try switching networks or disabling any VPNs or proxies to see if this resolves the issue.

5. **Clear your Go module cache**: Sometimes, issues can be caused by a corrupted module cache. You can clear your module cache by running `go clean -modcache`.

6. **Increase verbosity of `go get`**: You can use the `-x` flag with `go get` to see more details about what's happening. This might give you more information about why the module fetch is failing.

    ```bash
    go get -x github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
    ```

Remember to replace `github.ibm.com/kms/*` and `github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5` with your actual repository path and version.
