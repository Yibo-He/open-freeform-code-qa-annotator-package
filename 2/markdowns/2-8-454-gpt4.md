I've been playing with Go modules and I was wondering what the best practice is in terms of the following directory structure:

```
project
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── players
    ├── go.mod
    ├── players.go
    └── players_test.go
```


I was having problems importing the `players` package into my root project at first, but I noticed I could do this in the root `go.mod` file

```
module github.com/<name>/<project>

require (
    github.com/<name>/players v0.0.0
)

replace github.com/<name>/players => ./players
```


This then allows me to do `import "github.com/<name>/players"` in my `main.go` file.

Now this approach works and was taken from [here](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#can-i-work-entirely-outside-of-vcs-on-my-local-filesystem) but I'm not sure if that's the correct approach for this or whether this approach is just meant for updating a local package temporarily while it's outside version control.

Another option, that seems a little overkill, is to make every module its own repository?

TL;DR; - What's the best practice approach to having multiple modules within the same repository and importing them in in other modules / a root `main.go` file?

The best practice for structuring Go projects with multiple modules is to have a single `go.mod` file at the root of your project and then organize your code into packages (not modules) based on their functionality. Each package should be in its own directory under the root of the project. 

In your case, you would have:

```
project
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── players
    ├── players.go
    └── players_test.go
```

And your `go.mod` file would look like:

```
module github.com/<name>/<project>

go 1.14
```

Then, in your `main.go` file, you can import the `players` package like this:

```go
import "github.com/<name>/<project>/players"
```

This approach is simpler and more idiomatic in Go. It avoids the complexity of managing multiple modules and makes the import paths more straightforward.

Creating a separate module for each package or making every module its own repository is usually not necessary unless the packages are intended to be used independently by different projects. In that case, each package would indeed be its own module and would have its own `go.mod` file. But for most projects, a single module with multiple packages is the recommended approach.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The best practice for Go projects is to have a single `go.mod` file at the root of your project. This means that all packages in your project are part of the same module. This is the most common approach and it simplifies dependency management.

Your directory structure would look like this:

```
project
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── players
    ├── players.go
    └── players_test.go
```

And you would import the `players` package in your `main.go` file like this:

```go
import "github.com/<name>/<project>/players"
```

The approach you mentioned with multiple `go.mod` files and the `replace` directive in the root `go.mod` file is not recommended for most use cases. It's more complex and it can lead to problems with dependency management. It's mainly intended for developing and testing local replacements for remote modules.

The approach of making every module its own repository is also not recommended for most use cases. It can make sense if you have modules that are independently versioned and maintained, but for a typical project it's overkill and it can make the project harder to manage.

So in summary, the best practice is to have a single `go.mod` file at the root of your project and to structure your project as a single module with multiple packages.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The best practice for structuring Go projects with multiple modules is to have a single `go.mod` file at the root of your project and to structure your packages as subdirectories of the root. This is the simplest and most straightforward way to manage dependencies and it's the approach recommended by the Go team.

In your case, the directory structure would look like this:

```
project
├── go.mod
├── main.go
└── players
    ├── players.go
    └── players_test.go
```

And your `go.mod` file would look like this:

```
module github.com/<name>/<project>

go 1.x
```

Then, in your `main.go` file, you can import the `players` package like this:

```go
import "github.com/<name>/<project>/players"
```

This approach works well for most projects. If you have a very large project with many dependencies, you might consider splitting it into multiple modules, each with its own `go.mod` file. However, this adds complexity and should only be done if necessary.

Creating a separate repository for each module is generally not recommended, unless the modules are intended to be used independently by other projects. It adds overhead in terms of version control and dependency management, and it can make the project harder to understand and maintain.
