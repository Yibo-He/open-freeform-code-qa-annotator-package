I have seen many people using `@Autowired` annotation in constructor to inject dependencies like as shown below
```
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;
 
 @Autowired
 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```

as per my knowledge nowadays Spring is so advanced and the Spring constructor/setter DI works even without `@Autowired` like as shown below
```
@Service
public class Employee {

 private EmployeeService employeeService;

 public Employee(EmployeeService employeeService) {
   this.employeeService = employeeService;
 }
 :
 :
}
```

Like to know is there any reason why people annotate constructor with `@Autowired` annotation to inject dependencies.
Can someone please help me on this

You are correct that Spring's constructor injection works without the `@Autowired` annotation. However, using `@Autowired` on the constructor has some benefits:

1. It makes the code more readable and explicit: By using `@Autowired` on the constructor, you are explicitly stating that the dependency is required for the class to function properly. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. It helps with testing: When you use `@Autowired` on the constructor, it becomes easier to write unit tests for the class. You can simply pass in a mock object for the dependency in the constructor and test the class in isolation.

3. It helps with refactoring: If you need to change the dependency in the future, you can simply update the constructor parameter and Spring will take care of the rest. This makes refactoring easier and less error-prone.

In summary, while it is not necessary to use `@Autowired` on the constructor, it can make the code more readable, easier to test, and easier to refactor.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You are correct that Spring's constructor/setter DI works even without `@Autowired` annotation. However, using `@Autowired` annotation in the constructor has some advantages over the traditional setter injection.

1. It makes the code more readable and explicit: By using `@Autowired` annotation in the constructor, you are explicitly stating that this class requires this dependency to function. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.

2. It ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation: When you use constructor injection with `@Autowired` annotation, Spring ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation. This means that the object is in a fully initialized state when it is returned to the caller.

3. It makes the class immutable: When you use constructor injection with `@Autowired` annotation, you are making the class immutable. Once the object is created, the dependency cannot be changed. This makes the class more predictable and easier to test.

4. It helps in avoiding circular dependencies: When you use constructor injection with `@Autowired` annotation, Spring can detect circular dependencies and throw an exception at the time of object creation. This helps in avoiding runtime errors and makes the code more robust.

In summary, using `@Autowired` annotation in the constructor has some advantages over the traditional setter injection. It makes the code more readable, ensures that the dependency is injected at the time of object creation, makes the class immutable, and helps in avoiding circular dependencies.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You are correct that Spring's constructor injection works without the `@Autowired` annotation. However, using `@Autowired` on the constructor has some benefits:

1. It makes the code more readable and easier to understand. When you see the `@Autowired` annotation on the constructor, you know that the class has dependencies that are being injected.

2. It makes the code more explicit. By using `@Autowired` on the constructor, you are explicitly stating that the dependencies are required for the class to function properly.

3. It makes the code more testable. When you use constructor injection with `@Autowired`, you can easily create instances of the class in your tests and pass in mock dependencies.

4. It helps prevent circular dependencies. When you use constructor injection with `@Autowired`, Spring will throw an exception if it detects a circular dependency. This can help you catch and fix issues early on.

In summary, while it is not necessary to use `@Autowired` on the constructor, it can make your code more readable, explicit, testable, and help prevent circular dependencies.
