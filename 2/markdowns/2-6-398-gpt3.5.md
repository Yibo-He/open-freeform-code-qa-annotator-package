I've configured my console application's `Main` like so
```
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```

And then I try to use it in another class like so
```
private readonly ILogger _logger;
    
public MyClass(ILogger logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```

> System.InvalidOperationException: 'Unable to resolve service for type
'Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.ILogger'
I've tried the solutions [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51329388/2025666) but it didn't work for me.

Based on Yaakov's comment below and [this Github comment](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle.AspNetCore/issues/92#issuecomment-223991293) I'm able to resolve it correctly by doing this
```
public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}
```

I would have preferred to have this in the initial `BuildServiceProvider` but looks like I'm gonna have to repeat this every time I want to use the logger (or create my own ILogger).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, that's correct. The `ILogger<T>` interface is a generic interface that allows you to specify the type of the class that is using the logger. This is useful because it allows the logging framework to provide more context about where the log message is coming from.

When you register the logging service in the `ServiceCollection`, you can specify the default logger factory and the minimum log level, but you cannot specify the type of the logger. That's why you need to use the `ILogger<T>` interface when injecting the logger into your classes.

If you don't want to repeat the `ILogger<T>` declaration in every class that uses the logger, you can create your own interface that inherits from `ILogger<T>` and use that instead. For example:

```
public interface IMyLogger<T> : ILogger<T>
{
}

public class MyClass
{
    private readonly IMyLogger<MyClass> _logger;

    public MyClass(IMyLogger<MyClass> logger)
    {
        _logger = logger;
    }

    public void MyFunc()
    {
        _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
    }
}
```

Then, you can register your custom logger interface in the `ServiceCollection` like this:

```
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient(typeof(IMyLogger<>), typeof(Logger<>))
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```

This will allow you to use `IMyLogger<T>` instead of `ILogger<T>` in your classes, while still using the default logging configuration.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, that's correct. The reason for this is that the `ILogger` interface is generic, and it needs to know the type of the class that is using it in order to properly log messages. 

When you use `ILogger<MyClass>`, you are telling the logger that it should log messages for the `MyClass` class. If you were to use `ILogger<AnotherClass>`, it would log messages for that class instead.

So, unfortunately, you will need to specify the type of the class that is using the logger every time you want to use it. Alternatively, you could create your own interface that inherits from `ILogger` and specify the type there, so you don't have to repeat it every time.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, that's correct. When you register the logging service in the `ServiceCollection`, you need to specify the type of logger you want to use. In your case, you want to use a logger for `MyClass`, so you need to specify `ILogger<MyClass>` instead of just `ILogger`. 

If you want to avoid repeating this every time you want to use the logger, you can create your own `ILogger` implementation that automatically resolves the correct logger type based on the class it's being used in. Here's an example implementation:

```
public class ClassLogger<T> : ILogger<T>
{
    private readonly ILogger _logger;

    public ClassLogger(ILoggerFactory factory)
    {
        _logger = factory.CreateLogger(typeof(T).FullName);
    }

    public IDisposable BeginScope<TState>(TState state)
    {
        return _logger.BeginScope(state);
    }

    public bool IsEnabled(LogLevel logLevel)
    {
        return _logger.IsEnabled(logLevel);
    }

    public void Log<TState>(LogLevel logLevel, EventId eventId, TState state, Exception exception, Func<TState, Exception, string> formatter)
    {
        _logger.Log(logLevel, eventId, state, exception, formatter);
    }
}
```

You can then register this logger implementation in the `ServiceCollection` like so:

```
var services = new ServiceCollection()
    .AddLogging(logging => logging.AddConsole())
    .AddTransient(typeof(ILogger<>), typeof(ClassLogger<>))
    .BuildServiceProvider();
```

With this implementation, you can now use the logger in your classes like this:

```
private readonly ILogger<MyClass> _logger;

public MyClass(ILogger<MyClass> logger)
{
    _logger = logger;
}

public void MyFunc()
{
    _logger.Log(LogLevel.Error, "My Message");
}
```

And you don't need to specify the logger type every time you use it.
