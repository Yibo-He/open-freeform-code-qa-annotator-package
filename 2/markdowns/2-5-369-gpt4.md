I can't seem to find my local changes in Intellij Idea's latest version (2020.1), as you can see in the image below. What am I missing here? The "Git" tab only shows the Git log.

The image you've provided doesn't show up here, but I understand your issue. In IntelliJ IDEA, local changes are now shown in a dedicated tab in the Git tool window.

Here's how you can find it:

1. Open the `Version Control` tool window (Alt + 9 on Windows/Linux, Command + 9 on macOS).
2. Click on the `Git` tab.
3. You should see a `Local Changes` tab there.

If you can't see the `Local Changes` tab, it might be because the non-modal commit interface is disabled. You can enable it by:

1. Go to `File` -> `Settings` (or `Preferences` for macOS).
2. Navigate to `Version Control` -> `Commit`.
3. Check the `Use non-modal commit interface` option.
4. Click `Apply` and then `OK`.

After enabling the non-modal commit interface, you should be able to see your local changes in the `Git` tab of the `Version Control` tool window.

In IntelliJ IDEA, local changes are now shown in a dedicated tab in the Git tool window. You can find it at the bottom of the IDE. 

Here are the steps to view your local changes:

1. Click on the "Version Control" tab (or press `Alt + 9` on Windows/Linux, `Command + 9` on macOS).
2. In the tool window that opens, click on the "Git" tab.
3. You should see a "Local Changes" tab in the Git tool window.

If you can't see the "Local Changes" tab, it might be because the new UI for the Git tool window is disabled. You can enable it by following these steps:

1. Go to "File" -> "Settings" (or press `Ctrl + Alt + S` on Windows/Linux, `Command + ,` on macOS).
2. In the "Settings" window, navigate to "Version Control" -> "Git".
3. Check the box that says "Use non-modal commit interface".
4. Click "Apply" and then "OK".

After doing this, you should be able to see your local changes in the Git tool window.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In IntelliJ IDEA, local changes are now shown in a dedicated tab in the Git tool window. However, in the latest version (2020.1), the tab's name has been changed from "Local Changes" to "Commit".

To view your local changes, follow these steps:

1. Open the Git tool window. You can do this by going to "View" > "Tool Windows" > "Git", or by pressing Alt + 9 on Windows/Linux or Command + 9 on macOS.

2. In the Git tool window, click on the "Commit" tab. This tab shows all your local changes, grouped by the change type (Unversioned Files, Modifications, etc.).

3. If you want to see the diff for a file, just double-click on the file name.

4. If you can't see the "Commit" tab, make sure you have a Git repository in your project. If you don't, you can add one by going to "VCS" > "Import into Version Control" > "Create Git Repository".

5. If you still can't see the "Commit" tab, it might be hidden. You can unhide it by clicking on the gear icon in the Git tool window and making sure "Commit" is checked.

Remember, the "Commit" tab not only shows your local changes, but also allows you to commit them directly from there.
