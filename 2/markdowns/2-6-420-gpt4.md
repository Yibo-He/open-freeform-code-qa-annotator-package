net core application. I have added azure ad authentication. Below is my startup.cs file
```
services.AddAuthentication(x =>
            {
                x.DefaultAuthenticateScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
                x.DefaultChallengeScheme = JwtBearerDefaults.AuthenticationScheme;
            })
            .AddJwtBearer(options =>
            {
                options.SaveToken = true;
                options.RequireHttpsMetadata = true;
                options.Authority = $"{authSettings.Authority}/{authSettings.TenantId}";
                options.Audience = authSettings.ClientId;
                options.TokenValidationParameters = new TokenValidationParameters
                {
                    ValidateAudience = true,
                    ValidateLifetime = true,
                    ValidateIssuer = true,
                    ValidateIssuerSigningKey = false,
                    ValidateActor = false,
                };
            });
```

I have deployed application to azure app service. It deployed successfully. I opened swagger and authenticated and tried to hit api. It throws me 500 error. I went to azure app service log stream. It shows me below error message.

I have set AzureAd:Authority to [https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) in app service app settings configurations. Can someone help me to understand this issue? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you

The error message you're seeing is indicating that the Authority URL you're using is not using HTTPS. The error message is: 

```
System.InvalidOperationException: The MetadataAddress or Authority must use HTTPS unless disabled for development by setting RequireHttpsMetadata=false.
```

This error is thrown because the `RequireHttpsMetadata` property is set to `true` in your `AddJwtBearer` options, which means that the Authority URL must use HTTPS.

You mentioned that you have set `AzureAd:Authority` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` in your app settings, which is correct and it is using HTTPS. 

However, the issue might be in the way you're constructing the Authority URL in your `AddJwtBearer` options:

```csharp
options.Authority = $"{authSettings.Authority}/{authSettings.TenantId}";
```

Make sure that `authSettings.Authority` and `authSettings.TenantId` are correctly set and that they form a valid HTTPS URL when combined. 

You can try to print out the final Authority URL to the console or log it to make sure it's correct:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine($"{authSettings.Authority}/{authSettings.TenantId}");
```

If the URL is correct and the error persists, you might want to check if there's a network issue that prevents your app from accessing the Authority URL via HTTPS. 

If you're running in a development environment and you want to bypass this check, you can set `RequireHttpsMetadata` to `false`, but this is not recommended for production environments:

```csharp
options.RequireHttpsMetadata = false;
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `Authority` URL you're using for your JWT Bearer authentication is not using HTTPS. This is a requirement for production environments, as indicated by the `RequireHttpsMetadata = true` setting in your `AddJwtBearer` configuration.

The `Authority` URL is used to retrieve the public signing keys that are used to validate the JWT token. This URL must be secured with HTTPS to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

You mentioned that you have set `AzureAd:Authority` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` in your app service settings. However, the error message suggests that the `Authority` URL being used is not using HTTPS.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Ensure that the `AzureAd:Authority` setting in your app service is indeed set to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` and not `http://login.microsoftonline.com/` (note the 's' in 'https').

2. Check the `authSettings.Authority` and `authSettings.TenantId` values at runtime to ensure they are what you expect. It's possible that these values are not being correctly loaded from your app service settings.

3. If you're using a custom domain for your Azure AD tenant, ensure that it is correctly configured to use HTTPS.

4. If you're running in a development environment and you want to bypass the HTTPS requirement for testing purposes, you can set `RequireHttpsMetadata = false`. However, this should not be done in a production environment.

If you've checked all of these and you're still seeing the error, it would be helpful to see more of your code to further diagnose the issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `Authority` URL you're using for your JWT Bearer authentication is not using HTTPS. This is a requirement unless you've set the `RequireHttpsMetadata` property to `false`.

You mentioned that you've set the `AzureAd:Authority` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` in your app service configurations. However, the error suggests that this URL is not being used or not being used correctly.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your configuration settings:** Make sure that the `AzureAd:Authority` setting in your Azure App Service configuration matches exactly with what you're expecting. Remember that configuration settings in Azure are case-sensitive.

2. **Check your `authSettings` object:** Ensure that the `authSettings` object in your `Startup.cs` file is correctly reading the `Authority` and `TenantId` values from your configuration. You can add some logging to your application to confirm this.

3. **Check the `Authority` URL:** The `Authority` URL should be in the format `https://login.microsoftonline.com/{TenantId}`. Make sure that the `TenantId` is being appended correctly to the `Authority` URL.

4. **Check for network issues:** There could be a network issue preventing your application from connecting to the `Authority` URL. You can test this by trying to access the `Authority` URL from your local machine or another network.

If you've checked all of these and you're still seeing the issue, you may need to do some more in-depth debugging to figure out what's going wrong.
