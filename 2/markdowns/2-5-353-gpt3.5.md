As a developer, I use the default `dev` profile in my local development environment. Here is part of my `application-dev.properties` file:
```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.include=auth
```

Previously I  used Spring Boot 2.3.0.RELEASE and the `spring.profiles.include` property included `auth` profile at runtime.
But after I migrated to Spring Boot 2.4.0, I don't get the `auth` profile enabled. `spring.profiles.include` property doesn't seem to work as before.
Please tell me how I can configure my profiles so that I get the same result as before migration. (I would not like to use profile groups here)
Thanks in advance!

Starting from Spring Boot 2.4.0, the `spring.profiles.include` property no longer works as before. Instead, you need to use the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property to activate additional profiles.

To achieve the same result as before migration, you can modify your `application-dev.properties` file as follows:

```
# Profiles    
spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth
```

This will activate the `auth` profile in addition to the `dev` profile when running your application with the `dev` profile.

Note that the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property can also be used to activate multiple profiles by separating them with a comma. For example:

```
spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth,db
```

This will activate both the `auth` and `db` profiles in addition to the `dev` profile.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Starting from Spring Boot 2.4.0, the behavior of `spring.profiles.include` has changed. Previously, it was possible to include profiles at runtime using this property, but now it only includes profiles during the application context initialization.

To achieve the same result as before migration, you can use the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property instead. This property activates the specified profiles during the application context initialization and at runtime.

Here is an example of how you can configure your profiles using `spring.config.activate.on-profile`:

```
# Profiles
spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth,dev
```

This configuration activates both `auth` and `dev` profiles during the application context initialization and at runtime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Starting from Spring Boot 2.4.0, the behavior of `spring.profiles.include` property has changed. It no longer includes the specified profiles at runtime. Instead, it only includes them during the configuration phase.

To achieve the same result as before migration, you can use the `spring.profiles.active` property to activate the `auth` profile at runtime. Here's how you can modify your `application-dev.properties` file:

```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.active=dev,auth
```

This will activate both the `dev` and `auth` profiles at runtime. You can also set the `spring.profiles.active` property as an environment variable or a command-line argument when running your application.

Alternatively, you can use profile groups to achieve the same result. Here's an example:

```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.groups=dev,auth
```

This will activate both the `dev` and `auth` profiles at runtime. However, note that profile groups are deprecated in Spring Boot 2.4.0 and will be removed in a future release. Therefore, it's recommended to use the `spring.profiles.active` property instead.
