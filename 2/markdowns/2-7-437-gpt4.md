I just installed Xdebug v3.0.0beta1 on my OSX and tried to use it on PhpStorm 2020.1, but I get this :
> Xdebug: [Config] The setting 'xdebug.remote_enable' has been renamed,
see the upgrading guide at
[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_enable)
(See: [https://xdebug.org/docs/errors#CFG-C-CHANGED](https://xdebug.org/docs/errors#CFG-C-CHANGED)) Xdebug: [Config]

[https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port](https://xdebug.org/docs/upgrade_guide#changed-xdebug.remote_port)
And the links provided lead to nothing but an image with bugs.
My question is what are the right settings to set and where to actually change them since i have nothing about xdebug in my php.ini file.

The settings you mentioned have been renamed in Xdebug 3.0.0. Here are the new names for these settings:

- `xdebug.remote_enable` is now `xdebug.mode`
- `xdebug.remote_host` is now `xdebug.client_host`
- `xdebug.remote_mode` is now removed in Xdebug 3.0.0
- `xdebug.remote_port` is now `xdebug.client_port`

You should add these settings to your php.ini file. Here's an example of how you can set them:

```
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
```

The `xdebug.mode` setting accepts different values. If you want to use Xdebug for step debugging, you should set it to `debug`. If you want to use it for development aids, you should set it to `develop`. If you want to use it for both, you should set it to `debug,develop`.

The `xdebug.client_host` setting should be set to the IP address of the machine where your IDE is running. If your IDE is running on the same machine as your web server, you can set it to `127.0.0.1`.

The `xdebug.client_port` setting should be set to the port number that your IDE is listening on for Xdebug connections. The default port number for Xdebug 3.0.0 is `9003`.

After you have added these settings to your php.ini file, you should restart your web server for the changes to take effect.

The error messages you're seeing are because Xdebug 3 has changed some of its configuration settings. Here are the new settings that replace the ones you're trying to use:

- `xdebug.remote_enable` has been replaced by `xdebug.mode=debug`
- `xdebug.remote_host` has been replaced by `xdebug.client_host`
- `xdebug.remote_mode` has been removed, and Xdebug 3 will choose the best mode based on the other settings
- `xdebug.remote_port` has been replaced by `xdebug.client_port`

You can set these in your `php.ini` file. If you don't see anything about Xdebug in your `php.ini` file, you can add the settings at the end. Here's an example of what you might add:

```
[xdebug]
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
```

The `xdebug.client_host` should be set to the IP address of the machine running your IDE, and `xdebug.client_port` should be set to the port your IDE is listening on for Xdebug connections. The default port for Xdebug 2 was 9000, but for Xdebug 3 it's 9003.

After you've made these changes, you'll need to restart your web server for the new settings to take effect.

If you're still having trouble, you can use Xdebug's wizard to help you with the installation and configuration. You can find it here: https://xdebug.org/wizard

You just need to paste the output of `phpinfo()` into the text box and it will give you tailored installation instructions.

In Xdebug 3, several configuration settings have been changed or removed. The settings you mentioned have been replaced with the following:

- `xdebug.remote_enable` is replaced by `xdebug.mode=debug`
- `xdebug.remote_host` is replaced by `xdebug.client_host`
- `xdebug.remote_mode` is removed, and the default mode is now 'request'
- `xdebug.remote_port` is replaced by `xdebug.client_port`

You can add these settings in your php.ini file. If you can't find the file, you can create a new one. Here is an example of how you can set these configurations:

```
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
```

Please replace `xdebug.so` with the correct path to your Xdebug extension if necessary. The `xdebug.start_with_request=yes` setting means that Xdebug will attempt to connect to the debugging client as soon as the script starts.

After changing the php.ini file, don't forget to restart your web server to apply the changes. 

In PhpStorm, you should also update the Xdebug port to 9003 (File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | PHP | Debug | Xdebug for Windows/Linux or PhpStorm | Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | PHP | Debug | Xdebug for macOS).
