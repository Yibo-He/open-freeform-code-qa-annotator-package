I'm looking for the correct way to return JSON with a HTTP status code in my .NET Core Web API controller. I use to use it like this:

```
public IHttpActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return this.Content(HttpStatusCode.OK, new { response = "Hello"});
}
```


This was in a 4.6 MVC application but now with .NET Core I don't seem to have this `IHttpActionResult` I have `ActionResult` and using like this:

```
public ActionResult IsAuthenticated()
{
    return Ok(Json("123"));
}
```


But the response from the server is weird, as in the image below:

I just want the Web API controller to return JSON with a HTTP status code like I did in Web API 2.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

In .NET Core, you can use the `Json` method to return JSON data with a specified HTTP status code. Here's an example:

```
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    var data = new { response = "Hello" };
    return Json(data, new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting.Indented });
}
```

In this example, we're returning a JSON object with a `response` property set to `"Hello"`. We're also using the `JsonSerializerSettings` class to specify that the JSON should be indented for readability.

You can also specify the HTTP status code by chaining the `StatusCode` method to the `Json` method:

```
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    var data = new { response = "Hello" };
    return Json(data, new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting.Indented })
        .StatusCode = HttpStatusCode.OK;
}
```

In this example, we're setting the HTTP status code to `OK` (200). You can replace `HttpStatusCode.OK` with any other valid HTTP status code.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

In .NET Core, you can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON data with a HTTP status code. Here's an example:

```
public JsonResult GetResourceData()
{
    return Json(new { response = "Hello" }, new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting.Indented });
}
```

In this example, we're returning a `JsonResult` object with a JSON payload and an HTTP status code of 200 (OK). The `Json` method serializes the object to JSON and sets the content type to `application/json`.

You can also set the HTTP status code explicitly by using the `StatusCode` property of the `JsonResult` object:

```
public JsonResult GetResourceData()
{
    var data = new { response = "Hello" };
    var result = new JsonResult(data);
    result.StatusCode = 200;
    return result;
}
```

This code does the same thing as the previous example, but sets the status code explicitly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

In .NET Core, you can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON data with a HTTP status code. Here's an example:

```
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return Json(new { response = "Hello" });
}
```

This will return a JSON response with a HTTP status code of 200 (OK).

If you want to return a different HTTP status code, you can use the `StatusCode` method like this:

```
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return StatusCode(404, new { error = "Resource not found" });
}
```

This will return a JSON response with a HTTP status code of 404 (Not Found).

Hope this helps!
