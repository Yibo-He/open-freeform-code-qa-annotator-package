I'm trying to write middleware for user authorization in my app. I use this function to check if a route requires being sign in.
The code is as follows:
```
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt'); 

exports.requireSignin = expressJwt({
secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
algorithms: ["HS256"],
userProperty: "auth",});
```

However, I get the following error:
```
TypeError: expressJwt is not a function at Object.<anonymous> (path to the file)\
```

What could be the problem? None of the other answers seem to be helpful.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message suggests that `expressJwt` is not a function. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. `express-jwt` module is not installed: Make sure that you have installed the `express-jwt` module by running `npm install express-jwt` in your project directory.

2. Incorrect import statement: Make sure that you are importing `expressJwt` correctly. It should be imported like this:
```
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

3. Version incompatibility: Check if you are using the correct version of `express-jwt` that supports the `expressJwt` function. If you are using an older version, try updating it to the latest version.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project setup and the versions of the modules you are using.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that `expressJwt` is not a function. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Incorrect import: Make sure that you are importing `expressJwt` correctly. It should be imported from the `jsonwebtoken` package like this:

```
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');

exports.requireSignin = expressJwt({
  secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
  algorithms: ["HS256"],
  userProperty: "auth",
});
```

2. Incorrect package installation: Make sure that you have installed the `express-jwt` package correctly. You can do this by running `npm install express-jwt` in your project directory.

3. Version incompatibility: Make sure that the version of `express-jwt` you are using is compatible with your other dependencies. You can check the version compatibility by looking at the `package.json` file or by running `npm ls express-jwt` in your project directory.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project setup and any other error messages you may be seeing.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message suggests that `expressJwt` is not a function, which means it is not being imported correctly. 

Make sure that you have installed the `express-jwt` package and that you are importing it correctly. You can try changing your import statement to:

```
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt').default;
```

This should import the default export of the `express-jwt` module, which should be the `expressJwt` function.

If this doesn't work, you can try importing the `jsonwebtoken` package and using it directly to verify the JWT token. Here's an example:

```
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');

exports.requireSignin = (req, res, next) => {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(' ')[1];
  if (!token) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authorization failed: No token provided' });
  }
  try {
    const decodedToken = jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
    req.auth = decodedToken;
    next();
  } catch (err) {
    return res.status(401).json({ message: 'Authorization failed: Invalid token' });
  }
};
```

This middleware function checks for the JWT token in the `Authorization` header of the request, verifies it using the `jsonwebtoken` package, and sets the decoded token in the `auth` property of the request object.
