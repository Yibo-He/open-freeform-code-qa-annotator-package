I have a custom  component with an event Action called TabChanged. In my Razor page I set the reference to it up like so:

```
<TabSet @ref="tabSet">
 ...
</TabSet>

@code {
    private TabSet tabSet;   
    ...
}
```


In the  method I assign a handler to the event:

```
protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
{
    if(firstRender)
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }       
}
```


The first time the page renders I get a  error.

If I switch to use subsequent renders it works fine:

```
protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
{
    if(!firstRender)
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }       
}
```


But of course this is sloppy and I will be firing multiple event handlers as they stack up during renders.

How can I assign the reference one time and on first render? I am following the docs as outlined [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/components?view=aspnetcore-3.0#capture-references-to-components)



Here is the TabSet.razor file:

```
@using Components.Tabs

<!-- Display the tab headers -->
<CascadingValue Value="this">
    <ul class="nav nav-tabs">
        @ChildContent
    </ul>
</CascadingValue>

<!-- Display body for only the active tab -->
<div class="nav-tabs-body" style="padding:15px; padding-top:30px;">
    @ActiveTab?.ChildContent
</div>

@code {

    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }

    public ITab ActiveTab { get; private set; }

    public event Action TabChanged;


    public void AddTab(ITab tab)
    {
        if (ActiveTab == null)
        {
            SetActiveTab(tab);
        }
    }

    public void RemoveTab(ITab tab)
    {
        if (ActiveTab == tab)
        {
            SetActiveTab(null);
        }
    }

    public void SetActiveTab(ITab tab)
    {
        if (ActiveTab != tab)
        {
            ActiveTab = tab;
            NotifyStateChanged();
            StateHasChanged();
        }
    }

    private void NotifyStateChanged() => TabChanged?.Invoke();

}
```


TabSet also uses Tab.razor:

```
@using Components.Tabs
@implements ITab

<li>
    <a @onclick="Activate" class="nav-link @TitleCssClass" role="button">
        @Title
    </a>
</li>

@code {
    [CascadingParameter]
    public TabSet ContainerTabSet { get; set; }

    [Parameter]
    public string Title { get; set; }

    [Parameter]
    public RenderFragment ChildContent { get; set; }


    private string TitleCssClass => ContainerTabSet.ActiveTab == this ? "active" : null;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        ContainerTabSet.AddTab(this);
    }

    private void Activate()
    {
        ContainerTabSet.SetActiveTab(this);
    }
}
```


And ITab.cs Interface

```
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components;

namespace PlatformAdmin.Components.Tabs
{
    public interface ITab
    {
        RenderFragment ChildContent { get;  }

        public string Title { get; }
    }
}
```

Here is the debugger showing tabSet is null on first render:

And not null on additional renders:

The issue you're encountering is due to the lifecycle of Blazor components. The `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the component has finished rendering. However, at the time of the first render, the `TabSet` component might not have been fully initialized yet, which is why the `tabSet` reference is null.

To solve this issue, you can use the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method to set up a flag indicating that the component has been rendered at least once. Then, in the `OnParametersSet` or `OnParametersSetAsync` method, you can check this flag and attach the event handler if the component has been rendered:

```csharp
private bool isRendered;

protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
{
    if(firstRender)
    {
        isRendered = true;
    }       
}

protected override void OnParametersSet()
{
    if(isRendered && tabSet != null)
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged -= TabChanged; // To ensure the event is not attached multiple times
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }
}
```

In this code, `OnAfterRenderAsync` sets the `isRendered` flag to true after the first render. Then, `OnParametersSet` checks this flag and the `tabSet` reference, and if they are both valid, it attaches the event handler. The `tabSet.TabChanged -= TabChanged;` line is used to ensure that the event is not attached multiple times if `OnParametersSet` is called multiple times.

This way, the event handler is attached only after the `TabSet` component has been rendered and initialized, and it is attached only once.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue you're facing is due to the lifecycle of Blazor components. The `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the component has finished rendering. However, during the first render, the child content of the component (in this case, the `TabSet` component) has not yet been rendered and hence the reference to `TabSet` is still null.

The solution is to use the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method for the first render to set a flag indicating that the component has been rendered, and then use the `OnParametersSetAsync` method to attach the event handler. The `OnParametersSetAsync` method is called when the component has received parameters from its parent in the render tree, and is the method where you should perform any setup your component requires.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```csharp
@code {
    private TabSet tabSet;   
    private bool isRendered = false;

    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        if(firstRender)
        {
            isRendered = true;
        }       
    }

    protected override async Task OnParametersSetAsync()
    {
        if(isRendered)
        {
            tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
        }       
    }
}
```

In this code, the `isRendered` flag is set to true after the first render. Then, in the `OnParametersSetAsync` method, the event handler is attached only if the component has been rendered. This ensures that the event handler is attached only once, and that it is attached after the `TabSet` component has been rendered and the reference is not null.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're experiencing is due to the lifecycle of Blazor components. The `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the component has finished rendering. However, the `@ref` attribute is not guaranteed to be populated until after the first render of the parent component. This is why `tabSet` is null during the first call to `OnAfterRenderAsync`.

To solve this issue, you can use the `OnParametersSet` or `OnParametersSetAsync` lifecycle methods instead. These methods are called when a component has received parameters from its parent in the render tree, and are suitable for performing logic that needs to occur during component initialization.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```csharp
protected override void OnParametersSet()
{
    tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
}
```

This will ensure that `tabSet` is not null when you're subscribing to the `TabChanged` event. However, be aware that `OnParametersSet` is called each time the parent component renders, so you should add a condition to ensure you only subscribe to the event once:

```csharp
private bool isEventSubscribed = false;

protected override void OnParametersSet()
{
    if (!isEventSubscribed)
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
        isEventSubscribed = true;
    }
}
```

This way, you ensure that the event handler is only added once.
