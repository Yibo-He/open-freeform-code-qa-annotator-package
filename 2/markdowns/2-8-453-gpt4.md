I am using `err113` as part of `golangci-lint`. 

It  is complaining about ...

```
foo_test.go:55:61: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"repo gave err\")" (goerr113)
        repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, errors.New("repo gave err")),
                                                                  ^

foo_test.go:22:42: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"oops\")" (goerr113)
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, errors.New("oops"))
                                            ^
```


What is best way to fix this ?

Quoting [https://github.com/Djarvur/go-err113](https://github.com/Djarvur/go-err113)

> Also, any call of errors.New() and fmt.Errorf() methods are reported
  except the calls used to initialise package-level variables and the
  fmt.Errorf() calls wrapping the other errors.

I am trying to get a idiomatic example for this.

The `err113` linter rule is suggesting that you should use static errors instead of dynamic ones. This means that you should define your errors at the package level and then use them, rather than creating new errors each time. This can be beneficial for error handling and checking, as you can compare errors directly.

Here is an idiomatic example of how you can do this:

```go
package foo

import (
    "errors"
    "testing"

    "github.com/golang/mock/gomock"
)

var (
    ErrRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
    ctrl := gomock.NewController(t)
    defer ctrl.Finish()

    repoMock := NewMockRepo(ctrl)

    repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepo)
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
}
```

In this example, `ErrRepo` and `ErrOops` are package-level variables that hold the error values. These are then returned in the mocked methods instead of creating new errors with `errors.New()`. 

If you need to add more context to your errors, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` to wrap these static errors:

```go
return fmt.Errorf("additional context: %w", ErrRepo)
```

This will create a new error that wraps `ErrRepo`, adding additional context to the error while still allowing direct comparison with `ErrRepo`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The `err113` linter is suggesting that you should use static errors instead of dynamic ones. This is because dynamic errors (like the ones you're creating with `errors.New()`) are not comparable, and this can make error handling more difficult.

To fix this, you should define your errors as package-level variables, and then use those in your code. Here's an example:

```go
var (
    ErrRepoGave = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoGave)
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
    // ...
}
```

This way, the errors are static and can be compared. For example, you can do something like this in your code:

```go
if err == ErrRepoGave {
    // handle this specific error
}
```

If you need to add more context to your errors, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` to wrap your static errors:

```go
return fmt.Errorf("while saving foo: %w", ErrRepoGave)
```

This will still allow you to compare errors using `errors.Is()`, like so:

```go
if errors.Is(err, ErrRepoGave) {
    // handle this specific error
}
```

This is considered more idiomatic in Go, and it's what the `err113` linter is suggesting.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `err113` linter rule is suggesting that you should use static errors, or errors that are defined once and used multiple times, instead of dynamic errors, which are created every time they're used. This is because dynamic errors can be harder to test and debug.

To fix this, you can define your errors at the package level and then use them in your code. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```go
var (
    ErrRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)

// Then in your code, you can use these errors like this:

foo_test.go:55:61: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"repo gave err\")" (goerr113)
        repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepo),
                                                                  ^

foo_test.go:22:42: err113: do not define dynamic errors, use wrapped static errors instead: "errors.New(\"oops\")" (goerr113)
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
                                            ^
```

This way, you're using static errors that are defined once and can be used multiple times, which is more efficient and easier to debug.

If you want to include dynamic information in your errors, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` with `%w` to wrap your static error:

```go
var ErrRepo = errors.New("repo gave err")

func someFunction() error {
    // some code...
    return fmt.Errorf("additional information: %w", ErrRepo)
}
```

This will create a new error that includes the additional information and wraps the original `ErrRepo` error, allowing you to check for `ErrRepo` using `errors.Is()`.
