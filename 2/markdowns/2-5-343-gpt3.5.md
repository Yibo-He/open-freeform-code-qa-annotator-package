A food fest is organised at the JLN stadium. The stalls from different states and cities have been set up. To make the fest more interesting, multiple games have been arranged which can be played by the people to win the food vouchers.One such game to win the food vouchers is described below:
There are N number of boxes arranged in a single queue. Each box has an integer I written on it. From the given queue, the participant has to select two contiguous subsequences A and B of the same size. The selected subsequences should be such that the summation of the product of the boxes should be maximum. The product is not calculated normally though. To make the game interesting, the first box of subsequence A is to be multiplied by the last box of subsequence B. The second box of subsequence A is to be multiplied by the second last box of subsequence B and so on. All the products thus obtained are then added together.
If the participant is able to find the correct such maximum summation, he/she will win the game and will be awarded the food voucher of the same value.
Note: The subsequences A and B should be disjoint.
Example:
Number of boxes, N = 8
The order of the boxes is provided below:

Subsequence A

Subsequence B

The product of the subsequences will be calculated as below:
P1 = 9 * 8 = 72
P2 = 2 * 7 = 14
P3 = 3 * 6 = 18
Summation, S = P1 + P2 + P3 = 72 + 14 + 18 = 104
This is the maximum summation possible as per the requirement for the given N boxes.
Tamanna is also in the fest and wants to play this game. She needs help in winning the game and is asking for your help. Can you help her in winning the food vouchers?
Input Format
The first line of input consists of the number of boxes, N.
The second line of input consists of N space-separated integers.
Constraints
1< N <=3000
-10^6 <= I <=10^6

The approach you have used in your code is not correct for the given problem. The problem requires finding two contiguous subsequences of the same size such that the summation of the product of the boxes is maximum. However, your code is finding the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of different sizes.

To solve the given problem, you can use dynamic programming. You can maintain two arrays, left and right, where left[i] represents the maximum product of a contiguous subsequence of size i starting from the left end of the array, and right[i] represents the maximum product of a contiguous subsequence of size i starting from the right end of the array.

You can fill these arrays using the following recurrence:

left[i] = max(arr[j] * left[i-1], arr[j+1] * left[i-2], ..., arr[i-1] * left[1]), where j = i-1, i-2, ..., i-(i-1)

right[i] = max(arr[j] * right[i-1], arr[j-1] * right[i-2], ..., arr[0] * right[1]), where j = 0, 1, ..., i-1

Once you have filled these arrays, you can iterate over all possible sizes of the two contiguous subsequences and compute their product sum using the left and right arrays. The maximum product sum over all such pairs of subsequences will be the answer to the problem.

Here's the modified code that implements this approach:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }

        // Compute left and right arrays
        long[] left = new long[n+1];
        long[] right = new long[n+1];
        left[0] = right[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.max(arr[i-1], arr[i-1] * left[i-1]);
            right[i] = Math.max(arr[n-i], arr[n-i] * right[i-1]);
        }

        // Compute maximum product sum
        long maxSum = Long.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j <= n-i; j++) {
                long prod = left[i] * right[i] + left[j-i+1] * right[n-j];
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, prod);
            }
        }

        System.out.println(maxSum);
    }
}
```

The code you have provided is not correct for the given problem. It seems like you have tried to solve the problem using a different approach. Here's a correct solution for the problem:

Approach:
- We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for the subarray from i to j.
- We can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
  - If i == j, then dp[i][j] = 0 (as we need two contiguous subsequences of the same size).
  - Otherwise, we can divide the subarray from i to j into two contiguous subsequences A and B of the same size. Let's say the size of each subsequence is k. Then we can calculate the product of the subsequences as follows:
    - P1 = arr[i] * arr[j]
    - P2 = arr[i+1] * arr[j-1]
    - P3 = arr[i+2] * arr[j-2]
    - ...
    - Pk = arr[i+k-1] * arr[j-k+1]
    - The summation of the product of the boxes for the subarray from i to j will be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-k] + dp[i+k][j] + P1 + P2 + ... + Pk)
- The answer to the problem will be dp[0][n-1], where n is the number of boxes.

Time Complexity: O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                for (int k = 1; k < len; k++) {
                    int prod = 0;
                    for (int x = i, y = j; x < i + k && y > j - k; x++, y--) {
                        prod += arr[x] * arr[y];
                    }
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-k] + dp[i+k][j] + prod);
                }
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(dp[0][n-1]);
    }
}
```

There seems to be an issue with your code logic. The current implementation is finding the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of different sizes, but the problem requires finding the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of the same size. 

One approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. You can maintain two arrays, left and right, where left[i] stores the maximum sum of a subarray of size i ending at index i, and right[i] stores the maximum sum of a subarray of size i starting at index i. 

Then, you can iterate over all possible subarray sizes k, and for each size, calculate the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of size k. This can be done by taking the sum of left[i-1] and right[i] for all i from k to n-k, where n is the total number of boxes. 

Finally, you can return the maximum sum obtained over all subarray sizes. 

Here's the modified code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        // calculate left and right arrays
        int[] left = new int[n];
        int[] right = new int[n];
        left[0] = arr[0];
        right[n-1] = arr[n-1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.max(arr[i], left[i-1] + arr[i]);
            right[n-i-1] = Math.max(arr[n-i-1], right[n-i] + arr[n-i-1]);
        }
        
        // calculate maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of same size
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k <= n/2; k++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= n-2*k; i++) {
                sum = Math.max(sum, left[i+k-1] + right[i+k] + getProduct(arr, i, i+k-1, i+k, i+2*k-1));
            }
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        
        System.out.println(maxSum);
    }
    
    // helper function to calculate product of two subarrays
    private static int getProduct(int[] arr, int start1, int end1, int start2, int end2) {
        int product = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < end1-start1+1; i++) {
            product += arr[start1+i] * arr[start2+end1-start1-i];
        }
        return product;
    }
}
``` 

This should solve the problem for you.
