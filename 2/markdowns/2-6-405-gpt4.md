When I debug the code in VS, the cities list, which I am returning have 3 objects in it along with the properties. When I call this endpoint I am receiving a response of 3 list items of empty objects. 

How to resolve this issue?


# Model Class:



```
public class City
{
    public string CityName;
    public string AssociatedCities; 
    public string Province;
    public int Status;

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```



# Endpoint:



```
[HttpGet]
[Route("cities")]
public ActionResult<IEnumerable<City>> GetCities()
{
    return Ok(Cities);
}
```


This is how I am calling the endpoint

```
getCities() {
  this.http.get<City[]>('/api/wizard/cities')
  .subscribe(result => {
    console.log(result);
    this.cities = result;
  }, error => console.error('Something went wrong : ' + error));
}
```


The response I get:

The response that is needed:

```
[
  {
    "SearchCity": "Toronto",
    "AssociatedCities": "Ajax, Whitby, Toronto, Mississauga, Brampton",
    "Province": "ON",
    "Status": 1
  },
  {
    "SearchCity": "Vancouver",
    "AssociatedCities": "Vancouver, Vancouver City",
    "Province": "BC",
    "Status": 1
  }
]
```

The issue you're facing is related to the way ASP.NET Core's JSON serializer works. It only serializes properties, not fields. In your `City` class, you've defined `CityName`, `AssociatedCities`, `Province`, and `Status` as fields, not properties. 

To resolve this issue, you should change these fields to properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In C#, properties are defined with `{ get; set; }` syntax, which creates a getter and a setter method for the property. These methods are used to retrieve and update the value of the property, respectively. 

After making these changes, your API should return the expected JSON response.

The issue you're facing is because the properties in your `City` class are defined as fields, not properties. The JSON serializer in ASP.NET Core will not serialize fields, it only serializes properties.

You can resolve this issue by changing the fields in your `City` class to properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In C#, properties are defined with `{ get; set; }` syntax. This allows you to get or set the value of the property. 

After making these changes, your API should return the expected JSON response.

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the properties in your `City` class are defined as fields, not properties. The JSON serializer in .NET Core does not serialize fields, it only serializes properties. 

You can resolve this issue by converting your fields into properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In this code, I've added `{ get; set; }` to each field, converting them into properties. Now, when you return a list of `City` objects from your API, the JSON serializer will include the properties in the serialized JSON.
