I have disabled Browser Link inside Visual Studio 2022, and I have also disabled all the Hot Reload functionality.

Even the Browser Link Dashboard indicates it should be disabled:

I also  any of the `app.UseBrowserLink();` code anywhere in my code. (as documented in [Browser Link in ASP.NET Core](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/using-browserlink?view=aspnetcore-6.0).
However, these middlewares still somehow appear in the request pipeline:
- `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Watch.BrowserRefresh.BrowserRefreshMiddleware`- `Microsoft.WebTools.BrowserLink.Net.BrowserLinkMiddleware`
These middlewares add this to my HTML:
```
<!-- Visual Studio Browser Link -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://localhost:44399/0928d478a97d441187231f2a1a7cd5e5/browserLink" async="async" id="__browserLink_initializationData" data-requestId="c94cf93088fb44e98f4e499b20ad7bfe" data-requestMappingFromServer="False"></script>
<!-- End Browser Link -->

<script src="/_framework/aspnetcore-browser-refresh.js"></script></body>
```

And every time I save a file, it reloads the browser. I want to stop this behaviour, and I ran out of options how.
Is this something that the IIS Express or Visual Studio add automatically?
I also checked all the packages and DLLs, and I don't see it included anywhere in my code. It must be included automatically via some "magic" that Visual Studio 2022 does.

The behavior you're experiencing is likely due to the new Hot Reload feature in .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022. This feature is designed to improve the development experience by automatically refreshing your application when changes are made to the code.

If you want to disable this feature, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Go to `Tools` > `Options` in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to `Projects and Solutions` > `.NET Hot Reload`.
3. Uncheck the box that says `Enable .NET Hot Reload on file save`.
4. Click `OK` to save your changes.

This should prevent Visual Studio from automatically refreshing your application when you save changes to your code.

If you're still experiencing the issue after following these steps, it's possible that there's a bug or some other issue causing the behavior. In that case, you might want to consider reporting the issue to Microsoft through the Visual Studio feedback tool.

The behavior you're experiencing seems to be related to the new Hot Reload feature in .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022. Even though you've disabled Browser Link, the Hot Reload feature might still be active.

Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Disable Hot Reload in Visual Studio 2022:**

   - Go to `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > ASP.NET Core`
   - Uncheck the `Enable .NET Hot Reload on file save` option

2. **Disable Hot Reload in launchSettings.json:**

   - Open the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in your project
   - Under the `iisSettings` section, add `"hotReloadProfile": "Off"` to the `iisExpress` profile

Here's an example:

```json
"iisSettings": {
  "windowsAuthentication": false,
  "anonymousAuthentication": true,
  "iisExpress": {
    "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:12345",
    "sslPort": 0,
    "hotReloadProfile": "Off"
  }
}
```

3. **Disable Hot Reload in the .csproj file:**

   - Open your .csproj file
   - Add the following PropertyGroup:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <DisableHotReload>true</DisableHotReload>
</PropertyGroup>
```

After making these changes, restart Visual Studio and run your project again. The Hot Reload feature should be disabled, and the scripts should no longer be injected into your HTML.

If the issue persists, it might be a bug in Visual Studio 2022 or .NET 6. In that case, you might want to report it to Microsoft via the Visual Studio Feedback tool.

The behavior you're experiencing is indeed related to Visual Studio 2022's automatic integration with ASP.NET Core development. The "magic" you're referring to is the automatic injection of middleware into your application's pipeline when running in the development environment.

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Watch.BrowserRefresh.BrowserRefreshMiddleware` and `Microsoft.WebTools.BrowserLink.Net.BrowserLinkMiddleware` middlewares are added by Visual Studio and IIS Express to enable features like Browser Link and Hot Reload.

To disable this behavior, you can try the following steps:

1. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in Visual Studio Options:**
   - Go to `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > ASP.NET Core`.
   - Uncheck the `Enable Browser Link` and `Enable Hot Reload` options.

2. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in launchSettings.json:**
   - Open the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in your project.
   - In the `iisSettings` section, set `windowsAuthentication`, `anonymousAuthentication`, and `enableBrowserLink` to `false`.
   - In the profiles section for your project, set `launchBrowser` to `false`.

Here's an example of how your `launchSettings.json` file might look:

```json
{
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": false,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:12345",
      "sslPort": 0
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "YourProjectName": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:54321"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in your Startup.cs:**
   - In your `Startup.cs` file, remove or comment out any calls to `app.UseBrowserLink()`.

After making these changes, you should restart Visual Studio and your web server to ensure the changes take effect. If you're still experiencing the issue, it might be a bug in Visual Studio 2022, and you should consider reporting it to Microsoft.
