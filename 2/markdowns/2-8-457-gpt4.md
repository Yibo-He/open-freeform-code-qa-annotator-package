I found a topic that encounter the same problem ([Can't debug Golang in vscode apple m1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/67637872/cant-debug-golang-in-vscode-apple-m1)) but I'm not sure it's an old solution or not because I'm using the Go version
```
go1.17.1 darwin/arm64
```

with
```
dlv version 1.7.2
```

and
```
VSCode version 1.60.2 (arm64)
```

on
```
Mac M1 BigSur (11.6)
```

when I run debug (`fn+f5`) a Debug console shows:
```
Starting: /Users/username/go/bin/dlv-dap dap --check-go-version=false --listen=127.0.0.1:53115 --log-dest=3 from /Users/username/go/src/project-name
DAP server listening at: 127.0.0.1:53115
```

and there is a Pop-up error:
```
Failed to launch: could not launch process: can not run under Rosetta, check that the installed build of Go is right for your CPU architecture
```

I have tried downgrade go version to 1.16.8 arm64 with dlv 1.6.1 but still got the same error.
I can use go build successfully on both versions.

The error message you're seeing suggests that the Go debugger (dlv) is trying to run under Rosetta, which is Apple's technology for translating software compiled for Intel processors to run on Apple Silicon. However, dlv cannot run under Rosetta.

This issue might be due to the Go extension for VSCode not being fully compatible with Apple M1 chips yet. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the Go and dlv binaries you're using are the correct ones for your architecture. You can check this by running `which go` and `which dlv` in your terminal. The output should point to the arm64 versions of these binaries.

2. **Check your Go extension settings in VSCode**: Make sure that the "Use Language Server" option is checked. You can find this in the settings (Code > Preferences > Settings > Extensions > Go).

3. **Update your Go extension for VSCode**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the Go extension for VSCode. You can check for updates in the Extensions view in VSCode.

4. **Try using the beta version of the Go extension**: The Go team at Google has a beta version of the Go extension for VSCode that includes better support for Apple M1 chips. You can install it by searching for "gopls" in the Extensions view in VSCode.

5. **Try using a different IDE or editor**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to try using a different IDE or editor that has better support for Go on Apple M1 chips. JetBrains' GoLand is one such option.

Remember to restart VSCode after making these changes to ensure they take effect.

The error message you're seeing suggests that the Go debugger (dlv) is trying to run under Rosetta, which is a translation process that allows software compiled for Intel processors to run on Apple's M1 chips. However, dlv doesn't support running under Rosetta.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Go and dlv installations**: Make sure that both Go and dlv are installed natively for the arm64 architecture, not the amd64 architecture. You can check this by running `go env GOARCH` and `file $(which dlv)`. The output should be `arm64` for both commands.

2. **Reinstall Go and dlv**: If the above step reveals that either Go or dlv is not installed for the correct architecture, you should reinstall them. You can download the arm64 version of Go from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/). After installing Go, you can reinstall dlv by running `go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest`.

3. **Check your VSCode installation**: Make sure that you're running the arm64 version of VSCode, not the amd64 version. You can check this by going to `Code > About Visual Studio Code` in the VSCode menu. If you're running the amd64 version, you should download and install the arm64 version from the [official VSCode website](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

4. **Update your launch configuration**: In your `.vscode/launch.json` file, try adding `"runtimeArgs": ["--check-go-version=false"]` to your launch configuration. This will tell dlv to skip the Go version check, which might be causing the issue.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, it might be a bug in dlv or VSCode. In that case, I would recommend reporting the issue on the [dlv GitHub page](https://github.com/go-delve/delve/issues) or the [VSCode GitHub page](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-go/issues).

The error message you're seeing suggests that the Go debugger (dlv) is trying to run under Rosetta, which is Apple's technology for translating apps built for Intel processors to run on Apple Silicon. However, dlv cannot run under Rosetta.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Go PATH**: Make sure that your Go PATH is correctly set to the arm64 version of Go. You can check this by running `go env` in your terminal and looking at the `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` values. They should point to the arm64 version of Go.

2. **Reinstall dlv**: Try reinstalling dlv using the following command: `GOARCH=arm64 go install github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv@latest`. This will ensure that you're installing the arm64 version of dlv.

3. **Check your VSCode settings**: Make sure that your VSCode is correctly configured to use the arm64 version of Go and dlv. You can check this by going to the settings (File > Preferences > Settings) and searching for "Go". Make sure that the "Go: Goroot" and "Go: Gopath" settings are correctly set to the arm64 version of Go.

4. **Try using the Go Nightly build**: Some users have reported that using the Go Nightly build can resolve this issue. You can install it by going to the Extensions view in VSCode (View > Extensions), searching for "Go Nightly", and clicking Install.

5. **Update your system and software**: Make sure that your macOS, Go, dlv, and VSCode are all up-to-date. Apple, the Go team, and the VSCode team are all actively working on improving support for Apple Silicon, so updating your software might resolve this issue.

If none of these solutions work, I would recommend asking for help on the Go community forums or on the GitHub pages for Go and dlv. This seems to be a common issue with Go on Apple Silicon, so they might be able to provide more specific assistance.
