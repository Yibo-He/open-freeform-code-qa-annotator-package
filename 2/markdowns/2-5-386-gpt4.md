since .jar is not anymore the best format to use to distribute our JavaFX project, I'm willing to use the tool JPackage for that instead, but after reading this post : [https://stackoverflow.com/a/68823040/4262407](https://stackoverflow.com/a/68823040/4262407), I ended up having multiple questions, but first of all, I just wanna make sure I ve well understood the process that I should follow :
the process :
1-create a modular project
2-package the project in a .jar format
3-use the tool Jlink to create a customized run-time image (to reduce the size of the output)
4-use the tool jpackage (it takes 2 and 3 as inputs)
I'm also wondering if I can rely on Intellij artifacts to create the .jar file (the 2 step) is it better to use a specific plugin ?
The last thing that is not clear is do we need to include the dependencies in the .jar file ? since I believe they will be included in the customized run time, won't they?

Yes, you've got the basic process correct. Here's a bit more detail:

1. Create a modular project: This means that you need to define a `module-info.java` file in your project where you specify which packages your module exports and which other modules it requires.

2. Package the project in a .jar format: This is where you compile your code and package it into a JAR file. You can definitely use IntelliJ's built-in artifact generation to create the JAR file. However, if your project has a complex structure or many dependencies, you might want to consider using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, which can handle this process more efficiently.

3. Use the tool Jlink to create a customized run-time image: This is an optional step, but it can help reduce the size of your application by including only the necessary parts of the Java runtime. 

4. Use the tool jpackage: This tool takes as input the JAR file and the custom runtime image (if you created one), and packages them into a native application bundle (like an .exe on Windows, .dmg on macOS, or .deb on Linux).

As for your question about dependencies, it depends on how you're building your JAR file. If you're using a tool like Maven or Gradle, you can configure it to include all your dependencies inside the JAR file (this is known as a "fat JAR" or "uber JAR"). However, if you're using jlink to create a custom runtime image, then you don't need to include your dependencies in the JAR file, because jlink will include them in the runtime image. 

Remember that jlink can only include modules that are modular (i.e., they have a `module-info.java` file), so if you have dependencies that are not modular, you'll need to include them in your JAR file.

Yes, you have understood the process correctly. Here's a bit more detail:

1. Create a modular project: This means that your project should be organized into modules, with a `module-info.java` file at the root of each module's source directory. This file defines the module's name, the modules it requires, and the packages it exports.

2. Package the project in a .jar format: This is the process of bundling your compiled code into a JAR file. This JAR file should include the `module-info.class` files generated from your `module-info.java` files.

3. Use the tool Jlink to create a customized run-time image: Jlink is a tool that can assemble and optimize a set of modules and their dependencies into a custom run-time image. This image will only include the modules that your project actually needs, which can significantly reduce its size.

4. Use the tool jpackage: This tool takes as input a JAR file and a custom run-time image (created by Jlink), and generates a platform-specific package (like an .exe or .dmg file) that can be distributed and installed on end-user machines.

As for your question about IntelliJ artifacts, yes, you can use IntelliJ to create the JAR file. IntelliJ has built-in support for creating JAR artifacts, and it can also handle the creation of the `module-info.class` files. However, you may also want to consider using a build tool like Maven or Gradle, which can automate the process of compiling, testing, and packaging your code.

Regarding dependencies, they do not need to be included in the JAR file if they are included in the custom run-time image. When you use Jlink to create the run-time image, it will include all the modules that your project depends on, so there's no need to duplicate them in the JAR file. However, if your project has any non-modular dependencies (i.e., libraries that don't have a `module-info.java` file), you will need to include them in the JAR file, because Jlink can only work with modular JARs.

Yes, you've got the process mostly correct. Here's a bit more detail:

1. Create a modular project: This means your project should have a `module-info.java` file that describes the modules it requires and the packages it exports.

2. Package the project in a .jar format: This is the standard way to distribute Java applications. You can use IntelliJ's built-in artifact creation tool to create the .jar file, or you can use a build tool like Maven or Gradle, which might be more flexible and powerful.

3. Use the tool Jlink to create a customized run-time image: This step is optional, but it can significantly reduce the size of your application by including only the necessary parts of the Java runtime.

4. Use the tool jpackage: This tool takes the .jar file and the custom runtime image (if you created one) and packages them into a native application bundle (like an .exe file on Windows, .dmg on macOS, or .deb on Linux).

As for your question about dependencies, it depends on how you're building your .jar file. If you're using a tool like Maven or Gradle, you can configure it to include all dependencies in the .jar file (this is called a "fat jar" or "uber jar"). If you're using IntelliJ's artifact creation tool, you'll need to manually add all necessary libraries to the artifact.

However, when you create a custom runtime image with Jlink, it only includes the modules that are required by your application, not the entire Java runtime. So if your application depends on libraries that are not part of the Java runtime, you'll need to include them in your .jar file.

In summary, you should include all dependencies in your .jar file, unless they are part of the Java runtime and you're creating a custom runtime image with Jlink.
