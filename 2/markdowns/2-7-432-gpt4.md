I run the  command and I will explain step by step what I do after that to understand the scenario,

The thing is, these kinds of scenarios may arise, and I don't want to see this error message, just logout after clicking logout, even if the session is expired.

It seems like you're dealing with a situation where you want to handle session expiration gracefully, specifically when a user clicks on the logout button. Here's a general step-by-step process of how you can handle this:

1. **User Clicks Logout**: The first step is triggered when the user clicks the logout button. This sends a request to the server to end the session.

2. **Check Session Validity**: Before processing the logout request, the server checks if the session is still valid. This is usually done by checking a session ID or token that was issued when the user logged in.

3. **Session Expired**: If the session has already expired (either due to inactivity or because it was manually ended), the server will typically return an error message. This is what you're trying to avoid.

4. **Handle Session Expiration Gracefully**: Instead of returning an error when the session is already expired, you can modify your server-side code to simply return a successful logout response. This way, from the user's perspective, they were logged out successfully, whether their session was already expired or not.

5. **Client-Side Handling**: On the client side, when the logout request is made, you can handle the response from the server. If it's a success message (which it will always be with the above modification), you can redirect the user to the login page or a confirmation page that they've been logged out.

6. **Clear Client-Side Session Data**: As an additional step, you may want to clear any session data stored on the client side (like in cookies or local storage) when the logout button is clicked, regardless of whether the session on the server is expired or not.

Remember, the specifics of this process may vary depending on the programming language and framework you're using.

It seems like you're dealing with a session management issue. Here's a general step-by-step process to handle this:

1. **Run the Command**: You didn't specify the command you're running, but I assume it's related to logging out a user. This could be a command to delete a session, or a command to log out a user in a web application.

2. **Check Session Validity**: Before executing the logout command, check if the session is still valid. This can be done by checking the session's expiry time against the current time.

3. **Execute Logout**: If the session is valid, execute the logout command. This could involve deleting the session data, or sending a command to the server to log out the user.

4. **Handle Expired Sessions**: If the session is already expired, you should handle this gracefully. Instead of showing an error message, you can simply redirect the user to the login page, or show a message saying "Session expired, please login again". This can be done in the error handling part of your code.

5. **Test**: Finally, test your code to make sure it works as expected. Try logging out with both valid and expired sessions, and make sure the correct behavior happens in each case.

Remember, the exact steps and code will depend on the programming language and framework you're using. If you provide more specific details, I can give a more tailored answer.

It seems like you want to handle session expiration gracefully in your application. Here's a general step-by-step guide on how you can achieve this:

1. **Detect Session Expiration**: The first step is to detect when the session has expired. This can be done by setting a timeout when the session is created, and then checking the current time against this timeout whenever a request is made.

2. **Handle Session Expiration**: Once you've detected that the session has expired, you need to handle this in your code. This could be done in a number of ways, depending on your application. For example, you could redirect the user to a login page, or you could display a message informing them that their session has expired.

3. **Logout Functionality**: When the user clicks the logout button, you should invalidate the session on the server side. This means that even if the session has already expired, clicking logout will still work as expected.

4. **Error Handling**: To prevent the error message from being displayed, you need to handle this in your code. This could be done by catching the exception that is thrown when the session has expired, and then handling it appropriately.

5. **Testing**: Finally, you should test your code to ensure that it works as expected. This could involve creating a session, waiting for it to expire, and then trying to logout.

Remember, the exact implementation of these steps will depend on the programming language and framework that you're using.
