I'm trying to write middleware for user authorization in my app. I use this function to check if a route requires being sign in.
The code is as follows:
```
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt'); 

exports.requireSignin = expressJwt({
secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
algorithms: ["HS256"],
userProperty: "auth",});
```

However, I get the following error:
```
TypeError: expressJwt is not a function at Object.<anonymous> (path to the file)\
```

What could be the problem? None of the other answers seem to be helpful.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function, which means it's not being imported correctly. 

In your code, you're using destructuring assignment to import `expressJwt` from the `express-jwt` module. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with properties. 

So, you should change your import statement from:

```javascript
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt');
```

to:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This should resolve the TypeError you're encountering.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function. This is likely because of how you're importing the `express-jwt` module. 

In your code, you're destructuring `expressJwt` from `require('express-jwt')`, which implies that `express-jwt` exports an object with a property `expressJwt` that is a function. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with a property that is a function.

So, you should change your import to this:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This way, `expressJwt` will correctly be a function that you can call.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function. This is likely because of how you're importing it.

You're using destructuring assignment to import `expressJwt`:

```javascript
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt');
```

This would work if `express-jwt` exported an object with a property named `expressJwt`. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with properties.

You should import `expressJwt` like this:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This way, you're assigning the function exported by `express-jwt` directly to the `expressJwt` variable.
