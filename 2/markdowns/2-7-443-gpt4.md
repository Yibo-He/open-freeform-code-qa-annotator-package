I wanted to pass a value of typed `array` to my route parameter, the array could be in any size and a different key-value pairs each time.
```
Route::get('/example/{array}', ...
```

So if I have an array like this:
```
$array = [
  'a' => 'one',
  'b' => 1,
  ...
]
```

I did this but knew already it ain't gonna work because it looks like I'm passing values to my route parameters named `a`, `b`, etc.
```
route('route.name', $array)
```

As expected the error says:
> ... [Missing parameter: array]
So I used the `serialize()`.
```
route('route.name', serialize($array))
```

I'm still getting an error, something like:
> [Missing parameter: s:1:"a";i:1;s:1:"b";i:2;]
What am I missing ? I also don't understand what the last error says.

The error message you're seeing is the serialized version of your array. The `serialize()` function in PHP generates a storable representation of a value. This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their type and structure. 

However, Laravel's route parameters are not designed to accept arrays directly. They are designed to accept simple scalar types like strings or integers. 

If you want to pass an array to a route, you can convert the array to a query string and append it to the URL. Here's an example:

```php
$array = ['a' => 'one', 'b' => 1];
$queryString = http_build_query($array);
$url = route('route.name') . '?' . $queryString;
```

Then, in your controller, you can retrieve these values using the `request()` helper or `Request` facade:

```php
$array = request()->all(); // This will give you all the query parameters as an array
```

This method will work for arrays of any size and with different key-value pairs each time. However, be aware that there is a limit to the length of a URL, so if your array is very large, you may run into issues. 

If you have a very large array, you might want to consider a different approach, such as storing the array in the session or database and passing the ID to the route.

The problem you're facing is due to the fact that Laravel's routing system doesn't support passing arrays as route parameters out of the box. The route parameters are expected to be simple scalar values like strings or integers.

The error message you're seeing is because `serialize()` function in PHP returns a string containing a byte-stream representation of any value that can be stored in PHP. Laravel is trying to match this serialized string to a route parameter and failing.

If you need to pass an array to a route, you can consider these options:

1. **Convert the array to a query string**: You can convert your array to a query string and append it to your URL. Laravel provides a helper function `http_build_query()` to do this. Here's an example:

```php
$array = ['a' => 'one', 'b' => 1];
$queryString = http_build_query($array);
$url = route('route.name') . '?' . $queryString;
```

Then in your controller, you can access these values using the `request()` helper or `Request` facade:

```php
$a = request('a'); // 'one'
$b = request('b'); // 1
```

2. **JSON encode the array**: Another option is to JSON encode the array and pass it as a single string parameter. However, you'll need to decode it in your controller:

```php
$array = ['a' => 'one', 'b' => 1];
$url = route('route.name', ['array' => json_encode($array)]);
```

Then in your controller, you can decode this value:

```php
$array = json_decode($array, true);
```

Remember, both these methods have limitations. If your array is very large, you might exceed the maximum URL length of browsers and servers. Also, these methods expose your array data in the URL, which might not be desirable for sensitive data.

The issue you're facing is due to the way Laravel handles route parameters. When you define a route with a parameter, Laravel expects a single value for that parameter. When you try to pass an array, Laravel can't handle it because it's expecting a single value, not a collection of values.

The `serialize()` function in PHP generates a storable representation of a value. This is useful for storing or passing PHP values around without losing their type and structure. However, Laravel's routing system doesn't understand this serialized string as a valid parameter.

If you want to pass an array to a route, you have a few options:

1. **Convert the array to a query string**: You can convert the array to a query string and append it to the URL. This way, you can access the values in your controller using the `request()` helper or `Request` facade.

```php
$queryString = http_build_query($array);
$url = route('route.name') . '?' . $queryString;
```

In your controller, you can access the values like this:

```php
$valueA = request('a');
$valueB = request('b');
```

2. **Pass the array as a single encoded string**: You can encode the array into a JSON string and pass it as a single parameter. In your controller, you can then decode the string back into an array.

```php
$json = json_encode($array);
$url = route('route.name', ['array' => $json]);
```

In your controller, you can decode the string like this:

```php
$array = json_decode($array, true);
```

Remember that both of these methods have limitations. If your array is very large, you might exceed the maximum URL length. Also, since the data is in the URL, it's visible to the user and can be manipulated by them. If you need to pass sensitive data or large amounts of data, consider using a POST request instead.
