I'm learning Golang and as an exercise in using interfaces I'm building a toy program. I'm having some problem trying to use a type that "should implement" two interfaces - one way to solve that in C++ and Java would be to use inheritance(there are other techniques, but I think that is the most common). As I lack that mechanism in Golang, I'm not sure how to proceed about it. Below is the code:
```
var (
    faces = []string{"Ace", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Jack", "Queen", "King"}

    suits = []string{"Hearts", "Diamonds", "Spades", "Clubs"}
)

type Card interface {
    GetFace() string
    GetSuit() string
}

type card struct {
    cardNum int
    face    string
    suit    string
}

func NewCard(num int) Card {
    newCard := card{
        cardNum: num,
        face:    faces[num%len(faces)],
        suit:    suits[num/len(faces)],
    }

    return &newCard
}

func (c *card) GetFace() string {
    return c.face
}

func (c *card) GetSuit() string {
    return c.suit
}

func (c *card) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s%s ", c.GetFace(), c.GetSuit())
}
```

What I'm trying to achieve:
- - 
The problem comes when I'm trying to use a new card though the "Card" interface and also trying to get the string representation. I cannot pass the interface as the parameter of the implementation of the  method as there is a compiler error which is related to the addressability of an interface at the core language level(still digging through that documentation). The very simple example of testing exposes the issue:
```
func TestString(t *testing.T) {
    card := NewCard(0)
    assert.EqualValues(t, "AceHearts ", card.String(), " newly created card's string repr should be 'AceHearts '")
}
```

The compiler tells me, for good reason, that . I could just add the  method to my  interface, but I do not find that to be clean: I have other entities implemented with the same model and I would have to add that redundancy everywhere; there is already an interface with that method.
What would be a good solution for the above issue that I'm having?
(to address some of the very good comments)

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

One solution to this problem is to create a new interface that embeds the `Card` interface and adds the `String()` method. This new interface can be used wherever both `Card` and `String()` are needed. Here's an example:

```
type Stringer interface {
    Card
    String() string
}

func NewStringer(num int) Stringer {
    return &card{
        cardNum: num,
        face:    faces[num%len(faces)],
        suit:    suits[num/len(faces)],
    }
}
```

Now, you can create a new `Stringer` using `NewStringer()` and use it wherever both `Card` and `String()` are needed. For example:

```
func TestString(t *testing.T) {
    card := NewStringer(0)
    assert.EqualValues(t, "AceHearts ", card.String(), " newly created card's string repr should be 'AceHearts '")
}
```

This approach allows you to reuse the `Card` interface and avoid redundancy while still providing the `String()` method where needed.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

One solution to this problem is to create a new interface that embeds the `Card` interface and adds the `String()` method. This way, any type that implements the `Card` interface will also implement the new interface and have the `String()` method available.

Here's an example of how you can define the new interface:

```
type Stringer interface {
    Card
    String() string
}
```

Now, you can modify your `card` struct to implement this new interface:

```
type card struct {
    cardNum int
    face    string
    suit    string
}

func NewCard(num int) Stringer {
    newCard := card{
        cardNum: num,
        face:    faces[num%len(faces)],
        suit:    suits[num/len(faces)],
    }

    return &newCard
}

func (c *card) GetFace() string {
    return c.face
}

func (c *card) GetSuit() string {
    return c.suit
}

func (c *card) String() string {
    return fmt.Sprintf("%s%s ", c.GetFace(), c.GetSuit())
}
```

Now, you can use the `String()` method on any type that implements the `Stringer` interface, including the `card` type returned by `NewCard()`.

```
func TestString(t *testing.T) {
    card := NewCard(0)
    assert.EqualValues(t, "AceHearts ", card.String(), " newly created card's string repr should be 'AceHearts '")
}
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

One solution to this problem is to create a new interface that embeds the `Card` interface and adds the `String()` method. This new interface can be used wherever you need to call the `String()` method on a `Card` object. Here's an example:

```
type Stringer interface {
    Card
    String() string
}

func NewCard(num int) Stringer {
    newCard := card{
        cardNum: num,
        face:    faces[num%len(faces)],
        suit:    suits[num/len(faces)],
    }

    return &newCard
}

func TestString(t *testing.T) {
    card := NewCard(0)
    assert.EqualValues(t, "AceHearts ", card.String(), " newly created card's string repr should be 'AceHearts '")
}
```

In this example, we've created a new interface called `Stringer` that embeds the `Card` interface and adds the `String()` method. We've also updated the `NewCard()` function to return a `Stringer` instead of a `Card`. Now, when we create a new card and call the `String()` method on it, it will work as expected.

By creating a new interface that embeds the `Card` interface, we avoid duplicating the `GetFace()` and `GetSuit()` methods in multiple interfaces. This approach also allows us to add additional methods to the `Stringer` interface if needed in the future.
