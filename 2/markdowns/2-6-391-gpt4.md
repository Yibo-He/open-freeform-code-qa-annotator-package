I have a .NET microservice running as a docker container that is responsible for sending emails to customers. These emails contains additional banner which is a png file.
Should that file be included in my Docker Image during build process? Is it a good practise at all?
Is it a better approach to upload the file to an already built container or linked the file stored in different place?
Dockerfile
```
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:5.0-buster-slim AS base

WORKDIR /app

EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:5.0-buster-slim AS build

WORKDIR /src

COPY src/Email.Service/Email.Service.csproj .
COPY nuget.config .

RUN dotnet restore Email.Service.csproj --configfile nuget.config

COPY src/Email.Service .

RUN dotnet build Email.Service.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM build AS publish

RUN dotnet publish Email.Service.csproj -c Release -o /app

FROM base AS final

WORKDIR /app

COPY --from=publish /app .

COPY src/Email.Service/Assets Assets

ENTRYPOINT [ "dotnet" ]
CMD [ "Email.Service.dll" ]
```

banner.png lives in Assets directory in the project.

Including static files like images in your Docker image during the build process is a common practice and it's perfectly fine to do so. This is especially true for small files that are unlikely to change often, as it simplifies the deployment process and ensures that the necessary files are always available to your application.

In your case, including the `banner.png` file in the Docker image makes sense, as it's used by the email service and needs to be available whenever the service is running. Your Dockerfile already includes the necessary command to copy the Assets directory (which contains the `banner.png` file) into the Docker image:

```dockerfile
COPY src/Email.Service/Assets Assets
```

This command will copy the entire Assets directory from your project into the Docker image. When your application runs, it will be able to access the `banner.png` file from the Assets directory.

However, if the image file is large or changes frequently, you might want to consider other options. For example, you could store the image in a cloud storage service (like AWS S3 or Azure Blob Storage) and download it when needed. This would keep your Docker image small and allow you to update the image without rebuilding the Docker image. But this adds complexity to your application and might not be necessary if the image file is small and doesn't change often.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Including the banner image in your Docker image during the build process is a good practice if the image is not expected to change frequently. This is because every time the image changes, you would need to rebuild and redeploy the Docker image. 

In your case, if the banner image is static and does not change often, it makes sense to include it in the Docker image. This way, the image contains everything it needs to run the microservice, making it portable and self-contained. 

Your Dockerfile already includes the necessary command to copy the Assets directory (which contains the banner image) into the Docker image:

```COPY src/Email.Service/Assets Assets```

This command copies the Assets directory from your local machine into the Docker image. 

If the banner image changes frequently, another approach would be to store the image in a cloud storage service (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) and have your microservice download it when needed. This way, you wouldn't need to rebuild and redeploy the Docker image every time the image changes. However, this approach introduces additional complexity and potential points of failure into your system (e.g., the microservice needs to be able to handle the case where it can't download the image). 

In conclusion, whether to include the image in the Docker image or not depends on how often the image changes and the trade-offs you're willing to make between simplicity and flexibility.

Yes, it is a good practice to include static files like images, which are required by your application, in your Docker image during the build process. This ensures that the image contains everything it needs to run the application, making it portable and self-contained.

In your Dockerfile, you are already copying the Assets directory (which contains the banner.png file) into the Docker image. This is the correct approach.

Uploading the file to an already built container is not a good practice because it breaks the portability of your Docker image. If you move the container to a different host, you would have to remember to also move the file.

Linking the file from a different place (like a network share or a cloud storage bucket) could be a good solution if the file changes frequently and you want to avoid rebuilding the Docker image every time. However, this introduces an external dependency to your application. If the network share or cloud storage bucket is not available, your application will not be able to send the emails with the banner. 

In conclusion, if the banner.png file does not change frequently, it is better to include it in the Docker image. If it changes frequently, you might want to consider storing it in a place that your application can access at runtime, but be aware of the potential issues with this approach.
