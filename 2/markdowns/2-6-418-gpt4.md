I believe that C# stops evaluating an if statement condition as soon as it is able to tell the outcome. So for example:
```
if ( (1 < 0) && check_something_else() )
    // this will not be called
```

Since the condition `(1 < 0)` evaluates as `false`, the `&&` condition cannot be met, and `check_something_else()` will not be called.
How does C# evaluate an if statement with asynchronous functions? Does it wait for both to return? So for example:
```
if( await first_check() && await second_check() )
    // ???
```

Will this ever be short-circuited?

In C#, the `&&` operator is a short-circuit operator, meaning if the first condition is `false`, it won't evaluate the second condition. However, in the case of `await` in an `if` statement, both `await` calls will be executed because the `await` keyword will cause the method to pause and wait for the task to complete.

So in your example:
```csharp
if( await first_check() && await second_check() )
    // ???
```
Both `first_check()` and `second_check()` will be awaited, regardless of the result of `first_check()`. This is because the `await` keyword causes the method to pause and wait for the task to complete, so `first_check()` has to complete before `second_check()` can even start.

If you want to short-circuit the evaluation, you can do something like this:
```csharp
if (await first_check() && await second_check())
    // ???
```
This will only call `second_check()` if `first_check()` returns `true`.

This is because the `&&` operator is short-circuiting, so if the first operand is `false`, the second operand is not evaluated. However, because you're using `await`, the first task has to complete before the second one can start.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

In C#, the `&&` operator is a short-circuit operator, meaning that if the first condition is `false`, the second condition will not be evaluated. This is true even when using `await` in the conditions.

However, the way you've written your `if` statement with `await` in each condition is not valid in C#. The `await` keyword can only be used with a task, and the `&&` operator cannot be applied to two tasks. 

If you want to use `await` in an `if` statement with two conditions, you would need to await each task separately before the `if` statement, like this:

```csharp
bool firstCheck = await first_check();
bool secondCheck = await second_check();

if(firstCheck && secondCheck)
    // do something
```

In this case, both `first_check()` and `second_check()` will be awaited before the `if` statement is evaluated, regardless of the results of the checks. This means that the short-circuit behavior of the `&&` operator does not apply in this case, because both tasks are awaited before the `if` statement.

If you want to take advantage of the short-circuit behavior with asynchronous methods, you would need to structure your code like this:

```csharp
if(await first_check() && await second_check())
    // do something
```

In this case, if `first_check()` returns `false`, `second_check()` will not be awaited. This is because the `&&` operator short-circuits and does not evaluate the second condition if the first condition is `false`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Yes, C# will still short-circuit the evaluation of the `if` statement condition, even with `await` calls. However, the way it works with asynchronous methods is a bit different.

In your example:

```csharp
if( await first_check() && await second_check() )
    // ???
```

The `await first_check()` will always be executed because it's the first condition. If `first_check()` returns `false`, then `second_check()` will not be executed because the `&&` operator short-circuits and the overall condition cannot be `true`.

However, if `first_check()` returns `true`, then `second_check()` will be executed. This is because the `&&` operator needs to evaluate the second condition to determine the overall result.

So, in short, the `await` keyword doesn't change the short-circuit behavior of the `&&` operator. The second condition is only evaluated if the first condition is `true`.

It's important to note that the `await` keyword makes the method wait for the task to complete and then returns the result of the task. So, the `if` statement will not continue until `first_check()` has completed. If `first_check()` returns `true`, the `if` statement will then wait for `second_check()` to complete.
