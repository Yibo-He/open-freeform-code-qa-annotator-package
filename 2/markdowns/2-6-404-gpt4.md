How do I create  for a record type in C#?
I created a record type like this:
```
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
```

Now I want to introduce another constructor overload with no parameters, how can I do that?
In a normal class I would do something like this:
```
public class Person
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }

    public Person()
    {
        
    }

    public Person(int id, string firstName, string lastName)
    {
        Id = id;
        FirstName = firstName;
        LastName = lastName;
    }
}
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

In C# 9.0 and later, you can define additional constructors for a record type. However, these constructors must call the primary constructor (the one that matches the parameter list in the record declaration). Here's how you can add a parameterless constructor to your `Person` record:

```csharp
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
{
    public Person() : this(0, string.Empty, string.Empty) { }
}
```

In this code, the `Person()` constructor calls the primary constructor `Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)` with default values. This is necessary because in a record type, the compiler generates a primary constructor, and any additional constructors you define must call the primary constructor.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

In C# 9.0 and later, you can declare additional constructors for a record type. However, these constructors must call the primary constructor (the one that declares the properties). Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
{
    public Person() : this(0, string.Empty, string.Empty) { }
}
```

In this code, the `Person()` constructor calls the primary constructor `Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)` with default values. This is necessary because in a record type, the properties are readonly and can only be set in the primary constructor.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In C# 9.0 and later, you can define additional constructors for a record type. However, these constructors must call the primary constructor first. Here is how you can define a parameterless constructor for your `Person` record:

```csharp
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
{
    public Person() : this(0, string.Empty, string.Empty) { }
}
```

In this code, the `Person()` constructor calls the primary constructor `Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)` with default values. This is necessary because in a record type, the compiler generates a constructor with the same parameters as the record declaration (the primary constructor), and any additional constructors must call the primary constructor.
