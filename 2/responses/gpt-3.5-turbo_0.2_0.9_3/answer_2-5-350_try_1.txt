This error occurs when Gradle is unable to access a file due to exclusive access being held by another process. This can happen if another instance of Gradle is running or if the file is locked by another program.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Close any running instances of Gradle or VS Code.
2. Delete the `C:\Users\sanjay.gradle` directory.
3. Restart VS Code and try running the Flutter application again.

If the issue persists, you can try updating Gradle manually by downloading the latest version from the Gradle website and replacing the `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in your project's `gradle/wrapper` directory with the new version. 

You can also try running the command `flutter clean` to clear any cached files and then running the application again.

If none of these solutions work, you can try reinstalling Flutter and VS Code.
