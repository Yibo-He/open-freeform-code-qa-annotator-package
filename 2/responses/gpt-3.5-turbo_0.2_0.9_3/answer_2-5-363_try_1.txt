`@RequiredArgsConstructor` is a Lombok annotation that generates a constructor with parameters for all final fields in a class. This constructor can be used to create an instance of the class with all the required dependencies injected.

`@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))` is a variation of `@RequiredArgsConstructor` that also adds the `@Inject` annotation to the generated constructor. This is useful when using a dependency injection framework like Spring or Guice, as it allows the framework to automatically inject the required dependencies when creating an instance of the class.

In summary, the main difference between the two annotations is that `@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))` adds the `@Inject` annotation to the generated constructor, which can be useful when using a dependency injection framework.
