In IntelliJ IDEA, you can use the `print()` function to log data to the console. However, if you are using Flutter, you should use the `debugPrint()` function instead of `print()`. The `debugPrint()` function is specifically designed for Flutter and will print your data to the Flutter console.

Here's an example of how to use `debugPrint()`:

```dart
debugPrint('Hello, world!');
```

This will print "Hello, world!" to the Flutter console.

You can also use string interpolation to print variables:

```dart
String name = 'John';
int age = 30;
debugPrint('My name is $name and I am $age years old.');
```

This will print "My name is John and I am 30 years old." to the Flutter console.

Make sure that you have the Flutter console open in IntelliJ IDEA. You can open it by clicking on the "Flutter" tab at the bottom of the screen and then selecting "Console".
