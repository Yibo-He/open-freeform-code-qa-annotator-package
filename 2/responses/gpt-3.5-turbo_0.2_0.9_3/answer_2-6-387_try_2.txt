It seems like the error is related to the missing "Keys" table in your database. This table is used by IdentityServer4 to store signing keys.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the "Keys" table exists in your database. If it doesn't exist, you can create it by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Add-Migration AddKeysTable -Context YourDbContext
```

This will create a migration file that adds the "Keys" table to your database.

2. Apply the migration by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Update-Database -Context YourDbContext
```

This will apply the migration and create the "Keys" table in your database.

3. If the migration fails, you can try deleting the existing migration files and creating a new migration by running the following commands in the Package Manager Console:

```
Remove-Migration -Context YourDbContext
Add-Migration AddKeysTable -Context YourDbContext
Update-Database -Context YourDbContext
```

4. If the issue persists, you can try updating the IdentityServer4 package to the latest version and check if it resolves the issue.

Regarding the migration from .NET 5 to 6 for IdentityServer4, you can refer to the official documentation for upgrading IdentityServer4 to the latest version. It provides detailed information on the changes and migration steps required for upgrading to the latest version.
