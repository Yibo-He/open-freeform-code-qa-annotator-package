To get the current user's role who is logged in using Spatie/Roles in Laravel, you can use the `auth()->user()` method to get the authenticated user and then use the `hasRole()` method to check if the user has a specific role. Here's an example:

```
if(auth()->user()->hasRole('admin')) {
    // do something
}
```

Make sure that you have imported the `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles` trait in your User model and have assigned roles to your users using the `assignRole()` method.
