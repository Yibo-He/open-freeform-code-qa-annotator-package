This error occurs when the A.dll file is locked by another process, which in this case is Visual Studio. There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Close all instances of Visual Studio and try building the project again.
2. Check if any other application is using the A.dll file. If yes, close that application and try building the project again.
3. If the above solutions do not work, you can try deleting the bin folder manually and then rebuild the project. This will force Visual Studio to create a new bin folder and copy the required files to it.
4. Another solution is to use a tool like Process Explorer to find out which process is locking the A.dll file and then terminate that process. However, this solution is not recommended as it can cause data loss or other issues.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try repairing or reinstalling Visual Studio.
