Including the banner.png file in the Docker image during the build process is a good practice, as it ensures that the file is always available and consistent across all instances of the container. This also makes it easier to deploy the container to different environments without having to worry about missing files.

You can include the banner.png file in the Docker image by adding the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
COPY src/Email.Service/Assets/banner.png /app/Assets/banner.png
```

This will copy the banner.png file from the project directory to the /app/Assets directory in the Docker image.

Alternatively, you can store the banner.png file in a separate location and mount it as a volume when running the container. This approach allows you to update the file without having to rebuild the Docker image. To do this, you can use the -v option when running the container:

```
docker run -v /path/to/banner.png:/app/Assets/banner.png my-image
```

This will mount the banner.png file from the host machine to the /app/Assets directory in the container.
