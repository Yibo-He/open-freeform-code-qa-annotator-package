To download the artifacts generated by the latest build of a public Azure DevOps project, you can use the Azure DevOps REST API. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Get the latest build ID of the project by sending a GET request to the following URL:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/latest/{definitionId}?api-version=6.0
   ```

   Replace `{organization}` and `{project}` with the name of your organization and project, respectively. Replace `{definitionId}` with the ID of the build definition you want to get the latest build ID for.

   This API call will return a JSON response that contains the latest build ID.

2. Get the download URL for the artifacts of the latest build by sending a GET request to the following URL:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/builds/{buildId}/artifacts?api-version=6.0&%24format=zip
   ```

   Replace `{organization}` and `{project}` with the name of your organization and project, respectively. Replace `{buildId}` with the latest build ID obtained in step 1.

   This API call will return a download URL for the artifacts of the latest build in a ZIP format.

3. Use an `HttpClient` to download the ZIP file from the download URL obtained in step 2. Here's an example code snippet:

   ```csharp
   using (var httpClient = new HttpClient())
   {
       var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(downloadUrl);
       response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();

       using (var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync())
       {
           using (var fileStream = new FileStream("artifacts.zip", FileMode.Create))
           {
               await stream.CopyToAsync(fileStream);
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `downloadUrl` with the download URL obtained in step 2. This code will download the ZIP file and save it as `artifacts.zip` in the current directory.

That's it! You should now have the latest artifacts generated by the latest build of the Azure DevOps project downloaded to your local machine.
