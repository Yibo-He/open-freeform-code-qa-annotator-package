The error is occurring because you are trying to create an index on the `Gender` property of the `User` entity, which is actually a navigation property. Navigation properties are not supported as index properties in Entity Framework Core.

To fix the error, remove the following line from your `OnModelCreating` method:

```
user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);
```

If you need to create an index on the `GenderId` property, you can do so by adding the following line:

```
user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
```
