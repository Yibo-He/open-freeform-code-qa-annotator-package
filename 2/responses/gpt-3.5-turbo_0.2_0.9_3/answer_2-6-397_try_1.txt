It is possible that these middlewares are being added automatically by Visual Studio or IIS Express. One way to confirm this is to create a new ASP.NET Core project and see if these middlewares are present in the request pipeline by default.

To stop the behavior of the browser reloading every time you save a file, you can try disabling the Browser Refresh middleware. You can do this by removing the following line from your `Startup.cs` file:

```
app.UseBrowserRefresh();
```

If this line is not present in your `Startup.cs` file, you can try disabling the Browser Refresh middleware by adding the following line to your `appsettings.json` file:

```
{
  "Watch": {
    "BrowserRefreshEnabled": false
  }
}
```

This should disable the Browser Refresh middleware and stop the browser from reloading every time you save a file.
