The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you need to make sure you are using Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can check the version of Entity Framework Core you are using by looking at the version number of the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project's dependencies.

If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you can still create keyless entities by defining them as regular entities with no primary key and using the `HasNoKey()` method in the `OnModelCreating` method of your `DbContext`. For example:

```
public class MyKeylessClass
{
    public string Property1 { get; set; }
    public int Property2 { get; set; }
}

public class MyDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<MyKeylessClass> KeylessModel { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<MyKeylessClass>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

This will allow you to use `_context.KeylessModel.FromSqlRaw(...)` without having to add a primary key to your keyless entity.
