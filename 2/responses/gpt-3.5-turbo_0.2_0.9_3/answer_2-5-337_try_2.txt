In Android Studio or IntelliJ, you can use the "Extract Widget" refactoring shortcut to extract the Stack widget into a separate method. 

To do this, select the Stack widget code block and press "Ctrl + Alt + W" (Windows) or "Cmd + Alt + W" (Mac). This will open a dialog box where you can give a name to the new method and choose where to place it in your code. 

After you click "OK", Android Studio or IntelliJ will automatically create a new method with the selected code block and replace the original code with a call to the new method. 

This can help simplify your code and make it more readable and maintainable.
