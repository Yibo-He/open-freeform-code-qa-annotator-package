When C#8's nullability context is enabled, you need to explicitly mark the properties as nullable or non-nullable. In your case, you can mark the `ServiceUrl` property as non-nullable by adding the `!` symbol after the property type:

```
public string ServiceUrl { get; set; }!
```

This tells the compiler that the property is guaranteed to be non-null, and it will not generate the `CS8618` error.

Alternatively, you can initialize the property to a default value to avoid the error:

```
public string ServiceUrl { get; set; } = "";
```

This initializes the property to an empty string, which is a non-null value.

Note that if you mark a property as non-nullable, you must ensure that it is always initialized before it is used. Otherwise, you will get a runtime `NullReferenceException`.
