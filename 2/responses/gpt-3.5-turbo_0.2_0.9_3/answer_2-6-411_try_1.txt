If there is nothing to do in the synchronous Dispose() method, then you can leave it empty. The purpose of the synchronous Dispose() method is to provide a way for users of your class to release resources synchronously if they choose to do so. However, since you have no managed resources to release, there is no need to provide any logic in the Dispose() method. 

The asynchronous DisposeAsync() method is the primary method for releasing resources in your class, and the Dispose() method is just a convenience method. So, in your case, you can leave the Dispose() method empty and focus on implementing the asynchronous DisposeAsyncCore() method to perform the necessary clean-up.
