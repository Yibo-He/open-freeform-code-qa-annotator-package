The error message indicates that the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` is trying to import configuration from a ConfigServer, but it cannot find the `spring.config.import` property. This suggests that there might be some residual configuration from a previous version of the project that is causing this issue.

One possible solution is to explicitly disable the ConfigServer configuration by setting the `spring.cloud.config.enabled` property to `false`. You can do this by adding the following line to your `application.properties` file:

```
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```

Alternatively, you can try adding the `spring.config.import` property to your `application.properties` file with an empty value:

```
spring.config.import=
```

This should prevent the `ConfigServerConfigDataMissingEnvironmentPostProcessor` from trying to import configuration from a ConfigServer.

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to investigate further to determine if there are any other configuration issues that are causing this error.
