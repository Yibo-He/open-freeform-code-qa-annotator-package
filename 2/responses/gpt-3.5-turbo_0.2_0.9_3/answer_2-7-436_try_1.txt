The error message suggests that the version of PHP you are using is not compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. You can check your PHP version by running the command `php -v` in your terminal.

If you are using an older version of PHP, you will need to upgrade it to PHP 8.0 or higher. You can do this by following the instructions for your operating system.

Once you have upgraded your PHP version, you can try running the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command again. This should install Laravel 9 successfully.

If you still encounter issues, you can try running `composer clear-cache` and then running the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command again. This will clear any cached data that may be causing issues with the installation.
