The main benefit of using the @Configuration annotation is that it allows you to define beans and their dependencies explicitly in a separate class, rather than relying on component scanning to automatically detect and create beans based on annotations like @Service, @Controller, or @Repository.

By using @Configuration, you can define beans that have complex dependencies or require additional configuration, such as setting properties using the @Value annotation. You can also use the @Bean annotation to explicitly create and configure beans, rather than relying on the default behavior of component scanning.

Another benefit of using @Configuration is that it allows you to separate your configuration concerns from your business logic. This can make your code easier to understand and maintain, as well as making it easier to test your configuration separately from your application logic.

In summary, while it is possible to use @Service, @Controller, or @Repository annotations to define beans, using @Configuration provides more control over the creation and configuration of beans, as well as allowing you to separate your configuration concerns from your business logic.
