It seems like the issue is with the version of Java that you have installed. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or higher to run, and you currently have Java 8 installed.

You can download and install Java 11 or higher from the official Java website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html

Once you have installed Java 11 or higher, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the installation directory of Java 11 or higher. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under "System Variables", click on "New".
5. Enter "JAVA_HOME" as the variable name.
6. Enter the path to the installation directory of Java 11 or higher as the variable value (e.g. "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.11").
7. Click "OK" to save the changes.

After setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again and see if it works.
