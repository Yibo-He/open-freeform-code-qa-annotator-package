This error occurs when the Gradle version used in your project is not compatible with the Android Gradle Plugin version. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check the Gradle version used in your project. You can find it in the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file in the root directory of your project.

2. Check the latest version of the Android Gradle Plugin available. You can find it on the official Android Studio release notes page.

3. Update the Android Gradle Plugin version in your project's `build.gradle` file to the latest version.

4. If the latest version of the Android Gradle Plugin is not compatible with the Gradle version used in your project, you may need to update the Gradle version as well.

5. After updating the Android Gradle Plugin and/or Gradle version, try syncing your project again.

If the issue persists, you can try deleting the `.gradle` directory in your project's root directory and syncing the project again. This will force Gradle to download all dependencies again.
