The issue is that the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the first render, so when you try to assign the event handler to `tabSet.TabChanged`, `tabSet` is still null. 

To fix this, you can use the `OnInitialized` method to assign the event handler to `tabSet.TabChanged` instead of `OnAfterRenderAsync`. The `OnInitialized` method is called after the component has been initialized and all parameters and properties have been set.

Here's the updated code:

```
<TabSet @ref="tabSet">
 ...
</TabSet>

@code {
    private TabSet tabSet;   
    ...

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }
}
```

This way, the event handler will be assigned to `tabSet.TabChanged` only once, after the component has been initialized.
