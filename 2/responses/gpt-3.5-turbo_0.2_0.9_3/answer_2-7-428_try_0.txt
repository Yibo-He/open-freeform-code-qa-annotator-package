It seems like you have set up Sanctum correctly, but there might be an issue with how you are generating and using the token.

Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed and configured Sanctum correctly. You can check the official documentation for more information.

2. Generate a new token for the user using the `createToken` method. You can do this in your controller or in a separate command. Here is an example:

```
$user = User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('token-name')->plainTextToken;
```

3. Make sure that you are using the correct token in Postman. You can check the token by printing it in your controller or by checking the `personal_access_tokens` table in your database.

4. Check if the token is being passed correctly in the request. You can do this by adding a middleware to your route that logs the request headers. Here is an example:

```
Route::middleware(['auth:sanctum', function ($request, $next) {
    Log::info($request->headers->all());
    return $next($request);
}])->apiResource('/documents','DocumentHandlerController');
```

5. If the token is being passed correctly, check if the user is authenticated in your controller. You can do this by calling the `user` method on the request object. Here is an example:

```
public function index(Request $request)
{
    $user = $request->user();
    if ($user) {
        return response()->json(['Success'],Response::HTTP_OK);
    } else {
        return response()->json(['Unauthorized'],Response::HTTP_UNAUTHORIZED);
    }
}
```

I hope this helps you troubleshoot the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
