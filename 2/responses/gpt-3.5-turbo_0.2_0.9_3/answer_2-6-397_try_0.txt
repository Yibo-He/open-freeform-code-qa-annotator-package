It is possible that the Browser Link middleware is being added automatically by Visual Studio or IIS Express. You can try disabling it by adding the following code to your `Startup.cs` file:

```
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
    context.Response.Headers.Remove("X-AspNet-Version");
    await next();
});
```

This code removes the `X-AspNet-Version` header, which is added by the Browser Link middleware. If this header is not present in the response, the Browser Link middleware will not be able to connect to the browser.

If this does not work, you can try disabling the Browser Link middleware explicitly by adding the following code to your `Startup.cs` file:

```
app.UseBrowserLink(options =>
{
    options.Enabled = false;
});
```

This code disables the Browser Link middleware explicitly, even if it is being added automatically by Visual Studio or IIS Express.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try disabling the Browser Link feature in Visual Studio itself. To do this, go to `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > ASP.NET Core` and uncheck the `Enable Browser Link` option.
