It seems like the EasyAdminBundle routes are not being loaded. 

Please make sure that the `config/bundles.php` file contains the following line:

```
EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\EasyAdminBundle::class => ['all' => true],
```

If it's not there, add it and try again. 

Also, make sure that the `config/packages/easy_admin.yaml` file exists and contains the basic configuration for EasyAdminBundle:

```
# config/packages/easy_admin.yaml

easy_admin:
    design:
        brand_color: '#your_brand_color'
```

If it still doesn't work, try running the following commands:

```
symfony composer require annotations
symfony console cache:clear
symfony console cache:warmup
```

Then, check if the `/admin` route is available.
