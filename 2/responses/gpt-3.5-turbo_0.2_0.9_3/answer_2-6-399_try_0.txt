To download the artifacts generated by the latest build of a public Azure DevOps project, you can use the Azure DevOps REST API. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Get the latest build ID of the project by making a GET request to the following URL:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/latest/{definitionId}?api-version=6.0
   ```

   Replace `{organization}` with the name of your organization, `{project}` with the name of your project, and `{definitionId}` with the ID of the build definition. In your case, the URL would be:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_apis/build/latest/3?api-version=6.0
   ```

   This will return a JSON response containing information about the latest build, including its ID.

2. Get the download URL for the artifacts of the latest build by making a GET request to the following URL:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/{organization}/{project}/_apis/build/builds/{buildId}/artifacts?api-version=6.0
   ```

   Replace `{organization}` with the name of your organization, `{project}` with the name of your project, and `{buildId}` with the ID of the latest build you obtained in step 1. In your case, the URL would be:

   ```
   https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_apis/build/builds/123456/artifacts?api-version=6.0
   ```

   This will return a JSON response containing information about the artifacts of the latest build, including their download URLs.

3. Download the artifacts by making a GET request to the download URL of the artifact you want to download. The download URL is contained in the `resource.downloadUrl` property of the JSON response you obtained in step 2.

   You can use an `HttpClient` to make the GET request and download the artifact. Here's an example:

   ```csharp
   using (var httpClient = new HttpClient())
   {
       var downloadUrl = "https://dev.azure.com/LumiaWoA/Boot%20Shim/_apis/build/builds/123456/artifacts?artifactName=MyArtifact&api-version=6.0&%24format=zip";
       var response = await httpClient.GetAsync(downloadUrl);
       response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
       using (var stream = await response.Content.ReadAsStreamAsync())
       {
           // Save the artifact to a file or do something else with it
       }
   }
   ```

   Replace `downloadUrl` with the download URL of the artifact you want to download, which you obtained in step 2. In this example, the artifact is downloaded as a ZIP file. You can modify the `downloadUrl` to download the artifact in a different format or with different parameters.
