It seems like you have set up Sanctum correctly, but there might be an issue with the token generation or the way you are passing the token in Postman. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure you are generating the token for the correct user. You can check the user ID in the token payload to verify this.

2. Double-check that you are passing the token correctly in Postman. You should be adding it to the "Authorization" header as "Bearer {token}".

3. Check if there are any typos or errors in the token itself. You can try generating a new token and see if that works.

4. Make sure the token is not expired. By default, Sanctum tokens expire after 1 hour. You can increase the token expiration time by modifying the `lifetime` value in the `config/sanctum.php` file.

5. Check if there are any other middleware or authentication guards that might be interfering with Sanctum. Make sure that the `auth:sanctum` middleware is the only one applied to the route.

If none of these solutions work, you can try enabling Sanctum's debug mode by setting the `SANCTUM_STATEFUL_DOMAINS` environment variable to your application's domain. This will allow you to see more detailed error messages in the response.
