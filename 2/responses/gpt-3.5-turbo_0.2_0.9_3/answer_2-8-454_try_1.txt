The approach you have taken is a valid one and is recommended by the official Go documentation. It is called a "local replace directive" and is used to replace a module with a local directory during development.

This approach is useful when you are working on multiple modules within the same repository and want to test them together. It is also useful when you are working on a module that is not yet ready for release and want to test it with other modules.

However, when you are ready to release your modules, it is recommended to create separate repositories for each module. This makes it easier to manage the modules and their dependencies, and allows other developers to easily use your modules in their projects.

In summary, the best practice approach for having multiple modules within the same repository is to use local replace directives during development, and to create separate repositories for each module when you are ready to release them.
