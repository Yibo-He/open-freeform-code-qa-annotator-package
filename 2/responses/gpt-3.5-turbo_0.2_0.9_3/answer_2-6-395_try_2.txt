To add XML comments to your API endpoints in .NET6, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enable XML documentation in your project settings. Right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select Properties, and go to the Build tab. Check the "XML documentation file" option and specify a file name.

2. Add XML comments to your API endpoints. In your code, add comments above your endpoint methods that describe the purpose and parameters of the endpoint. For example:

```
/// <summary>
/// Gets a list of clients.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="repo">The client repository.</param>
/// <returns>A list of client models.</returns>
app.MapGet("/clients",
     async (IClientRepository repo) =>
     {
          var results = await repo.GetClientsAsync();
          return mapper.Map<IEnumerable<ClientModel>>(results);
     });
```

3. Configure Swagger to use the XML comments. In your Startup.cs file, add the following code to the ConfigureServices method:

```
services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
{
    c.IncludeXmlComments(Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "YourXmlFileName.xml"));
});
```

Replace "YourXmlFileName" with the name of the XML file you specified in step 1.

After following these steps, your API endpoints should have descriptions in the SwaggerUI.
