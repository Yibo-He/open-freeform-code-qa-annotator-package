The error message indicates that the `resttemplate` library is not recognized by the openapi-generator-gradle-plugin. Instead, you can try using the `spring-mvc` library, which also generates code that uses RestTemplate.

To use the `spring-mvc` library, replace this line in your build.gradle file:

```
library = "resttemplate"
```

with this line:

```
library = "spring-mvc"
```

Then run the build again and the code should be generated using the Spring MVC library.
