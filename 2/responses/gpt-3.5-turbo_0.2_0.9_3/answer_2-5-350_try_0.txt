This error occurs when Gradle is unable to access a file due to exclusive access being held by another process. This can happen if another instance of Gradle is running or if the file is locked by another program.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Close any other instances of VS Code or Android Studio that may be running.
2. Delete the `C:\Users\sanjay.gradle` directory and restart VS Code.
3. If the issue persists, try deleting the `C:\Users\sanjay\.gradle` directory as well.
4. If the issue still persists, try restarting your computer and then running the application again.

If none of these steps work, you can try updating Gradle manually by downloading the latest version from the Gradle website and replacing the existing `gradle-wrapper.jar` file in your project's `gradle/wrapper` directory with the new one.
