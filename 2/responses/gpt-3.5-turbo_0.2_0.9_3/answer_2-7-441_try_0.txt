This error message is related to Laravel Telescope, which is trying to access a null value in the QueryWatcher class. One possible solution is to disable Telescope during testing by adding the following line to your `phpunit.xml` file:

```
<env name="TELESCOPE_ENABLED" value="false"/>
```

This will prevent Telescope from running during your tests and should resolve the issue.

Alternatively, you can try updating your Laravel and Telescope versions to the latest ones, as this issue may have been fixed in a newer release.

Lastly, you can also try running your tests with a different database driver, such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, as this issue may be related to SQLite.
