Yes, you can customize the error messages that are displayed to the user when there is a connection issue with the server. 

In your Blazor component, you can add the following code to customize the error message:

```csharp
protected override void OnInitialized()
{
    base.OnInitialized();
    var hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
        .WithUrl(NavigationManager.ToAbsoluteUri("/myhub"))
        .Build();

    hubConnection.Closed += async (error) =>
    {
        await Task.Delay(new Random().Next(0, 5) * 1000);
        await hubConnection.StartAsync();
    };

    hubConnection.OnClose((exception) =>
    {
        // customize the error message here
        Console.WriteLine("Connection closed.");
    });

    hubConnection.StartAsync();
}
```

In the `OnClose` method, you can customize the error message to display to the user. You can also translate the message to another language if needed.

Additionally, you can disable the automatic reconnection attempts by removing the `hubConnection.Closed` event handler. This will prevent the "Attempting to reconnect to the server" message from appearing. However, keep in mind that this may result in a poor user experience if the user is disconnected from the server for an extended period of time.
