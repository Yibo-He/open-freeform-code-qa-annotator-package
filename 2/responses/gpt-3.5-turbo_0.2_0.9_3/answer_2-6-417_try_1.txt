Yes, you can customize the error messages that are displayed to the user when the connection is lost or when the server is attempting to reconnect. 

To do this, you can modify the `Blazor.default.js` file that is included in your project. This file is located in the `wwwroot/_framework/blazor` folder.

Open the `Blazor.default.js` file and search for the following lines of code:

```javascript
reconnectDisplay: {
    show: function (message) {
        console.warn(message);
        var element = document.getElementById('blazor-error-ui');
        element.innerText = 'Attempting to reconnect to the server...';
        element.style.display = 'block';
    },
    hide: function () {
        var element = document.getElementById('blazor-error-ui');
        element.style.display = 'none';
    }
},
```

These lines of code control the display of the "Attempting to reconnect to the server" message. You can modify the text that is displayed by changing the following line:

```javascript
element.innerText = 'Attempting to reconnect to the server...';
```

You can also modify the `Disconnected from server. Reload page ...` message by searching for the following lines of code:

```javascript
disconnectedDisplay: {
    show: function (message) {
        console.warn(message);
        var element = document.getElementById('blazor-error-ui');
        element.innerText = 'Disconnected from server. Reload page to try again.';
        element.style.display = 'block';
    },
    hide: function () {
        var element = document.getElementById('blazor-error-ui');
        element.style.display = 'none';
    }
},
```

Again, you can modify the text that is displayed by changing the following line:

```javascript
element.innerText = 'Disconnected from server. Reload page to try again.';
```

You can also translate these messages to another language by replacing the English text with the translated text.

Once you have made your changes, save the `Blazor.default.js` file and publish your application again. The new error messages should now be displayed to the user.
