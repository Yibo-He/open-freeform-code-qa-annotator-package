The issue is that the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the component has rendered for the first time, so the `tabSet` reference is still null at that point. One solution is to use the `OnInitialized` method to assign the reference to `tabSet` and then subscribe to the `TabChanged` event in the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method only if `tabSet` is not null. Here's the updated code:

```
<TabSet @ref="tabSet">
 ...
</TabSet>

@code {
    private TabSet tabSet;

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }

    protected override async Task OnAfterRenderAsync(bool firstRender)
    {
        if(firstRender && tabSet != null)
        {
            tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
        }       
    }
}
```

This way, the `TabChanged` event will be subscribed to only after the `tabSet` reference has been assigned in the `OnInitialized` method.
