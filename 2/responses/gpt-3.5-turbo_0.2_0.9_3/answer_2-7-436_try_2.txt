This error message indicates that your current PHP version and Composer version are not compatible with Laravel 9. 

Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher, and Composer 2.1 or higher. You can check your current PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal, and your Composer version by running `composer -V`.

To resolve this issue, you can try upgrading your PHP version to 8.0 or higher, and upgrading your Composer version to 2.1 or higher. Once you have done this, you should be able to run the `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"` command successfully.

Alternatively, you can try installing an earlier version of Laravel that is compatible with your current PHP and Composer versions. For example, you can try running `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "8.*"` to install Laravel 8.
