When C#8's nullability context is enabled, you need to explicitly declare whether a property is nullable or not. In your case, the error is because the `ServiceUrl` property is not marked as nullable, but it is not initialized in the constructor or with a default value.

To fix this error, you can mark the `ServiceUrl` property as nullable by adding a `?` after the type declaration:

```
public string? ServiceUrl { get; set; }
```

This tells the compiler that the property can be null, and the error should go away.

Alternatively, you can initialize the property with a default value in the constructor:

```
public class Connection
{
    public Connection()
    {
        ServiceUrl = "";
    }

    public string ServiceUrl { get; set; }
    public string? UserName { get; set; }
    public string? Password { get; set; }
    //... others 
}
```

This initializes the `ServiceUrl` property with an empty string, which is a non-null value.
