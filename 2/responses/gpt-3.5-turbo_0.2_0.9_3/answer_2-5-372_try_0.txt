It seems like there might be a version conflict between the Hibernate Validator version that is being used by your Spring Boot application and the version that is being resolved by Maven. 

You can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot starter dependencies and explicitly adding the version that you want to use. For example, you can add the following to your pom.xml:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter validation dependency and add the version that you want to use explicitly. 

Alternatively, you can try upgrading your Spring Boot version to a version that uses Hibernate Validator 6.x, which might resolve the conflict.
