The error message indicates that the PHP curl extension is not enabled on your server, and the allow_url_fopen setting is disabled in your php.ini file. 

To fix this issue, you need to enable the PHP curl extension and allow_url_fopen setting in your php.ini file. 

Here are the steps to enable the PHP curl extension and allow_url_fopen setting:

1. Login to your cPanel account and go to the "Select PHP Version" option under the "Software" section.

2. Click on the "Switch to PHP Options" button.

3. Find the "curl" and "allow_url_fopen" options and set them to "On".

4. Click on the "Save" button to save the changes.

5. Restart the Apache server.

After completing these steps, try running the "composer update" command again. It should work without any errors.
