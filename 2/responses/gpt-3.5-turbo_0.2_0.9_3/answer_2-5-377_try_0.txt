The issue with your code is that you are trying to format a `LocalDate` object using a `DateFormat` that expects a `Date` object. You need to convert the `LocalDate` to a `Date` before formatting it.

Here's an updated version of your code that should work:

```
public static String generateRandomDateAndTimeInString() {
    LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now().minus(Duration.ofDays((new Random().nextInt(365 * 70))));
    System.out.println("date and time :: " + dateTime.toString());
    return formatDate(dateTime) ;
}

public static String formatDate(LocalDateTime dateTime){
    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'");
    return dateTime.format(formatter);
}
```

Changes made:

- Changed `LocalDate` to `LocalDateTime` to include time.
- Changed `Period` to `Duration` to subtract days from `LocalDateTime`.
- Changed `DateFormat` to `DateTimeFormatter` for better thread-safety and readability.
- Changed the format pattern to include time zone `'Z'`.

With these changes, the output should look something like this:

```
date and time :: 1954-06-06T09:32:44.123456
1954-06-06T09:32:44Z
```
