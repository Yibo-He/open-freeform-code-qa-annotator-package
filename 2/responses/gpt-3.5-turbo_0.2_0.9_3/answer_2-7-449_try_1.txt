It seems like you are trying to override a function in a vendor file, which is not recommended as it can cause issues with future updates and maintenance of your application. Instead, you can create a middleware that modifies the request object before it reaches the router.

Here's an example middleware that removes the trailing slash from the request URI:

```
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;

class RemoveTrailingSlash
{
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $uri = $request->getRequestUri();
        if (substr($uri, -1) === '/') {
            $request->server->set('REQUEST_URI', substr($uri, 0, -1));
        }
        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

Then, you can register this middleware in your `App\Http\Kernel` class:

```
protected $middleware = [
    // ...
    \App\Http\Middleware\RemoveTrailingSlash::class,
];
```

This way, the middleware will modify the request object before it reaches the router, and you don't have to modify any vendor files.
