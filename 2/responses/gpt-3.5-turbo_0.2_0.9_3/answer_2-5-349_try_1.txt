To send a path variable in a POST mapping using Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Set the request method to POST.
3. Enter the URL of the endpoint, including the path variable. For example, `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/123`.
4. Click on the "Body" tab.
5. Select the "raw" option and set the format to "JSON".
6. Enter the request body in JSON format. For example:

```
{
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "johndoe@example.com"
}
```

7. Click on the "Send" button to send the request.

In your example code, the `@PathVariable` annotation is used to capture the `code` variable from the URL path. The `@RequestBody` annotation is used to map the request body to the `CustomerDTO` object. When you send a POST request with a path variable and a request body, the `postRequest` method will be called with the `code` variable and the `CustomerDTO` object as parameters.
