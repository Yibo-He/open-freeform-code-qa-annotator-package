In Go, you can convert an integer to its ASCII equivalent by using the `fmt.Sprintf` function. Here's an example:

```
a := 49
ascii := fmt.Sprintf("%c", a)
fmt.Println(ascii) // Output: 1
```

In your code, you are assigning a string to the variable `a`. To convert a string to its ASCII equivalent, you need to convert each character in the string to its ASCII value. Here's an example:

```
a := "42"
for _, c := range a {
    ascii := fmt.Sprintf("%c", c)
    fmt.Println(ascii)
}
```

This will output:

```
4
2
``` 

Note that the `range` function is used to iterate over each character in the string.
