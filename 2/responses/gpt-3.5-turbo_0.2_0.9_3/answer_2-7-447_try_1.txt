To save multiple arrays with separate attributes into the database as a collection, you can use a loop to iterate through the arrays and create a new Bet model for each set of values. Here's an example of how you can do it in your Laravel controller:

```
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $tw_names = $request->input('tw_name');
    $tw_prices = $request->input('tw_price');

    $bets = [];

    foreach ($tw_names as $key => $name) {
        $bets[] = [
            'name' => $name,
            'price' => $tw_prices[$key],
        ];
    }

    Bet::insert($bets);

    return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'Bets saved successfully.');
}
```

In this example, we first retrieve the `tw_name` and `tw_price` arrays from the request. We then create an empty array called `$bets` to store the Bet models that we will create.

Next, we loop through the `$tw_names` array using the `foreach` loop. For each iteration, we create a new array with the `name` and `price` values from the corresponding positions in the `$tw_names` and `$tw_prices` arrays. We then add this array to the `$bets` array.

Finally, we use the `insert` method of the `Bet` model to insert all the Bet models at once into the database. This is more efficient than creating and saving each model individually.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
