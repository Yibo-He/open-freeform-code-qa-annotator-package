Based on the error message, it seems like there is a version incompatibility issue between Spring Cloud and OpenFeign. 

You are using Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR8, which is compatible with OpenFeign 2.2.3.RELEASE. However, you are using OpenFeign 2.2.5.RELEASE, which may not be compatible with Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR8.

To fix this issue, you can try downgrading OpenFeign to version 2.2.3.RELEASE by updating the dependency in your pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-openfeign</artifactId>
    <version>2.2.3.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
```

After updating the dependency, try running your Spring Boot application again.
