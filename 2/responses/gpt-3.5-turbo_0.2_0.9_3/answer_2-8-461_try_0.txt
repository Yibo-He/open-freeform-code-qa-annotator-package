It seems like you are trying to insert values of different types into the `com2` column. Please make sure that the data type of the `com2` column in your database matches the data type of the `result.Com2` variable in your code. 

Also, you can try using a single SQL statement with multiple value sets for bulk insertion, like this:

```
query := `INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES `
values := []interface{}{}
for _, result := range results {
    query += `($1,$2,$3,$4),`
    values = append(values, result.Com1, result.Com2, result.Path, result.Time)
}
query = query[:len(query)-1] // remove the last comma
_, err := db.Exec(query, values...)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

This will create a single SQL statement with multiple value sets, which can be executed in a single transaction for faster insertion.
