It seems like the issue is related to running the debugger under Rosetta, which is not supported by the debugger. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have installed the latest version of the Go extension for VS Code.

2. Check that you have the correct version of Go installed for your CPU architecture. You can check this by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go env GOARCH
   ```

   This should return `arm64` for your M1 Mac.

3. Try running VS Code natively on your M1 Mac instead of under Rosetta. You can do this by right-clicking on the VS Code app icon and selecting "Get Info". Then, check the "Open using Rosetta" option to disable it.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different debugger like Delve instead of dlv. You can install Delve by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   go get github.com/go-delve/delve/cmd/dlv
   ```

   Then, update your launch configuration in VS Code to use Delve instead of dlv.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
