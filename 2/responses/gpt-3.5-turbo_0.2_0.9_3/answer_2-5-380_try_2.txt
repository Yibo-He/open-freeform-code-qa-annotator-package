There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the Spring Boot application is running and accessible at localhost:8080. You can test this by accessing localhost:8080 in your web browser and seeing if the application responds.

2. Check that the springdoc-openapi-ui dependency is correctly added to your pom.xml file and that it is being downloaded by Maven. You can check this by running `mvn dependency:tree` and verifying that the dependency is listed.

3. Verify that the OpenAPI specification is correctly configured in your Spring Boot application. You can do this by checking that the `@OpenAPIDefinition` annotation is present on your main application class and that it specifies the correct OpenAPI version.

4. Check that the Swagger UI endpoint is correctly configured in your Spring Boot application. You can do this by verifying that the `@EnableSwagger2` annotation is present on your main application class and that it specifies the correct URL path for the Swagger UI endpoint.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more information about your application configuration and error messages to diagnose the problem further.
