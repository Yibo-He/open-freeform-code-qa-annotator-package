You can add a custom attribute to a cookie in ASP.NET Core by creating a new instance of the `CookieOptions` class and setting the `SameSite` property to `SameSiteMode.None`. Here's an example:

```csharp
var cookieOptions = new CookieOptions
{
    SameSite = SameSiteMode.None,
    Secure = true, // Set this to true if the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS
    HttpOnly = true // Set this to true if the cookie should not be accessible from JavaScript
};

Response.Cookies.Append("cookieName", "cookieValue", cookieOptions);
```

This will add a cookie with the name "cookieName" and the value "cookieValue", along with the `SameSite: None` attribute. Note that you should also set the `Secure` property to true if the cookie should only be sent over HTTPS, and the `HttpOnly` property to true if the cookie should not be accessible from JavaScript.
