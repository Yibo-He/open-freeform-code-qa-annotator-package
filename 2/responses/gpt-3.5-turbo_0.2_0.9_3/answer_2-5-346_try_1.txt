It seems like you have set up everything correctly. However, there might be a possibility that the Gradle settings are overriding your project settings. 

To fix this issue, you can add the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will ensure that Gradle uses Java 17 to compile your code.

If this doesn't work, you can try deleting the `.gradle` folder in your project directory and re-importing the project in IntelliJ. This will reset all the Gradle settings and might fix the issue.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
