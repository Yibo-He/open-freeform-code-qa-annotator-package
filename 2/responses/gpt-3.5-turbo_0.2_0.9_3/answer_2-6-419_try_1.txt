Your approach is correct. You can pass multiple arguments from child to parent upon onClick event in child component by defining a delegate in the parent component and passing it as a parameter to the child component. In the child component, you can use the delegate to invoke the method in the parent component with the required arguments.

In your case, you have defined the delegate `ItemClicked` in the parent component and passed it as a parameter to the child component. In the child component, you have used the `@onclick` directive to invoke the `ItemClicked` delegate with the required arguments.

When the user clicks on the `span` element in the child component, the `ItemClicked` delegate is invoked with the `name` and `id` arguments. These arguments are then passed to the `ItemClicked` method in the parent component, where you can perform the required actions.

Your code looks good and should work as expected.
