It looks like you have set up Sanctum correctly, but there might be an issue with the way you are generating and using the token. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure you are generating the token for the correct user. You can use the `createToken` method on the user model to generate a token:

```
$user = User::find(1);
$token = $user->createToken('token-name')->plainTextToken;
```

2. Make sure you are passing the token correctly in Postman. You should set the Authorization header to `Bearer {token}` where `{token}` is the token you generated in step 1.

3. Make sure you are sending the request to the correct endpoint. In your case, it should be `http://localhost:8000/api/documents`.

If you have checked all of the above and are still getting an unauthenticated error, you can try adding some debug statements to see where the error is coming from. For example, you can add the following to your `Authenticate` middleware:

```
public function handle($request)
{
    if (! $request->expectsJson()) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Unauthorized'], 401);
    }

    if (! $request->bearerToken()) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Token not provided'], 401);
    }

    if (! Auth::guard('sanctum')->check()) {
        return response()->json(['message' => 'Invalid token'], 401);
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```

This will check if the request expects JSON, if a token was provided, and if the token is valid. If any of these checks fail, it will return an appropriate error message.
