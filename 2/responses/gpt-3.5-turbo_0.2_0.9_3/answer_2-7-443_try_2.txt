You can't pass an array directly as a route parameter. One way to solve this is to convert the array to a string using `json_encode()` or `serialize()` and then pass it as a parameter. 

In your case, you used `serialize()` to convert the array to a string, but the error message you received indicates that the serialized string is being interpreted as separate parameters. 

To fix this, you can use `urlencode()` to encode the serialized string before passing it as a parameter. Then, in your route handler, you can use `urldecode()` and `unserialize()` to convert the parameter back to an array.

Here's an example:

```
// Generating the URL
$array = [
  'a' => 'one',
  'b' => 1,
  // ...
];
$url = route('route.name', ['array' => urlencode(serialize($array))]);

// Handling the route
Route::get('/example/{array}', function ($encodedArray) {
  $array = unserialize(urldecode($encodedArray));
  // Use $array as needed
});
```

This should allow you to pass an array of any size and structure as a route parameter.
