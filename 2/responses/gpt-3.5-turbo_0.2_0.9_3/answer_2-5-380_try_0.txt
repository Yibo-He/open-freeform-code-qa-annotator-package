There are a few things you can check to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Make sure that the Spring Boot application is running and accessible at localhost:8080. You can try accessing other endpoints to confirm this.

2. Check if the swagger-ui.html file is present in the correct location. By default, the file should be located at /src/main/resources/META-INF/resources/swagger-ui.html. If the file is not present, you can try rebuilding the project or adding it manually.

3. Check if the OpenAPI documentation is accessible at /v3/api-docs. You can try accessing this endpoint directly to confirm if the documentation is available. If it's not available, you may need to check your OpenAPI configuration.

4. Check if there are any conflicting dependencies or configurations that may be causing issues. You can try removing any other OpenAPI or Swagger dependencies and configurations to see if that resolves the issue.

5. Try accessing the Swagger UI at localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html instead of localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html. This may work if there are any issues with the default URL.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue and get Swagger UI working in your Spring Boot application.
