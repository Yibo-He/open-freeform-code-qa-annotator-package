The error message suggests that `expressJwt` is not a function. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. `express-jwt` module is not installed: Make sure that you have installed the `express-jwt` module by running `npm install express-jwt` in your project directory.

2. Incorrect import statement: Make sure that you are importing `expressJwt` correctly. It should be imported like this:
```
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

3. Version incompatibility: Check if you are using the correct version of `express-jwt` that supports the `expressJwt` function. If you are using an older version, try updating it to the latest version.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project setup and the versions of the modules you are using.
