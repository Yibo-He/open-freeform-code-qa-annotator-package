In .NET Core, you can use the `JsonResult` class to return JSON data with a HTTP status code. Here's an example:

```
public JsonResult GetResourceData()
{
    return Json(new { response = "Hello" }, new JsonSerializerSettings { Formatting = Formatting.Indented });
}
```

In this example, we're returning a `JsonResult` object with a JSON payload and an HTTP status code of 200 (OK). The `Json` method serializes the object to JSON and sets the content type to `application/json`.

You can also set the HTTP status code explicitly by using the `StatusCode` property of the `JsonResult` object:

```
public JsonResult GetResourceData()
{
    var data = new { response = "Hello" };
    var result = new JsonResult(data);
    result.StatusCode = 200;
    return result;
}
```

This code does the same thing as the previous example, but sets the status code explicitly.
