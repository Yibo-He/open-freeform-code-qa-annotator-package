It seems like the issue is with the version of Java you are using. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or higher to run, and you are currently using Java 8. 

You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). Once you have installed Java 11 or higher, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the installation directory of the new version of Java.

To set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, follow these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under "System Variables", click on "New".
5. Enter `JAVA_HOME` as the variable name.
6. Enter the installation directory of Java 11 or higher as the variable value (e.g. `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11.0.11`).
7. Click "OK" to save the changes.

After setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, try running the `bin\besu --help` command again and see if the issue is resolved.
