To get the current user's role using Spatie/Roles in Laravel, you can use the `auth()` helper function to get the authenticated user and then call the `hasRole()` method on the user object.

Here's an example:

```
if(auth()->user()->hasRole('admin')) {
    // do something
}
```

Make sure that the authenticated user is not null before calling the `hasRole()` method to avoid any errors.
