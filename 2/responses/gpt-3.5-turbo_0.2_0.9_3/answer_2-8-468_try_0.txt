In Go, you can convert an integer to its ASCII equivalent by using the `fmt.Sprintf` function. Here's an example:

```
a := 49
ascii := fmt.Sprintf("%c", a)
fmt.Println(ascii) // Output: 1
```

In your example, you're trying to assign a string to a rune variable, which is causing the error. To fix it, you can convert the string to an integer first using the `strconv.Atoi` function:

```
a := "42"
num, _ := strconv.Atoi(a)
ascii := fmt.Sprintf("%c", num)
fmt.Println(ascii) // Output: *
```

This will convert the string "42" to the integer 42, which corresponds to the ASCII code for the asterisk character.
