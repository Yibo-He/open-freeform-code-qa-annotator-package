You can use the `dump()` function instead of `dd()` to view the nested data. The `dump()` function is similar to `dd()` but it does not stop the execution of the script. This means that you can continue to view the data in your browser without having to reload the page.

To increase the `dump()` function limitations, you can add the following lines of code to your `config/app.php` file:

```
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Illuminate\Debug\DumperServiceProvider::class,
],

'debug' => [
    // ...
    'max_items' => 2500,
    'max_string_length' => 10000,
],
```

This will increase the maximum number of items and the maximum string length that can be displayed by the `dump()` function.

Alternatively, you can use a third-party package like Laravel Debugbar or Clockwork to view the nested data in a more organized and user-friendly way. These packages provide a toolbar that displays information about the current request, including the database queries, HTTP requests, and response data.
