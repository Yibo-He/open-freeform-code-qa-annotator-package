It seems like the error is related to the JNA library not being able to link with the C library. This could be due to a mismatch in architecture between the JNA library and the system architecture.

One possible solution is to try installing the JNA library separately and then linking it with Cassandra. You can download the JNA library from the official website (https://github.com/java-native-access/jna) and then add it to the classpath of Cassandra.

Another solution is to try running Cassandra in a Docker container. This can help avoid any compatibility issues with the system architecture.

You can also try running Cassandra with a different version of JDK, such as JDK11 or JDK16, to see if that resolves the issue.

Lastly, you can check if there are any updates or patches available for Cassandra that address this issue.
