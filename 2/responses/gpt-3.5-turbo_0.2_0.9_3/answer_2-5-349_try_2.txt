To send a path variable in a POST request using Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Select the HTTP method as POST.
3. Enter the URL with the path variable in the format `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/{code}`. Replace `{code}` with the actual value of the path variable.
4. Go to the Body tab and select the raw option.
5. Select the format of the request body, such as JSON or XML.
6. Enter the request body in the format specified by the selected format.
7. Click on the Send button to send the request.

In the above example, you can send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/123` with the request body in JSON format. The value of the path variable `code` will be `123`.
