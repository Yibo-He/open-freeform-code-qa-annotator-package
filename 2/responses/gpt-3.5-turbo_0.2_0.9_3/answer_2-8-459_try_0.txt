It sounds like the issue might be related to authentication. Here are a few things you can try to debug the issue:

1. Check that your GitHub credentials are properly configured on computer B. You can do this by running `git config --list` and checking that your `user.name` and `user.email` are set correctly. You can also try running `git clone` on the dependent repo to see if you can access it directly.

2. Check that your `GOPRIVATE` environment variable is set correctly. If the dependent repo is private, you need to set `GOPRIVATE` to include the domain name. For example, if the dependent repo is hosted on `github.ibm.com`, you would set `GOPRIVATE=github.ibm.com`.

3. Check that your `GONOPROXY` and `GONOSUMDB` environment variables are set correctly. If the dependent repo is hosted on a private server, you need to set `GONOPROXY` to exclude the server from the proxy lookup. You also need to set `GONOSUMDB` to exclude the server from the checksum database lookup. For example, if the dependent repo is hosted on `github.ibm.com`, you would set `GONOPROXY=github.ibm.com` and `GONOSUMDB=github.ibm.com`.

4. Check that your `go.mod` file is correct. Make sure that the version constraint for the dependent repo is correct and that the module path is correct.

If none of these steps help, you can try running `go env` on both computers and comparing the output to see if there are any differences that might be causing the issue. You can also try running `go mod download` to force the download of all dependencies and see if that resolves the issue.
