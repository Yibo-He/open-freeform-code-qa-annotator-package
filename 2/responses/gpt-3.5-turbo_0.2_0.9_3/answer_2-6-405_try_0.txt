The issue seems to be with the model class. You have defined the properties as public fields instead of properties with getters and setters. 

Change the model class to:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

This should fix the issue and return the expected response.
