Having two separate pipelines for two specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice or a bad idea. In fact, it can be a good approach if the two requests have very different requirements and logic. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design of your application and ensure that you're not creating unnecessary complexity. If the two requests have some common logic or requirements, it might be better to have a single pipeline with conditional logic to handle each request differently.

Ultimately, the decision should be based on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
