The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have sufficient permissions to clear the cache. 

To fix this issue, you can try running the command with elevated privileges. For example, you can try running the command with `sudo`:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

Alternatively, you can try changing the ownership of the storage directory to the user running the command:

```
sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername storage
```

Replace `yourusername` with the actual username of the user running the command. 

After changing the ownership, try running the `php artisan cache:clear` command again.
