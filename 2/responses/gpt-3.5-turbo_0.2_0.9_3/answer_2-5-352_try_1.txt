It seems like the issue is with the version of Java you are using. Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run, and you currently have Java 8 installed.

You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).

Once you have installed Java 11 or later, you can try running the `bin\besu` command again and it should work without any issues.
