The error message suggests that there is an issue with linking the C library against JNA. This could be due to a mismatch in architecture between the JNA library and the Cassandra installation.

One solution to this problem is to try installing the JNA library separately and then linking it to Cassandra. You can do this by following these steps:

1. Download the JNA library from the official website: https://github.com/java-native-access/jna

2. Extract the downloaded archive and copy the JAR file to the Cassandra lib directory:

   ```
   cp jna-<version>.jar /opt/homebrew/opt/cassandra/lib/
   ```

3. Set the `jna.library.path` system property to the Cassandra lib directory:

   ```
   export JVM_OPTS="$JVM_OPTS -Djna.library.path=/opt/homebrew/opt/cassandra/lib/"
   ```

4. Start Cassandra again:

   ```
   /opt/homebrew/opt/cassandra/bin/cassandra -f
   ```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to start Cassandra successfully.
