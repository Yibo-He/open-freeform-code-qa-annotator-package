The error message suggests that Composer is unable to find a compatible version of the `ext-zip` package that can be installed in your project. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Your PHP version may not support the `ext-zip` package. Check that your PHP version is compatible with the package by running `php -m | grep zip` in your terminal. If the output is empty, it means that the package is not installed or enabled in your PHP installation.

2. Your Composer dependencies may have conflicts. Try running `composer update` to update your dependencies and resolve any conflicts.

3. Your Composer cache may be corrupted. Try running `composer clear-cache` to clear your Composer cache and then run `composer require ext-zip` again.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to manually install the `ext-zip` package on your system or contact your hosting provider for assistance.
