It seems like you are missing the vendor folder in your project directory. The vendor folder is usually created by Composer when you run the `composer install` or `composer update` command. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the command `composer install` to install all the required dependencies for your project.
3. After the installation is complete, check if the vendor folder is created in your project directory.
4. If the vendor folder is created, try running your code again.

If the issue still persists, you can try deleting the vendor folder and running the `composer install` command again. This will reinstall all the dependencies and create a new vendor folder.

Also, make sure that you are including the correct path to the autoload.php file in your code. The path should be relative to your project directory.
