If you want to use the same version of Java that works with the Maven task, you can try setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the JDK that Maven is using. 

To find out which JDK Maven is using, you can run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```
mvn -version
```

This will display the version of Maven and the path to the JDK that it is using. You can then set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to that path.

For example, if the output of the `mvn -version` command is:

```
Apache Maven 3.6.3
Maven home: /usr/local/Cellar/maven/3.6.3/libexec
Java version: 1.8.0_242, vendor: AdoptOpenJDK, runtime: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home
```

You can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/adoptopenjdk-8.jdk/Contents/Home`.

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, you can try running the Maven wrapper again and it should use the same version of Java that Maven is using.
