In ASP.NET Core, you can use the `IHttpContextAccessor` service to create a global variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add the `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Http` package to your project.

2. In the `Startup.cs` file, add the following code to the `ConfigureServices` method:

```
services.AddHttpContextAccessor();
```

3. In the class where you want to create the global variable, inject the `IHttpContextAccessor` service:

```
private readonly IHttpContextAccessor _httpContextAccessor;

public MyClass(IHttpContextAccessor httpContextAccessor)
{
    _httpContextAccessor = httpContextAccessor;
}
```

4. Create the global variable and set its value:

```
_httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Items["<variableName>"] = <value>;
```

You can access the global variable from any part of your application using the `IHttpContextAccessor` service. For example:

```
var myValue = _httpContextAccessor.HttpContext.Items["<variableName>"];
```
