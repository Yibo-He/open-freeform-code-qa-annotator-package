The error message you are receiving indicates that the `TodoItems` table already exists in your database, and the migration you are trying to apply is attempting to create it again. This is likely because the `TodoItems` table was created by a previous migration, and the new migration is not aware of this.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Delete the `TodoItems` table from your database manually. You can do this using a SQL client such as MySQL Workbench or by running a SQL command in your terminal.

2. Re-run the migration command with the `-verbose` flag to get more information about what is happening during the migration process. This may help you identify any issues that are causing the migration to fail.

3. Check that your `TodoItemsContext` is correctly configured to use the correct database. You can do this by checking the `options` parameter passed to the constructor of your context.

4. Ensure that you are running the migration command from the correct project directory. If you have multiple projects in your solution, make sure you are running the command from the project that contains the `TodoItemsContext`.

5. Try running the migration command with the `-force` flag. This will force the migration to run even if it encounters errors. However, be aware that this may cause data loss or other issues if the migration is not able to complete successfully.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to provide more information about your project setup and the specific error messages you are receiving in order to diagnose the problem further.
