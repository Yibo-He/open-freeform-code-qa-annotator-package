The issue is with the property key in the `@Value` annotation. You have used `main.header1.info` instead of `main.header.info`. The correct property key should be `main.header.info` as per the structure of your `data.yml` file.

So, you can fix the issue by changing the `@Value` annotation to:

```
@Value("${main.header.info}")
private long info;
```

This should inject the value of `info` property from `data.yml` file to the `info` field of `SomeClass`.
