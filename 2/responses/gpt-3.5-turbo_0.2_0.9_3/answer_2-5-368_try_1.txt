Sure, I can help you with that. Here are the steps to enable Dev Tools project on IntelliJ 2021.2:

1. Open your project in IntelliJ 2021.2.
2. Click on the "File" menu and select "Settings".
3. In the Settings window, expand the "Build, Execution, Deployment" option and select "Compiler".
4. In the Compiler settings, check the "Build project automatically" option.
5. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.

Now, to observe the changes in code without having to restart the Tomcat server, follow these steps:

1. Open the "Run" menu and select "Edit Configurations".
2. In the Run/Debug Configurations window, select your Tomcat server configuration.
3. In the "Server" tab, check the "Enable JMX agent" option.
4. In the "Deployment" tab, check the "Deploy applications automatically" option.
5. Click on the "Apply" button to save the changes.

Now, whenever you make changes to your code, IntelliJ will automatically compile and deploy the changes to the Tomcat server. You can observe the changes in real-time without having to restart the server.
