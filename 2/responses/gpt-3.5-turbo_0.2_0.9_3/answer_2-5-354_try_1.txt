The error message suggests that there is a problem with the mapping of the `user` field in the `UserRole` class. The error message says that Hibernate could not determine the type for the `user` field, which is a `List<User>`.

The problem is that you are trying to map a bidirectional relationship between `User` and `UserRole`, but you have not specified the mapping correctly. In particular, you have specified a `@OneToMany` relationship in the `UserRole` class, but you have not specified the corresponding `@ManyToOne` relationship in the `User` class.

To fix the problem, you need to add a `@ManyToOne` annotation to the `userRole` field in the `User` class, like this:

```
@Entity
@Table(name="user")
public class User {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private long id;

    ..........

    @ManyToOne
    @JoinColumn(name="role_id")
    private UserRole userRole;

    .......
}
```

This tells Hibernate that the `userRole` field in the `User` class is the inverse side of the relationship, and that it should use the `role_id` column in the `user` table as the foreign key.

With this change, you should be able to run your application without errors.
