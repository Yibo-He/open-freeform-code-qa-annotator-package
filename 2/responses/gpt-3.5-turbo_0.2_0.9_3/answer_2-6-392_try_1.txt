Having separate pipelines for specific requests is not necessarily a bad practice or idea. In fact, it can be a good way to keep your code organized and maintainable. 

However, it's important to consider the overall design of your application and whether having separate pipelines will lead to duplication of code or unnecessary complexity. 

If the logic for RequestOne and RequestTwo is significantly different and cannot be easily combined into a single pipeline, then having separate pipelines may be the best approach. 

Just make sure that you are following good coding practices, such as keeping your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and avoiding unnecessary complexity.
