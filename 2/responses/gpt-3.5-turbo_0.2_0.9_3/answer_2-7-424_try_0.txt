The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have sufficient permissions to clear the cache. 

To resolve this issue, you can try running the command with elevated privileges. If you are on a Unix-based system, you can use the `sudo` command to run the command as a superuser. For example:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

If you are on a Windows system, you can try running the command prompt as an administrator and then running the command. 

Alternatively, you can manually delete the cache files from the storage directory. The cache files are located in the `storage/framework/cache` directory. You can delete all the files in this directory to clear the cache. 

After clearing the cache, you can try running the `php artisan cache:clear` command again to see if it works.
