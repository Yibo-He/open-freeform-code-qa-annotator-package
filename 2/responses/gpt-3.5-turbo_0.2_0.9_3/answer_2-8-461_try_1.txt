It seems like there is a type mismatch between the column "com2" and the value being passed in the query. Make sure that the data type of the "com2" column in the database table matches the data type of the value being passed in the query. 

Also, you can try using a prepared statement instead of a regular query to improve performance. Here's an example:

```
// Prepare the insert statement
stmt, err := tx.PrepareNamed(`INSERT INTO "DataCom_travel" (com1,com2,path,time) VALUES (:com1,:com2,:path,:time)`)
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}

// Loop through the results and execute the insert statement
for _, result := range results {
    _, err = stmt.Exec(result)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }

    // Execute the update statement
    _, err = tx.Exec(`UPDATE "DataCom_commcombinaison" set done = TRUE WHERE com1 =$1 and com2 =$2`, result.Com1, result.Com2)
    if err != nil {
        // handle error
    }
}

// Commit the transaction
err = tx.Commit()
if err != nil {
    // handle error
}
```

This code uses a prepared statement to insert the data into the "DataCom_travel" table. The `PrepareNamed` function prepares the statement with named parameters, which makes it easier to read and maintain. The `Exec` function executes the statement with the values from the `result` struct.

Also, note that the update statement is executed inside the loop, just like before.
