The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen if the session is not being maintained properly on the server-side. 

Since you mentioned that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, it is possible that the session configuration on the host domain is causing the issue. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Check if the session driver is set to the same value on the host domain as it is on your local environment. If it is different, try changing it to match your local environment.

2. Check if the session cookie domain is set correctly. If it is set to a different domain than the one you are hosting your application on, it can cause issues with session management. 

3. Check if the session cookie path is set correctly. If it is set to a different path than the one your application is running on, it can cause issues with session management. 

4. Check if the session lifetime is set correctly. If it is set too low, it can cause the session to expire before the user completes their task. 

5. Check if there are any caching mechanisms in place on the host domain that could be interfering with session management. 

6. Check if there are any security measures in place on the host domain that could be interfering with session management, such as firewalls or security plugins. 

Once you have checked these configurations, try running your application again and see if the issue persists. If it does, you may need to consult with your hosting provider or a Laravel expert to help you troubleshoot the issue further.
