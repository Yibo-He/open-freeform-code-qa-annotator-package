It seems like there is an issue with the command prompt (cmd) on your system. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the "cmd" program is available on your system by opening the command prompt and typing "cmd". If it is not available, you may need to reinstall it.

2. If "cmd" is available, try running the command prompt as an administrator and then running the build command again.

3. If the issue persists, try modifying the build command to use a different shell program. For example, you can replace "cmd" with "powershell" or "bash" depending on your system.

4. You can also try reinstalling NetBeans and/or Maven to ensure that all the necessary components are properly installed.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue and successfully build your project.
