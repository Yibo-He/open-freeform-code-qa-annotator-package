It looks like the error is occurring because the `project/game` package is not in the GOROOT directory. This is because GOROOT is the directory where Go is installed, and it should not be used for storing your own code.

Instead, you should be using the GOPATH directory to store your code. In your case, the GOPATH is set to `C:\Users\ketchup\go`. So, you should move your `project` directory to `C:\Users\ketchup\go\src`.

Once you have moved the `project` directory to the correct location, you should be able to build your project without any issues. 

Also, make sure that you have set the environment variable `GO111MODULE` to `on` to enable Go modules. This will allow you to use modules in your project and manage dependencies more easily. 

You can set this environment variable by running the following command in your terminal:

```
set GO111MODULE=on
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
