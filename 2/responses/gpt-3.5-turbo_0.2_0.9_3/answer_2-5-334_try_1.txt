The @Configuration annotation is used to define a configuration class in Spring. This class is used to define beans that can be used throughout the application. The main benefit of using @Configuration over @Service/@Controller/@Repository is that it provides a way to define beans that are not tied to a specific layer of the application. 

For example, if you have a service that depends on a repository, you could define both the service and repository as beans using @Service and @Repository annotations respectively. However, if you want to define a bean that is used by both the service and repository, you would need to duplicate the bean definition in both classes. This can lead to code duplication and maintenance issues.

With @Configuration, you can define the bean once and use it throughout the application. Additionally, @Configuration provides more flexibility in defining beans. You can use @Bean annotations to define beans that are not tied to a specific class, and you can also use @Value annotations to inject properties into the bean definitions.

Another benefit of using @Configuration is that it allows you to use the @Import annotation to import other configuration classes. This can be useful for modularizing your application configuration and making it easier to manage.

In summary, while @Service/@Controller/@Repository are useful for defining beans tied to specific layers of the application, @Configuration provides more flexibility and modularity in defining beans that can be used throughout the application.
