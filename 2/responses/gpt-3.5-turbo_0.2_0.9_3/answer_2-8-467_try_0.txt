The issue is that the `Name` and `Age` fields in the `User` struct are not exported (i.e., they start with a lowercase letter). Therefore, they cannot be accessed from outside the package where the `User` struct is defined. 

To fix this issue, you can export the fields by starting their names with an uppercase letter, like this:

```
type User struct {
    Name string `json:"name"`
    Age  int64  `json:"age"`
}
```

Note that I also added the `json` tags to specify the names of the fields in the JSON output. This is a common practice in Go to control the serialization of structs to JSON.
