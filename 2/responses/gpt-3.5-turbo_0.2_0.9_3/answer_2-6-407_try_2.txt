It seems like the issue is with the response received from the server. The error message suggests that the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON and cannot be deserialized by the `GetJsonAsync` method.

To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the response received from the server using a tool like Postman or Fiddler. Make sure that the response is valid JSON and does not contain any unexpected characters.

2. If the response is valid JSON, try using the `HttpClient` class directly instead of the `GetJsonAsync` method. This will allow you to inspect the response and see if there are any issues with the deserialization process.

Here's an example of how you can use the `HttpClient` class to make the same request:

```
var httpClient = new HttpClient();
var response = await httpClient.GetAsync("/api/Employee/Index");
var json = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
var empList = JsonSerializer.Deserialize<Employee[]>(json);
```

This code will make the same request as before, but it will allow you to inspect the response and see if there are any issues with the deserialization process.

If you're still having issues, please provide more information about the response received from the server and the structure of the `Employee` class.
