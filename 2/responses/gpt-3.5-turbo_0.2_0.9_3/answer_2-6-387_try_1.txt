It seems like the error is related to the missing "Keys" table in the database. This could be caused by a few different things, such as a missing migration or a database schema mismatch.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Ensure that you have applied all the necessary migrations for IdentityServer4 in your project. You can do this by running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Update-Database
```

2. Check that the database schema matches the model schema. You can do this by comparing the database schema with the model schema in your code. If there are any differences, you may need to update the database schema to match the model schema.

3. If the above steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to recreate the database. You can do this by deleting the existing database and running the following command in the Package Manager Console:

```
Update-Database
```

This will create a new database with the latest schema.

Regarding the migration from .NET 5 to 6 for IdentityServer4, there is no specific documentation available yet. However, you can refer to the official Microsoft documentation for migrating from .NET 5 to 6, which may provide some guidance on the process.
