The issue is that the `OnAfterRenderAsync` method is called after the component has rendered, so on the first render, the `tabSet` reference is still null. One solution is to use the `OnInitialized` method to assign the reference to `tabSet` instead of `OnAfterRenderAsync`. Here's how you can modify your code:

```
<TabSet @ref="tabSet">
 ...
</TabSet>

@code {
    private TabSet tabSet;   

    protected override void OnInitialized()
    {
        tabSet.TabChanged += TabChanged;
    }
}
```

This way, the reference to `tabSet` is assigned when the component is initialized, which happens before the first render.
