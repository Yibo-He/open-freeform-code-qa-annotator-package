The code you have provided is not correct for the given problem. It seems like you have tried to solve the problem using a different approach. Here's a correct solution for the problem:

Approach:
- We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem.
- Let's define dp[i][j] as the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for the subarray from i to j.
- We can calculate dp[i][j] as follows:
  - If i == j, then dp[i][j] = 0 (as we need two contiguous subsequences of the same size).
  - Otherwise, we can divide the subarray from i to j into two contiguous subsequences A and B of the same size. Let's say the size of each subsequence is k. Then we can calculate the product of the subsequences as follows:
    - P1 = arr[i] * arr[j]
    - P2 = arr[i+1] * arr[j-1]
    - P3 = arr[i+2] * arr[j-2]
    - ...
    - Pk = arr[i+k-1] * arr[j-k+1]
    - The summation of the product of the boxes for the subarray from i to j will be dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-k] + dp[i+k][j] + P1 + P2 + ... + Pk)
- The answer to the problem will be dp[0][n-1], where n is the number of boxes.

Time Complexity: O(n^3)
Space Complexity: O(n^2)

Here's the implementation of the above approach:

```
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                for (int k = 1; k < len; k++) {
                    int prod = 0;
                    for (int x = i, y = j; x < i + k && y > j - k; x++, y--) {
                        prod += arr[x] * arr[y];
                    }
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-k] + dp[i+k][j] + prod);
                }
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(dp[0][n-1]);
    }
}
```
