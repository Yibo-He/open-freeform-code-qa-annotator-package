It seems like you have set up everything correctly. However, there might be a possibility that the Gradle settings are overriding your project settings. 

To fix this issue, you can add the following lines to your `build.gradle` file:

```
compileJava {
    options.release = 17
}
```

This will ensure that the Java compiler uses Java 17 to compile your code. 

After adding these lines, you can try running your app again. If the issue persists, you can try cleaning and rebuilding your project. 

If none of these solutions work, you can try creating a new project from scratch and following the same steps to set up Java 17. Sometimes, there might be issues with the project configuration that can be resolved by starting fresh.
