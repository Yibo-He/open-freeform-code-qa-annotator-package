It seems like the issue is related to the module cache on computer B. The module cache is where Go stores downloaded modules and their versions. If the module cache is not properly set up or if the modules are not downloaded correctly, it can cause issues like the one you are experiencing.

Here are some steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. Check if the module cache is properly set up on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   go env GOMODCACHE
   ```

   This should output the path to the module cache directory. If the directory does not exist or is not set up correctly, you may need to set it up manually.

2. Check if the module is downloaded correctly on computer B. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   go list -m github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

   This should output information about the module, including its version and dependencies. If the module is not downloaded correctly, you may need to manually download it using the following command:

   ```
   go get github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client@v0.1.5
   ```

3. Check if the module is accessible from computer B. You can do this by trying to access the module's repository URL from computer B using a web browser or a command-line tool like curl. If you cannot access the repository, it may be a network issue or an access issue.

4. Check if the module is using the correct version. It's possible that the module's version has changed since you last downloaded it on computer A. You can check the latest version of the module by running the following command:

   ```
   go list -m -versions github.ibm.com/kms/key-protect-client
   ```

   This should output a list of available versions for the module. If the version you are using is outdated, you may need to update it to the latest version.

I hope these steps help you debug the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
