It seems that the EasyAdminBundle routes are not being loaded. 

You can try to manually import the EasyAdminBundle routes in your `config/routes.yaml` file by adding the following line:

```
# config/routes.yaml

easy_admin_bundle:
    resource: '@EasyAdminBundle/Controller/'
    type: annotation
    prefix: /admin
```

After adding this line, clear the cache and try accessing the `/admin` route again. 

```
symfony console cache:clear
symfony console router:match /admin
```

This should load the EasyAdminBundle routes and you should be able to access the `/admin` route.
