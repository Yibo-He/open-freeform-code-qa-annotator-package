It seems that there might be a conflict between the version of Hibernate Validator that you are using and the version that is being resolved by Maven. You are using Hibernate Validator 5.3.5.Final-redhat-2, but Maven is resolving version 6.0.11.

To resolve this issue, you can try excluding the Hibernate Validator dependency from your Spring Boot starter dependencies and explicitly adding the version that you want to use. Here's an example:

```
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-validation</artifactId>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
            <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hibernate.validator</groupId>
    <artifactId>hibernate-validator</artifactId>
    <version>5.3.5.Final-redhat-2</version>
</dependency>
```

This will exclude the Hibernate Validator dependency from the Spring Boot starter and add the version that you want to use explicitly.

Alternatively, you can try upgrading your Spring Boot version to a version that uses Hibernate Validator 6.x, which might resolve the conflict.
