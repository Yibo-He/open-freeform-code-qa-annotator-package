The @Configuration annotation is used to define a configuration class in Spring. It is used to define beans and their dependencies explicitly. The main benefit of using @Configuration over @Service/@Controller/@Repository is that it allows you to define beans that are not automatically detected by component scanning. This means that you have more control over the creation and configuration of your beans.

Another benefit of using @Configuration is that it allows you to use the @Value annotation to inject values from properties files or environment variables into your beans. This is because the @Value annotation is not supported in @Service/@Controller/@Repository classes.

In addition, @Configuration classes can be used to define complex bean dependencies and configurations that cannot be achieved using @Service/@Controller/@Repository annotations alone. For example, you can use @Configuration classes to define conditional bean creation, bean lifecycle callbacks, and bean post-processors.

Overall, the main benefit of using @Configuration is that it provides more control and flexibility over the creation and configuration of your beans. However, if you have a simple application with straightforward bean dependencies, using @Service/@Controller/@Repository annotations may be sufficient.
