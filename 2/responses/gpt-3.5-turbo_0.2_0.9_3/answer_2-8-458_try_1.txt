It looks like the issue is that the package `project/game` is not located in the `GOROOT` directory. This is because `GOROOT` is the directory where Go is installed, and it should not be used for your own projects.

Instead, you should set your `GOPATH` environment variable to the root directory of your Go projects, which in your case is `C:\Users\ketchup\go`. This is where Go will look for your packages.

Once you have set your `GOPATH` correctly, you should move your `project` directory into `C:\Users\ketchup\go\src`. This will make it so that Go can find your packages when you try to build them.

After you have made these changes, you should be able to build your project without any issues.
