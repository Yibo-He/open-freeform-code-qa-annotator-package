It seems like the EasyAdminBundle routes are not being loaded. 

Make sure that the EasyAdminBundle is enabled in your `config/bundles.php` file. It should look something like this:

```
return [
    // ...
    EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\EasyAdminBundle::class => ['all' => true],
];
```

If the bundle is already enabled, try clearing the cache again with the following commands:

```
symfony console cache:clear
symfony console cache:warmup
```

If that doesn't work, try removing the `var/cache` directory manually and then clearing the cache again:

```
rm -rf var/cache/*
symfony console cache:clear
symfony console cache:warmup
```

If the issue still persists, try checking the logs for any errors that might be related to the EasyAdminBundle. You can find the logs in the `var/log` directory.
