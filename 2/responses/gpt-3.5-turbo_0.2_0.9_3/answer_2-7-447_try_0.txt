To save multiple arrays with separate attributes into the database as a collection, you can use a loop to iterate through each array and create a new Bet model for each set of values. Here's an example of how you can do it in your Laravel controller:

```
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $tw_names = $request->input('tw_name');
    $tw_prices = $request->input('tw_price');

    $bets = collect();

    foreach ($tw_names as $key => $tw_name) {
        $bet = new Bet();
        $bet->name = $tw_name;
        $bet->price = $tw_prices[$key];
        $bets->push($bet);
    }

    Bet::insert($bets->toArray());

    return redirect()->back()->with('success', 'Bets saved successfully.');
}
```

In this example, we first retrieve the `tw_name` and `tw_price` arrays from the request. We then create a new collection to hold our Bet models.

Next, we loop through each `tw_name` value and create a new Bet model for each set of values. We set the `name` attribute to the current `tw_name` value and the `price` attribute to the corresponding `tw_price` value.

We then add each Bet model to our collection using the `push` method.

Finally, we use the `insert` method to insert all of the Bet models into the database at once.

This approach allows you to handle any number of form submissions and save them all as a collection in the database.
