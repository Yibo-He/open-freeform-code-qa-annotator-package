It looks like the issue is with the import path of your `project/game` package. The error message indicates that Go is looking for the package in the GOROOT directory, which is not where your package is located.

To fix this, you need to make sure that the import path for your `project/game` package is correct. In your case, it should be `project/game` since that is the directory structure you have.

You can check the import path in your Go files by looking at the `import` statements. For example, if you have a file `game_stuff.go` in the `project/game` directory, the import statement should look like this:

```
import "project/game/entity"
```

If the import path is incorrect, you can fix it by updating the import statement in your Go files.

Once you have fixed the import path, try building your project again and see if the error goes away.
