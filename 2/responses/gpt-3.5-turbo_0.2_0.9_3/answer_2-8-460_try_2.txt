You can iterate over the map using a `for` loop and print the key-value pairs using string formatting. Here's an example:

```
for key, value := range getUsersAppInfo[0] {
    fmt.Printf("%s value is %v\n", key, value)
}
```

This will output:

```
appId value is 2
fcmServerKey value is keyTestTest
name value is com.app
```

Note that we are accessing the first element of the slice returned by `getUsersAppInfo` because it contains only one map. If there were multiple maps in the slice, you would need to iterate over them as well.
