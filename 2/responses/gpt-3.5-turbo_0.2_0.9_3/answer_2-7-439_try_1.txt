This error message indicates that Composer was unable to install the `ext-zip` extension. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a missing dependency or an incompatible version of the extension.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot the issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Make sure that your PHP version is compatible with the `ext-zip` extension. You can check the required PHP version in the extension's documentation.

2. Check your system requirements: Ensure that your system meets all the requirements for installing the `ext-zip` extension. For example, you may need to install additional libraries or dependencies.

3. Check your Composer configuration: Check your Composer configuration to make sure that it is set up correctly. You can try running `composer diagnose` to check for any issues.

4. Try installing a different version: If the latest version of the `ext-zip` extension is not compatible with your system, try installing an older version instead. You can specify the version number in the `composer require` command, like this: `composer require ext-zip:1.2.3`.

5. Check for conflicts: Check if there are any conflicts with other packages or extensions that you have installed. You can try running `composer why-not ext-zip` to see if there are any conflicts.

If none of these steps work, you may need to seek further assistance from the PHP community or the extension's developers.
