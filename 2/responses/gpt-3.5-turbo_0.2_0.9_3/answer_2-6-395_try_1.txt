To add XML comments to your API endpoints in .NET6, you need to follow these steps:

1. Enable XML documentation generation in your project settings. To do this, right-click on your project in the Solution Explorer, select Properties, and go to the Build tab. Under the Output section, check the "XML documentation file" option and specify a file name.

2. Add XML comments to your API endpoint methods. You can do this by placing triple-slash comments (///) above the method declaration and adding the appropriate tags to describe the method and its parameters. For example:

```
/// <summary>
/// Retrieves a list of clients from the repository.
/// </summary>
/// <param name="repo">The client repository to use.</param>
/// <returns>A list of client models.</returns>
app.MapGet("/clients",
     async (IClientRepository repo) =>
     {
          var results = await repo.GetClientsAsync();
          return mapper.Map<IEnumerable<ClientModel>>(results);
     });
```

3. Build your project to generate the XML documentation file.

4. Configure Swagger to use the XML documentation file. In your Startup.cs file, add the following code to the ConfigureServices method:

```
services.AddSwaggerGen(c =>
{
    c.IncludeXmlComments(Path.Combine(AppContext.BaseDirectory, "YourXmlFileName.xml"));
});
```

Replace "YourXmlFileName.xml" with the name of your XML documentation file.

5. Run your project and navigate to the Swagger UI. You should now see the XML comments displayed in the description section of your API endpoint.
