It seems like IntelliJ is still using the old version of Java (1.8) to compile your application. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that you have set the correct JDK version in IntelliJ. Go to File > Project Structure > SDKs and make sure that the JDK 11 is listed and selected as the default SDK.

2. Check the project settings in IntelliJ. Go to File > Project Structure > Project and make sure that the Project SDK is set to JDK 11.

3. Check the module settings in IntelliJ. Go to File > Project Structure > Modules and make sure that the Language Level is set to 11.

4. If none of the above steps work, try invalidating the cache and restarting IntelliJ. Go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart and select "Invalidate and Restart".

5. If you still have issues, try creating a new project in IntelliJ and see if you can compile it using JDK 11. If it works, then there might be an issue with your current project settings.

6. Lastly, make sure that you have updated your build tools (e.g. Maven, Gradle) to use JDK 11. You can check the build tool documentation for instructions on how to do this.
