In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to build and run your application. Here's an example of how to read the `appsettings.json` file:

1. First, add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting` NuGet package to your project.

2. In your `Program.cs` file, add the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

This code creates a new `HostBuilder` instance and configures it to read the `appsettings.json` file. You can then add your services to the `ConfigureServices` method.

3. Make sure your `appsettings.json` file is in the root of your project and set its "Copy to Output Directory" property to "Copy always" or "Copy if newer".

With these changes, you should be able to read the `appsettings.json` file in your .NET 6 Console Application.
