This error occurs when the Gradle plugin version specified in your project's build.gradle file is not available in any of the repositories that Gradle is searching. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Check your build.gradle file: Make sure that the plugin version specified in your build.gradle file is correct. If it is not correct, update it to the correct version.

2. Check your Gradle version: Make sure that you are using a compatible version of Gradle with the plugin version you are trying to use. You can check the compatibility matrix on the Android Studio website.

3. Check your repositories: Make sure that the repositories you are using in your build.gradle file are correct and up-to-date. You can try adding the Google Maven repository to your build.gradle file:

```
repositories {
    google()
    mavenCentral()
}
```

4. Invalidate caches and restart: Try invalidating caches and restarting Android Studio. This can sometimes fix issues with Gradle sync.

5. Clean and rebuild: Try cleaning your project and rebuilding it. This can sometimes fix issues with Gradle sync.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to try a different version of the Gradle plugin or seek further assistance from the Android Studio community.
