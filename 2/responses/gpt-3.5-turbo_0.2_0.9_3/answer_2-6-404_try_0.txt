In C#, you can add another constructor overload to a record type using the `init` keyword. Here's an example:

```
public record Person(int Id, string FirstName, string LastName)
{
    public Person() : this(0, "", "")
    {
    }
    
    public Person(int id, string firstName, string lastName) : this(id, firstName, lastName)
    {
    }
}
```

In this example, we've added a parameterless constructor that calls the primary constructor with default values. The `init` keyword is used to indicate that the properties can only be set during object initialization, not after.
