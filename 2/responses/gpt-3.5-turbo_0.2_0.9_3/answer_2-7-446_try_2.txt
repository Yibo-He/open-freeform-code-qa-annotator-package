It looks like you have successfully installed Xdebug on your Mac M1. To confirm that Xdebug is installed and working correctly, you can create a PHP file with the following code:

```
<?php
phpinfo();
?>
```

Save the file as `info.php` in your web server's document root directory (e.g., `/Library/WebServer/Documents/`), and then open it in your web browser by going to `http://localhost/info.php`.

You should see a page with information about your PHP installation. Look for the "Xdebug" section to confirm that Xdebug is listed and enabled. If it is, then Xdebug is installed and working correctly.
