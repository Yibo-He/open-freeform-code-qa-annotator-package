The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." indicates that the user running the command does not have sufficient permissions to clear the cache. 

To fix this issue, you can try running the command with elevated privileges by using `sudo`. For example, you can try running the command as follows:

```
sudo php artisan cache:clear
```

This should allow the command to run with the necessary permissions to clear the cache. If you are still encountering issues, you may need to check the file permissions for the cache directory and ensure that the user running the command has the appropriate permissions to modify the files in that directory.
