The issue here is that the properties in the `City` class are defined as fields instead of properties. Fields are not serialized by default in ASP.NET Core, so the response is returning empty objects.

To fix this, you need to change the fields to properties by adding getters and setters to each property in the `City` class:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

After making this change, the response should contain the expected data.
