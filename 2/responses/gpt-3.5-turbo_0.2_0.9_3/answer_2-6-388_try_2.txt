The `[Keyless]` attribute was introduced in Entity Framework Core 5.0. If you are using a version of Entity Framework Core prior to 5.0, you will not have access to this attribute.

To use the `[Keyless]` attribute, you will need to upgrade to Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later. You can do this by updating the `Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore` package in your project to version 5.0 or later.

Once you have upgraded to Entity Framework Core 5.0 or later, you should be able to use the `[Keyless]` attribute to define keyless entity types in your model.
