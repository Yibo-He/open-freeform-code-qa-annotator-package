The error message indicates that the `MetadataAddress` or `Authority` must use HTTPS unless disabled for development by setting `RequireHttpsMetadata=false`. 

In your code, you have set `options.RequireHttpsMetadata = true;`, which means that HTTPS is required. However, in your app service app settings configurations, you have set `AzureAd:Authority` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`, which uses HTTPS. 

One possible reason for this error could be that you have not restarted your app service after setting the app settings configurations. Try restarting your app service and see if the error persists. 

If the error still persists, you can try setting `RequireHttpsMetadata=false` in your code to disable HTTPS requirement for development purposes. However, this is not recommended for production environments.
