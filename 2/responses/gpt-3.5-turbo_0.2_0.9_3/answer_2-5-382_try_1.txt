The error message indicates that there is an issue with resolving an attribute at index 11, which is related to the `activeTrackColor` attribute of the `Slider` view. This could be caused by using an incompatible version of the Material Components library or by not properly defining the attribute in your theme.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Make sure you are using a compatible version of the Material Components library. You can check the latest version on the Material Components for Android website.

2. Define the `activeTrackColor` attribute in your app's theme. Add the following line to your `Theme.MyApplication` style in `themes.xml`:

   ```
   <item name="sliderTrackColorActive">@color/your_color_here</item>
   ```

   Replace `your_color_here` with the desired color value.

3. If the above steps do not work, try cleaning and rebuilding your project.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
