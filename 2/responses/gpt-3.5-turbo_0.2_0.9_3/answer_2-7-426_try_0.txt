The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This can happen if the session is not being maintained properly on the server-side. 

Based on your description, it seems like the issue could be related to the session driver configuration on your host domain. The fact that multiple sessions are being generated for one user suggests that the session is not being maintained properly. 

Here are some things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the session driver configuration on your host domain. Make sure it is set to the same driver as your local environment. If you are using a different driver on your host domain, try switching to the same driver as your local environment.

2. Check the session cookie settings on your host domain. Make sure the domain and path settings are correct. If they are not set correctly, the session cookie may not be sent with each request, causing multiple sessions to be created.

3. Check the server time settings on your host domain. If the server time is not set correctly, it can cause issues with session expiration and token validation.

4. Check for any caching or proxy settings on your host domain. If there is a caching or proxy server between the client and server, it may be caching the CSRF token, causing it to become invalid.

5. Check for any security settings on your host domain that may be blocking or modifying the CSRF token. Some security settings may modify the CSRF token, causing it to become invalid.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
