The issue is with the property key that you are using in the `@Value` annotation. You are using `main.header1.info` instead of `main.header.info`. The correct property key should be `main.header.info` as per the YAML structure you have provided.

So, you can fix the issue by changing the `@Value` annotation as follows:
```
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:data.yml")
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("${main.header.info}")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

This should inject the value of `info` property from the `data.yml` file to the `info` field of `SomeClass`.
