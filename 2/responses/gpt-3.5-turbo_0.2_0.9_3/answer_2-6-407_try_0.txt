It seems like the issue is with the response from the server. The error message indicates that the response starts with a '<' character, which is not valid JSON. 

One possible cause of this issue could be that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON response. You can try to use a tool like Postman to test the API endpoint and see what response you get. 

If the server is indeed returning an HTML error page, you will need to investigate the cause of the error and fix it. If the issue is not related to the server response, you can try to debug the client-side code and see if there are any issues with the HTTP request. 

Here are some steps you can take to debug the client-side code:

1. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the HTTP request and response. This can help you identify any issues with the request or response.

2. Add some logging statements to your client-side code to see if the request is being made correctly and if the response is being parsed correctly.

3. Try using a different HTTP client library, such as HttpClient from the System.Net.Http namespace, to see if the issue is related to the HTTP client library you are using.

4. Check the documentation for Blazor and the HTTP client library you are using to see if there are any known issues or limitations that could be causing the problem.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue with your Blazor application.
