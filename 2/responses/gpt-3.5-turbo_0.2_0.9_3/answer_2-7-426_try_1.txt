The "CSRF token mismatch" error occurs when the CSRF token generated by the server does not match the one sent by the client. This could be due to a number of reasons, including session issues.

Since you have already checked the session configurations and found that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, it is possible that the session driver on the host domain is not configured correctly. 

Here are some things you can try:

1. Check the session driver configuration on the host domain. Make sure it is set to the same driver as on your local environment (e.g. file, database, etc.). 

2. Check the permissions of the `storage` directory on the host domain. Make sure it is writable by the web server user.

3. Clear the session files on the host domain. Sometimes, old session files can cause issues. You can do this by deleting all files in the `storage/framework/sessions` directory.

4. Check if there are any caching mechanisms enabled on the host domain that could be interfering with the session data. 

5. Check if there are any security modules or firewalls on the host domain that could be blocking or modifying the session data.

6. Check if there are any differences in the PHP version or configuration between your local environment and the host domain. 

I hope these suggestions help you resolve the issue. If you continue to experience problems, you may want to consult with your hosting provider or a Laravel expert for further assistance.
