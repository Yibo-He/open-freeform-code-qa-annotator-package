It seems like IntelliJ is still using the old JDK version to compile your application. You can try the following steps to make sure IntelliJ is using the correct JDK version:

1. Go to File > Project Structure > Project and make sure the Project SDK is set to JDK 11.
2. Go to File > Project Structure > Modules and make sure the Language level is set to 11.
3. Go to Run > Edit Configurations and make sure the JRE is set to JDK 11.
4. If none of the above steps work, you can try invalidating the cache and restarting IntelliJ. Go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart and select Invalidate and Restart.

If you still encounter the same error, you can try checking the compiler settings in IntelliJ. Go to File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler and make sure the Target bytecode version is set to 11. 

If none of these steps work, you can try reinstalling JDK 11 and making sure it is properly configured in your system environment variables.
