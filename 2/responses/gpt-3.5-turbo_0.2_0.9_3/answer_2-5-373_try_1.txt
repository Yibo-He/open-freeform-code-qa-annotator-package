It looks like there may be an issue with the permissions or ownership of the database cluster. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check if you have the necessary permissions to create a new database. Make sure you are logged in as a user with the necessary privileges.

2. Check if there are any other processes or applications that may be using the database cluster. If so, try stopping them and then creating the new database.

3. Try restarting the PostgreSQL service or server and then creating the new database.

4. If none of the above steps work, you may need to check the ownership and permissions of the database cluster. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

   `ls -l /var/lib/postgresql/`

   This will show you the ownership and permissions of the PostgreSQL data directory. Make sure that the owner and group are set to the PostgreSQL user and that the permissions are set to 700.

5. If you are still having issues, you may need to consult with a PostgreSQL expert or administrator for further assistance.
