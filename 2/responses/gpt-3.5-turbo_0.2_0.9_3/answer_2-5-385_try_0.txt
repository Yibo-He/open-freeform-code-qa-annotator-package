This error occurs when the Gradle version used by your project is not compatible with the Android Gradle Plugin version. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the Gradle version used by your project. You can find it in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file. The `distributionUrl` property specifies the Gradle version.

2. Check the compatibility of the Gradle version with the Android Gradle Plugin version. You can find the compatibility matrix in the Android Gradle Plugin release notes.

3. If the Gradle version is not compatible, update it to a compatible version. You can do this by changing the `distributionUrl` property in the `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

4. If the compatible Gradle version is not available in your Gradle cache, Gradle will download it automatically.

5. After updating the Gradle version, sync your project with Gradle by clicking on the "Sync Project with Gradle Files" button in the toolbar or by running the `./gradlew clean build` command in the terminal.

If the issue persists, you can try deleting the `.gradle` directory in your project root directory and then syncing your project with Gradle again. This will force Gradle to download all the dependencies again.
