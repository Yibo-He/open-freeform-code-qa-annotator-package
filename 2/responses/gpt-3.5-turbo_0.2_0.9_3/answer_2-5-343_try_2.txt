There seems to be an issue with your code logic. The current implementation is finding the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of different sizes, but the problem requires finding the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of the same size. 

One approach to solve this problem is to use dynamic programming. You can maintain two arrays, left and right, where left[i] stores the maximum sum of a subarray of size i ending at index i, and right[i] stores the maximum sum of a subarray of size i starting at index i. 

Then, you can iterate over all possible subarray sizes k, and for each size, calculate the maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of size k. This can be done by taking the sum of left[i-1] and right[i] for all i from k to n-k, where n is the total number of boxes. 

Finally, you can return the maximum sum obtained over all subarray sizes. 

Here's the modified code:

```
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        
        // calculate left and right arrays
        int[] left = new int[n];
        int[] right = new int[n];
        left[0] = arr[0];
        right[n-1] = arr[n-1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.max(arr[i], left[i-1] + arr[i]);
            right[n-i-1] = Math.max(arr[n-i-1], right[n-i] + arr[n-i-1]);
        }
        
        // calculate maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays of same size
        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int k = 1; k <= n/2; k++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i <= n-2*k; i++) {
                sum = Math.max(sum, left[i+k-1] + right[i+k] + getProduct(arr, i, i+k-1, i+k, i+2*k-1));
            }
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        }
        
        System.out.println(maxSum);
    }
    
    // helper function to calculate product of two subarrays
    private static int getProduct(int[] arr, int start1, int end1, int start2, int end2) {
        int product = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < end1-start1+1; i++) {
            product += arr[start1+i] * arr[start2+end1-start1-i];
        }
        return product;
    }
}
``` 

This should solve the problem for you.
