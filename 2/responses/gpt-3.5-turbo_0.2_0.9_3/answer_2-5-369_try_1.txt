It looks like you are missing the "Local Changes" tab in the Git tool window. To enable it, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Git tool window by clicking on the "Git" tab at the bottom of the screen.
2. Click on the gear icon in the top-right corner of the Git tool window.
3. Select "Local Changes" from the dropdown menu.
4. The "Local Changes" tab should now appear in the Git tool window.

If the "Local Changes" tab still doesn't appear, you can try resetting the tool window layout by clicking on the gear icon and selecting "Restore Default Layout".
