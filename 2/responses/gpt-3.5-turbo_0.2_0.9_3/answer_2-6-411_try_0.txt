If there is nothing to do in the synchronous Dispose() method, you can leave it empty. The async DisposeAsync() method will take care of the cleanup asynchronously. It is not necessary to duplicate the cleanup logic in the synchronous Dispose() method. 

However, you should still call Dispose(false) in the async DisposeAsync() method to ensure that the base class's Dispose(bool) method is called and the disposed flag is set.
