Yes, you have understood the process correctly. Here are the answers to your other questions:

1. Yes, you can use IntelliJ artifacts to create the .jar file. You don't need a specific plugin for that. You can create an artifact by going to File -> Project Structure -> Artifacts -> click on the "+" button -> JAR -> From modules with dependencies. Then select your main class and choose the option to copy the dependencies into the output JAR.

2. No, you don't need to include the dependencies in the .jar file. They will be included in the customized run-time image created by Jlink. However, if you want to distribute your application as a single executable JAR file, you can choose to include the dependencies in the JAR file. This will make the distribution easier, but the file size will be larger.
