The issue is that you are trying to format a `LocalDate` object using a `DateFormat` that expects a `Date` object. You can fix this by converting the `LocalDate` to a `Date` object before formatting it. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:

```
public static String generateRandomDateAndTimeInString() {
    LocalDateTime dateTime = LocalDateTime.now().minus(Duration.ofDays((new Random().nextInt(365 * 70))));
    System.out.println("date and time :: " + dateTime.toString());
    return formatDate(dateTime) ;
}

public static String formatDate(LocalDateTime dateTime){
    DateTimeFormatter formatter = DateTimeFormatter.ofPattern("yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'");
    return dateTime.format(formatter);
}
```

Note that I've changed `LocalDate` to `LocalDateTime`, which includes the time component. I've also changed `DateFormat` to `DateTimeFormatter`, which is the recommended way to format dates and times in Java 8 and later.

With these changes, the output should look something like this:

```
date and time :: 1956-05-10T15:43:27.123456789
1956-05-10T15:43:27Z
```

Note that the `Z` at the end of the formatted string indicates that the time is in UTC. If you want to use a different time zone, you can specify it in the `DateTimeFormatter` using the `withZone` method.
