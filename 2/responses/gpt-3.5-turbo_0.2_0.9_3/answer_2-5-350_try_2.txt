This error occurs when Gradle is unable to access a file because it is already being used by another process. In this case, it seems that Gradle is unable to access the file "gradle-5.6.2-all.zip" because it is being used exclusively by another process.

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Close all instances of VS Code and any other applications that may be using Gradle.

2. Delete the "gradle-5.6.2-all.zip" file from the path "C:\Users\sanjay.gradle\wrapper\dists\gradle-5.6.2-all\9st6wgf78h16so49nn74lgtbb\".

3. Open VS Code and try running the Flutter application again. Gradle will download the file again and this time it should be able to access it without any issues.

If the issue persists, you can try updating Gradle to the latest version or manually downloading the Gradle distribution and setting the path in your project's Gradle settings.
