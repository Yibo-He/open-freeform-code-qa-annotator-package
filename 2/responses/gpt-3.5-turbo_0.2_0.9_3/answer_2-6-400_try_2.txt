This error usually occurs when the A.dll file is still in use by another process, in this case, Visual Studio. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Close all instances of Visual Studio and try building your application again.

2. Check if any other application is using the A.dll file. If yes, close that application and try building your application again.

3. Try deleting the A.dll file manually from the "..\..\bin\" folder and then rebuild your application. This should force Visual Studio to create a new A.dll file.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a tool like Process Explorer to find out which process is using the A.dll file and then terminate that process.

5. Another solution is to use a tool like Unlocker to unlock the A.dll file and then try building your application again.

6. You can also try disabling the "Enable Edit and Continue" option in Visual Studio. To do this, go to Tools > Options > Debugging > General and uncheck the "Enable Edit and Continue" option.

I hope one of these solutions works for you.
