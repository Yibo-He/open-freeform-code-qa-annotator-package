You can use the `now()` function in MySQL to store the current date time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields. Here's how you can modify your code:

```
function insert(Request $req)
{
    $name = $req->input('name');
    $address = $req->input('address');
    $data = array("name" => $name, "address" => $address, "created_at" => now(), "updated_at" => now());
    DB::table('student')->insert($data);
    echo "Record inserted successfully.<br/>";
    return redirect('/');
}
```

This will store the current date time in the `created_at` and `updated_at` fields in the database.
