The error message indicates that the `MetadataAddress` or `Authority` used for authentication must use HTTPS unless disabled for development by setting `RequireHttpsMetadata=false`. 

In your code, you have set `options.RequireHttpsMetadata = true;` which means that HTTPS is required. However, in your app service app settings configurations, you have set `AzureAd:Authority` to `https://login.microsoftonline.com/` which uses HTTP instead of HTTPS.

To fix this issue, you need to update the `AzureAd:Authority` value to use HTTPS instead of HTTP. The correct value should be `https://login.microsoftonline.com/`. Once you have updated the value, restart your app service and try again.
