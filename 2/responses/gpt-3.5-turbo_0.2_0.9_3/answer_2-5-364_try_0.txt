If you want to use the same version of Java that is used by the Maven task, you can try setting the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the path of the Java installation used by the Maven task. 

To find the path of the Java installation used by the Maven task, you can run the following command in your project directory:

```
mvn -version
```

This will display the version of Maven and the path of the Java installation used by Maven. You can then set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to this path.

On Windows, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by following these steps:

1. Open the Start menu and search for "Environment Variables".
2. Click on "Edit the system environment variables".
3. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.
4. Under "System Variables", click on "New".
5. Enter "JAVA_HOME" as the variable name and the path to the Java installation as the variable value.
6. Click "OK" to save the changes.

On Linux or macOS, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by adding the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
```

Replace `/path/to/java` with the path to the Java installation used by Maven. 

Once you have set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, try running the Maven wrapper again and it should use the correct version of Java.
