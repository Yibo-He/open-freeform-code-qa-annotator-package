Starting from Spring Boot 2.4.0, the behavior of `spring.profiles.include` has changed. Previously, it was possible to include profiles at runtime using this property, but now it only includes profiles during the application context initialization.

To achieve the same result as before migration, you can use the `spring.config.activate.on-profile` property instead. This property activates the specified profiles during the application context initialization and at runtime.

Here is an example of how you can configure your profiles using `spring.config.activate.on-profile`:

```
# Profiles
spring.config.activate.on-profile=auth,dev
```

This configuration activates both `auth` and `dev` profiles during the application context initialization and at runtime.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
