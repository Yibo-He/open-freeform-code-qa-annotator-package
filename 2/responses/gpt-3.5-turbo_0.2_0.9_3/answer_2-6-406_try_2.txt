In a .NET 6 Console Application, you can use the `Host` class to read the appsettings.json file. Here's an example of how to do it:

1. Add the following NuGet packages to your project:
   - Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting
   - Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json

2. In your `Program.cs` file, add the following code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using Microsoft.Extensions.Hosting;

var builder = new HostBuilder()
    .ConfigureAppConfiguration((hostingContext, config) =>
    {
        config.AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true);
    })
    .ConfigureServices((hostContext, services) =>
    {
        // Add your services here
    });

await builder.RunConsoleAsync();
```

This code creates a `HostBuilder` instance and configures it to read the `appsettings.json` file. You can then add your services to the `ConfigureServices` method.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
