It looks like you are trying to create a new database with the name "eCommerce" but there may already be a database with that name or there may be some other issue with the database server.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if there is already a database with the name "eCommerce". You can do this by expanding the "Databases" section in the left-hand panel of pgAdmin and looking for the database name.

2. If there is a database with that name, try deleting it first before creating a new one. You can do this by right-clicking on the database name and selecting "Delete/Drop".

3. If you are still unable to create a new database, try restarting the PostgreSQL server and then try creating the database again.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to check the PostgreSQL logs for any error messages that could be causing the issue.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
