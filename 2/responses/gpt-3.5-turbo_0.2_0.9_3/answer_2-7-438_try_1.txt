It looks like you are using the correct format for rolling back a migration, but the error message suggests that DoctrineMigrationsBundle is not able to find the migration class.

One possible reason for this could be that the namespace of the migration class is not correct. In your `doctrine_migrations` configuration, you have specified the migrations path as `'Application\Migrations': 'app/DoctrineMigrations'`. This means that the namespace for your migration classes should be `Application\Migrations`.

Based on the name of the migration class (`Version20210909072642`), it seems like the namespace should be `Application\Migrations`. However, in your rollback commands, you are using different namespaces (`Application\DoctrineMigrations` and `Version20210909072642`). This could be causing the class not to be found.

To fix this, try running the rollback command with the correct namespace:

```
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 'Application\Migrations\Version20210909072642' --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

This should locate the migration class and execute the rollback.
