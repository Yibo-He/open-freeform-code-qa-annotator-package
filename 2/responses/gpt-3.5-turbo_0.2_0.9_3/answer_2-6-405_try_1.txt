The issue seems to be with the `City` model class. The properties of the `City` class are defined as public fields instead of public properties. When the JSON serializer tries to serialize the `City` objects, it only serializes properties and not fields. Therefore, the response contains empty objects.

To fix this issue, you need to change the public fields to public properties in the `City` class. Here's how you can modify the `City` class:

```
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; }
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

After making this change, the JSON serializer will be able to serialize the `City` objects properly, and you should get the expected response.
