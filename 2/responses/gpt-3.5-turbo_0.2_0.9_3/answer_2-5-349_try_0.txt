To send a path variable in a POST mapping using Postman, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Set the request method to POST.
3. Enter the URL of the API endpoint, including the path variable in curly braces. For example: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/{code}`
4. Click on the "Body" tab and select "raw".
5. Select the data format you want to use (JSON, XML, etc.).
6. Enter the request body in the format you selected.
7. Click on the "Send" button to send the request.

In your code, the `@PathVariable` annotation is used to extract the value of the path variable from the URL and map it to the `code` parameter of the `postRequest` method. The `@RequestBody` annotation is used to map the request body to the `dto` parameter of the method.
