This error occurs when there is a version mismatch between the Gradle plugin and the Gradle version used in the project. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the Gradle version used in your project by opening the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file and looking for the `distributionUrl` property. It should look something like this: `distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.0-all.zip`

2. Make sure that the Gradle plugin version in your project's `build.gradle` file matches the Gradle version used in your project. For example, if your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file specifies Gradle version 5.0, then your `build.gradle` file should have the following line: `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.2.1'`

3. If the Gradle plugin version in your `build.gradle` file is correct, try cleaning and rebuilding your project. You can do this by selecting "Clean Project" from the "Build" menu in Android Studio, followed by "Rebuild Project".

4. If the above steps do not work, try deleting the `.gradle` directory in your project's root directory and then rebuilding your project. This will force Gradle to download all dependencies again.

5. If none of the above steps work, try downgrading the Gradle plugin version in your `build.gradle` file to a lower version that is compatible with your Gradle version. You can find a list of compatible versions in the Gradle plugin release notes.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.
