The error message you are seeing indicates that the JSON returned from the server is not valid. The '<' character at the beginning of the response suggests that the server is returning an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON data.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Verify that the API endpoint is returning valid JSON data by testing it with a tool like Postman or curl.

2. Check the network tab in your browser's developer tools to see the response from the server. Look for any error messages or unexpected content.

3. Make sure that the URL you are using to call the API is correct and matches the route defined in your controller.

4. Check the server logs for any errors or exceptions that may be causing the issue.

5. If you are using authentication or authorization in your application, make sure that the user has the necessary permissions to access the API endpoint.

6. If none of the above steps resolve the issue, try simplifying your code to isolate the problem. For example, you can try calling a different API endpoint or using a different HTTP method to see if the issue persists.

Once you have identified the root cause of the issue, you can take steps to fix it. This may involve modifying your API endpoint, updating your Blazor code, or making changes to your server configuration.
