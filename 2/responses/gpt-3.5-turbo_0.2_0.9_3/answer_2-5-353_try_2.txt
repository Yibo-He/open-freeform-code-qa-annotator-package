Starting from Spring Boot 2.4.0, the behavior of `spring.profiles.include` property has changed. It no longer includes the specified profiles at runtime. Instead, it only includes them during the configuration phase.

To achieve the same result as before migration, you can use the `spring.profiles.active` property to activate the `auth` profile at runtime. Here's how you can modify your `application-dev.properties` file:

```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.active=dev,auth
```

This will activate both the `dev` and `auth` profiles at runtime. You can also set the `spring.profiles.active` property as an environment variable or a command-line argument when running your application.

Alternatively, you can use profile groups to achieve the same result. Here's an example:

```
# Profiles    
spring.profiles.groups=dev,auth
```

This will activate both the `dev` and `auth` profiles at runtime. However, note that profile groups are deprecated in Spring Boot 2.4.0 and will be removed in a future release. Therefore, it's recommended to use the `spring.profiles.active` property instead.
