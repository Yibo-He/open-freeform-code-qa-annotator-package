It seems like the issue is with the content type of the response. The error message suggests that there is no converter for the `Pet` class with the preset content type of `null`. 

You can try specifying the content type of the response explicitly in the `@RequestMapping` annotation, like this:

```
@RequestMapping(value = "/pet/{petId}", produces = {"application/json", "application/xml"})
```

This should tell Spring to use the appropriate converter for the specified content types.

If that doesn't work, you can try adding a message converter explicitly to your Spring configuration. For example, if you want to support XML responses, you can add the following to your `WebMvcConfigurer` implementation:

```
@Configuration
public class WebConfig implements WebMvcConfigurer {

    @Override
    public void configureMessageConverters(List<HttpMessageConverter<?>> converters) {
        converters.add(new MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter());
    }
}
```

This will add a converter that can convert `Pet` objects to XML.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
