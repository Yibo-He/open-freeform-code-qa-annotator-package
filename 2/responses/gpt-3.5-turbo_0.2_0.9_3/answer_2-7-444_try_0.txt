To get the current user's role who is logged in using Spatie/Roles in Laravel, you can use the `auth()->user()` method to get the authenticated user and then use the `hasRole()` method to check if the user has a specific role.

Here's an example:

```
if(auth()->user()->hasRole('admin')) {
    // Do something for admin users
} else {
    // Do something for non-admin users
}
```

Make sure that you have properly set up the Spatie/Roles package in your Laravel application and have assigned roles to your users.
