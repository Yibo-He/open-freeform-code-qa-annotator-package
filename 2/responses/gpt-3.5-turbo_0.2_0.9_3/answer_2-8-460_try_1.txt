You can loop through the map and print the key-value pairs as follows:

```
for key, value := range getUsersAppInfo[0] {
    fmt.Printf("%s value is %v\n", key, value)
}
```

This will output:

```
appId value is 2
fcmServerKey value is keyTestTest
name value is com.app
``` 

If you want to include the key name in the value output for the fcmServerKey, you can modify the print statement as follows:

```
for key, value := range getUsersAppInfo[0] {
    if key == "fcmServerKey" {
        fmt.Printf("%s:%v value is %v\n", key, value, value)
    } else {
        fmt.Printf("%s value is %v\n", key, value)
    }
}
```

This will output:

```
appId value is 2
fcmServerKey:keyTestTest value is keyTestTest
name value is com.app
```
