The error message is indicating that you cannot use the `Gender` property as an index on the `User` entity because it is already configured as a navigation property. 

To fix this error, you can remove the `user.HasIndex(x => x.Gender);` line from your `OnModelCreating` method. This line is not necessary because the `GenderId` property is already being used as a foreign key to link the `User` and `Gender` entities.

Here is the updated `OnModelCreating` method:

```
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);
    }
}
``` 

After making this change, you should be able to run `dotnet ef add migration User` without any errors.
