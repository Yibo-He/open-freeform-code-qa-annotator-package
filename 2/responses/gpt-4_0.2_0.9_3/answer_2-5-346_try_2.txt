The error message `Cause: error: invalid source release: 17` indicates that Gradle is trying to compile your code with a version of Java that doesn't support Java 17. 

The `sourceCompatibility` in your `build.gradle` file is set to '17', which means you want to compile your code with Java 17. However, it seems that Gradle itself is not running with Java 17.

To fix this, you need to ensure that Gradle is using Java 17. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Gradle settings in IntelliJ IDEA. You can find it under `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Gradle`.

2. Under the `Gradle JVM` option, select your `17` version of Java. If it's not listed, you can add it by clicking on the `...` button and pointing it to your Java 17 installation directory.

3. Click `OK` to save the settings.

4. Try to build your project again.

If you're running Gradle from the command line, you can set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to your Java 17 installation directory. You can do this in your terminal:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/your/java17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/java17` with the actual path to your Java 17 installation directory. After setting `JAVA_HOME`, you can run your Gradle build again.
