The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function, which means it's not being imported correctly. 

In your code, you're using destructuring assignment to import `expressJwt` from the `express-jwt` module. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with properties. 

So, you should change your import statement from:

```javascript
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt');
```

to:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This should resolve the TypeError you're encountering.
