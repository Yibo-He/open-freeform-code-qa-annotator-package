The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI. Starting from version 1.3.9 of springdoc-openapi-ui, the Swagger UI is accessible through the path /swagger-ui/index.html instead of /swagger-ui.html.

So, try accessing Swagger UI at `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you still face issues, make sure you have the following:

1. Check if you have the correct Spring Boot version. The springdoc-openapi-ui library works with Spring Boot 2.0.0.RELEASE and later.

2. Make sure you have the springdoc-openapi-ui dependency in your pom.xml file.

3. If you have any custom security configurations, make sure they don't block the Swagger UI URL.

4. If you're using SpringFox, ensure it's disabled as it can conflict with SpringDoc.

5. If you're using Spring MVC (not WebFlux), you also need to add the springdoc-openapi-webmvc-core dependency.

6. If you're using servlet container, make sure it's Servlet 3.0+ compatible.

7. If you're using Spring Boot with Jersey, you need to add the springdoc-openapi-jersey2 dependency.

8. If none of the above helps, try to create a minimal, reproducible example of your problem. This will help you isolate the issue and might even lead you to the solution.
