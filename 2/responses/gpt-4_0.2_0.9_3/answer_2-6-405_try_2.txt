The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the properties in your `City` class are defined as fields, not properties. The JSON serializer in .NET Core does not serialize fields, it only serializes properties. 

You can resolve this issue by converting your fields into properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In this code, I've added `{ get; set; }` to each field, converting them into properties. Now, when you return a list of `City` objects from your API, the JSON serializer will include the properties in the serialized JSON.
