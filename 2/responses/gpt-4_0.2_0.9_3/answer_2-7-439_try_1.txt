The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means that it needs to be installed on your PHP environment, not via Composer.

If you are using a Unix-like operating system, you can install the `zip` extension with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

If you are using Windows, you can enable the extension by editing your `php.ini` file:

1. Open your `php.ini` file (you can find its location by running `php --ini`).
2. Find the line `;extension=zip`.
3. Uncomment this line by removing the semicolon at the start.
4. Save the `php.ini` file.
5. Restart your web server.

After installing or enabling the `zip` extension, you should be able to use the `ZipArchive` class in your PHP code.

If you still see the warning in PHPStorm, you may need to update PHPStorm's interpreter settings to make sure it's using the correct PHP version.

If you're using Docker, you'll need to ensure the `zip` extension is installed in the Docker image you're using for your PHP environment. This will depend on the specific image you're using, but in a Dockerfile it might look something like this:

```Dockerfile
RUN docker-php-ext-install zip
```
