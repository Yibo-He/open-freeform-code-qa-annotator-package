The error message you're seeing indicates that the SQLite database you're using doesn't have a table named "Keys". This table is used by IdentityServer4 to store keys for signing tokens.

When you upgraded to .NET 6.0, it's possible that the database schema required by IdentityServer4 has changed, and you need to update your database to match the new schema.

Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:

1. **Create a Migration**: If you're using Entity Framework Core, you can create a new migration that will generate the necessary table. In your terminal, navigate to the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef migrations add UpdateIdentityServer4
```

This will create a new migration file in your project. Review the file to ensure it's creating the "Keys" table.

2. **Update the Database**: After creating the migration, you can apply it to the database by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This will apply all pending migrations to the database, including the one you just created.

3. **Check the Documentation**: If you're still having issues, check the official IdentityServer4 documentation. While there might not be a specific guide for migrating from .NET 5 to .NET 6, the documentation might have information on changes to the database schema.

4. **Consider Upgrading to Duende IdentityServer**: IdentityServer4 is no longer being maintained, and the team behind it has moved to a new project called Duende IdentityServer. If you're planning to use IdentityServer in a production environment, you might want to consider migrating to Duende IdentityServer. They have a migration guide available on their website.

Remember to always backup your database before performing any operations that might modify its structure or data.
