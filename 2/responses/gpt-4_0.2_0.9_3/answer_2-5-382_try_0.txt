The error message `Failed to resolve attribute at index 11: TypedValue{t=0x2/d=0x7f0300b4 a=3}` indicates that there is an attribute in your XML layout that the `Slider` class is unable to resolve. 

The issue is likely due to the version of the Material Components library you are using. The `Slider` class was introduced in version `1.2.0-alpha05` of the Material Components library. However, you are using version `1.2.0-alpha02`, which may not have the `Slider` class or may have an incomplete or buggy implementation of it.

To fix this issue, you should update the Material Components library to a stable version that includes the `Slider` class. The latest stable version at the time of writing is `1.3.0`.

Change this line in your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.2.0-alpha02'
```

to:

```gradle
implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.3.0'
```

Then sync your project with Gradle files.

If you still encounter the rendering problem with the Navigation Drawer Layout, you should try to fix that problem separately, instead of downgrading the Material Components library to a version that does not include the `Slider` class.
