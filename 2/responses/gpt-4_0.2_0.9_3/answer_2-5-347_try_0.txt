The error message you're seeing suggests that there are conflicts in the installation area that the patch cannot resolve. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as file permissions, corrupted files, or issues with the previous installation.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Backup your settings**: Before you start, make sure to backup your settings in IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by going to `File > Manage IDE Settings > Export Settings`.

2. **Uninstall the current version**: Uninstall the current version of IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    sudo apt-get remove intellij-idea-community
    ```
    Replace `intellij-idea-community` with `intellij-idea-ultimate` if you're using the ultimate version.

3. **Delete the IntelliJ IDEA directory**: Delete the IntelliJ IDEA directory to ensure that there are no remaining files that could cause conflicts. The directory is usually located in your home directory under `~/.IntelliJIdea<version>`. You can delete it by running the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    rm -rf ~/.IntelliJIdea<version>
    ```
    Replace `<version>` with your current IntelliJ IDEA version.

4. **Download the new version**: Download the new version of IntelliJ IDEA from the official JetBrains website.

5. **Install the new version**: Install the new version by following the instructions provided by JetBrains. If you downloaded a `.tar.gz` file, you can extract it using the following command in the terminal:
    ```
    tar -xzf idea-<version>.tar.gz
    ```
    Replace `<version>` with the version you downloaded. Then, navigate to the `bin` directory in the extracted folder and run the `idea.sh` script to start IntelliJ IDEA.

6. **Restore your settings**: Finally, restore your settings in IntelliJ IDEA by going to `File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings`.

If you're still having issues after following these steps, it might be a good idea to reach out to JetBrains support for further assistance.
