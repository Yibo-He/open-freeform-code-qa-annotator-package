The error message indicates that the migration class "20210909072642" was not found. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The migration class does not exist in the specified path.
2. The migration class exists but is not named correctly.
3. The migration class exists and is named correctly, but the namespace is incorrect.

Based on your Doctrine configuration, your migrations are located in the 'app/DoctrineMigrations' directory and the namespace for your migrations is 'Application\Migrations'. Therefore, the migration class should be located at 'app/DoctrineMigrations/Version20210909072642.php' and the class should be named 'Version20210909072642' with the namespace 'Application\Migrations'.

To execute a migration, you should use the version number only, without the namespace. So your command should look like this:

```bash
bin/console --env=dev doctrine:migrations:execute 20210909072642 --down --no-interaction -vvv
```

If you're still having issues, check the following:

1. Make sure the 'app/DoctrineMigrations/Version20210909072642.php' file exists.
2. Open the 'app/DoctrineMigrations/Version20210909072642.php' file and make sure the class is named 'Version20210909072642' and the namespace is 'Application\Migrations'.
3. Clear the cache using the command `bin/console cache:clear`. Sometimes the cache can cause issues with finding the migration classes.
4. Make sure you have installed all the necessary dependencies and that the DoctrineMigrationsBundle is correctly configured.

If none of the above solutions work, it might be a bug in the DoctrineMigrationsBundle. In this case, you should report the issue to the Doctrine project.
