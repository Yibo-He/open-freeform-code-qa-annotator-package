The error you're seeing is likely due to a mismatch between the versions of Spring Boot and Spring Cloud you're using. 

Spring Cloud releases are built against specific Spring Boot versions, and using mismatched versions can lead to the kind of error you're seeing. 

In your case, you're using Spring Boot 2.4.0 and Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR8. According to the Spring Cloud [version matrix](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview), Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR8 is built to work with Spring Boot 2.2.x and 2.3.x, not 2.4.x.

To fix this, you have two options:

1. Downgrade your Spring Boot version to 2.3.x. This would involve changing the version in your `pom.xml` file to something like 2.3.8.RELEASE, which is the latest 2.3.x version at the time of writing.

2. Upgrade your Spring Cloud version to 2020.0.x (also known as Ilford), which is built to work with Spring Boot 2.4.x. This would involve changing the `spring-cloud.version` property in your `pom.xml` file to something like 2020.0.1 (the latest version at the time of writing).

Here's how you can change the Spring Cloud version:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>15</java.version>
    <maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target>
    <maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source>
    <spring-cloud.version>2020.0.1</spring-cloud.version>
</properties>
```

Remember to run `mvn clean install` after changing the `pom.xml` file to ensure that the changes take effect.
