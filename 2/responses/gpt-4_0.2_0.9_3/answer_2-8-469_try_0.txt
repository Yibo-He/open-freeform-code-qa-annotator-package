The error message is indicating that the `protoc-gen-go` tool is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. This is because the `go_package` option is not specified in your .proto source file.

The `go_package` option is a way to specify the full Go import path of the package. It is used as the package clause in the generated Go file.

You can fix this issue by adding a `go_package` option to your `proto` file. Here's how you can do it:

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "main";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2; 
}
```

In this case, `main` is the name of the Go package where the generated Go file will be placed. 

After making this change, you should be able to generate the Go code without any issues.

If you want to specify a full path, you can do so like this:

```protobuf
option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/yourpackage";
```

This would be useful if you're working in a larger project where the Go code might be imported from different places.
