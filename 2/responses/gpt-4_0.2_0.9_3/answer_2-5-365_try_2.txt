The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function. This is likely because of how you're importing it.

You're using destructuring assignment to import `expressJwt`:

```javascript
const { expressJwt } = require('express-jwt');
```

This would work if `express-jwt` exported an object with a property named `expressJwt`. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with properties.

You should import `expressJwt` like this:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This way, you're assigning the function exported by `express-jwt` directly to the `expressJwt` variable.
