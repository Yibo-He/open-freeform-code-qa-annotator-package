Your code is not considering all possible pairs of subsequences. It is only considering pairs of subsequences that are adjacent to each other. However, the problem statement does not require the subsequences to be adjacent. They only need to be disjoint. 

Here is a Python solution that considers all possible pairs of subsequences. It uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for all possible pairs of subsequences.

```python
def max_sum_product(arr, n):
    prefix = [0]*(n+1)
    suffix = [0]*(n+1)
    dp = [[0]*(n+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        prefix[i] = prefix[i-1] + arr[i-1]
        dp[i][i] = max(dp[i-1][i], arr[i-1])
        
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        suffix[i] = suffix[i+1] + arr[i-1]
        dp[i][i] = max(dp[i][i+1], arr[i-1])
        
    for length in range(2, n+1):
        for i in range(1, n-length+2):
            j = i+length-1
            dp[i][j] = max(prefix[j]-prefix[i-1], suffix[i]-suffix[j+1])
            for k in range(i, j):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
                
    return dp[1][n]

n = int(input())
arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(max_sum_product(arr, n))
```

This solution calculates the prefix and suffix sums of the array. It then uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for all possible pairs of subsequences. The dp[i][j] stores the maximum summation of the product of the boxes for the subsequence from i to j. The solution iterates over all possible lengths of subsequences and for each length, it iterates over all possible starting points of the subsequence. For each subsequence, it calculates the maximum summation of the product of the boxes by considering all possible pairs of subsequences within the current subsequence. The final answer is stored in dp[1][n].
