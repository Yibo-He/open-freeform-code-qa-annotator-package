You can use a loop to iterate over the arrays and create a new Bet for each pair of name and price. Here's an example of how you can do this in your Laravel controller:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $names = $request->get('tw_name');
    $prices = $request->get('tw_price');

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($names); $i++) {
        Bet::create([
            'name' => $names[$i],
            'price' => $prices[$i],
        ]);
    }

    // redirect or return response
}
```

In this code, we're getting the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays from the request. Then we're looping over these arrays and for each iteration, we're creating a new Bet with the corresponding name and price.

Please note that this code assumes that the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays have the same length. If they don't, this could result in an error. You might want to add some error checking to handle this case.
