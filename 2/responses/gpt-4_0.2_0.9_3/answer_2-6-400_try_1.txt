This issue can occur when Visual Studio or another process is still using the DLL file when you try to build your project. Here are some solutions you can try:

1. **Clean Solution**: Before building your solution, try cleaning it first. Go to `Build > Clean Solution` and then try to build your solution again.

2. **Close Other Applications**: Make sure no other applications are using the DLL file. This includes other instances of Visual Studio, IIS, or any other application that might be using your DLL.

3. **Disable Antivirus Software**: Sometimes, antivirus software can lock files. Try disabling your antivirus software temporarily and see if the problem persists.

4. **Unlock DLL File**: You can use a tool like Process Explorer to find out which process is locking the DLL file. Once you find the process, you can kill it to unlock the DLL file.

5. **Delete obj Folder**: Try deleting the obj folder in your project directory and then rebuild your project.

6. **Update Visual Studio**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Visual Studio. This issue might be a bug that has been fixed in a newer version.

7. **Use MSBuild**: Try using MSBuild from the command line to build your project. This can sometimes avoid issues that occur within the Visual Studio IDE.

Remember to always backup your project before trying these solutions. If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider contacting Microsoft Support for further assistance.
