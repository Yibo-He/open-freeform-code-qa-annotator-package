`@RequiredArgsConstructor` is a Lombok annotation that generates a constructor with required arguments. Required arguments are final fields and fields with constraints such as @NonNull that need to be initialized.

`@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))` is a variant of the `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotation that additionally adds the `@Inject` annotation to the generated constructor. 

The `@Inject` annotation is a standard Java annotation defined by JSR 330, which specifies APIs for dependency injection. It's used to automatically inject dependencies into an object. 

So, the difference between the two is that the latter one is used when you want the generated constructor to be used for dependency injection.
