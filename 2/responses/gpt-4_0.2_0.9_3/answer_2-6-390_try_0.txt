The error message "The issuer is invalid" indicates that the issuer of the token is not trusted by your API. This usually happens when the issuer URL in the token does not match the authority URL configured in your API.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure the `identityUrl` configured in your API matches the issuer URL in the token. You can decode your token using a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/) and check the `iss` claim.

2. If you're using different environments (like local, staging, production), ensure that the correct `identityUrl` is used for each environment.

3. If you're using IdentityServer4, make sure the API resource name (`apiName`) matches the one configured in IdentityServer.

4. If you're testing locally, ensure that your IdentityServer and API are running on the correct ports and that those ports are correctly configured in your `identityUrl`.

5. Make sure the token is not expired.

6. Ensure that the token is passed correctly in the Authorization header in the format `Bearer your_token_here`.

If everything seems correct and you're still facing the issue, you might want to enable detailed logging in your API to get more information about why the token validation is failing.
