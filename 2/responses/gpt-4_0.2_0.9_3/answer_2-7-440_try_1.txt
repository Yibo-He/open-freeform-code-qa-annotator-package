The error you're encountering is because the `Input` facade was removed in Laravel 6.0. You should replace any usage of the `Input` facade with a `Request` facade instead.

For example, if you were using `Input::get('key')`, you should replace it with `Request::input('key')`.

If you're using `Input::all()`, you should replace it with `Request::all()`.

So, you need to replace `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Input;` with `use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request;` in your code.

If you're using `Input` in a lot of places, you might consider adding an alias for it in your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'aliases' => [
    // ...
    'Input' => Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request::class,
    // ...
],
```

This will allow you to use `Input::` as you did before, but it will be using the `Request` facade under the hood.
