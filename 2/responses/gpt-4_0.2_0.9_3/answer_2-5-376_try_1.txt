The error message "invalid target release: 11" means that the Java compiler version that IntelliJ IDEA is using does not support Java 11. 

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the Project SDK**: Go to `File > Project Structure > Project` and check the `Project SDK` field. It should be set to your installed JDK 11. If it's not, change it to JDK 11.

2. **Check the Module SDK**: In the same `Project Structure` window, go to `Modules`, select your module, and check the `Module SDK` field. It should also be set to JDK 11. If it's not, change it to JDK 11.

3. **Check the Java Compiler version**: Go to `File > Settings > Build, Execution, Deployment > Compiler > Java Compiler` and check the `Target bytecode version` for your module. It should be set to 11. If it's not, change it to 11.

4. **Check the Maven Compiler Plugin**: If you're using Maven, check the configuration of the Maven Compiler Plugin in your `pom.xml` file. It should look something like this:

```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.8.0</version>
    <configuration>
        <source>11</source>
        <target>11</target>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```

5. **Check the Gradle Java version**: If you're using Gradle, check the Java version in your `build.gradle` file. It should look something like this:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = '11'
targetCompatibility = '11'
```

As for the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions only. The JRE is essentially a subset of the JDK and its use is not recommended for most development scenarios. So it's normal to see only the JDK folder for Java 11.

If you've checked all these settings and you're still getting the error, you might need to restart IntelliJ IDEA or invalidate the caches (`File > Invalidate Caches / Restart...`) to make sure the changes take effect.
