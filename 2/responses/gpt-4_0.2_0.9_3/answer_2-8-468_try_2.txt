In Go, you can convert an integer to its ASCII representation using the `rune` type. However, you're trying to convert a string to a rune, which is causing the error. 

If you want to convert an integer to its ASCII representation, you should do it like this:

```go
a := 49
fmt.Println(string(a)) // gives 1
```

In this case, `a` is an integer, and you're converting it to its ASCII representation using the `string` function.

If you want to convert a string containing a number to its ASCII representation, you should first convert the string to an integer:

```go
a := "49"
i, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
} else {
    fmt.Println(string(i)) // gives 1
}
```

In this case, `strconv.Atoi` is used to convert the string to an integer, and then the integer is converted to its ASCII representation.
