The issue you're encountering is likely due to your PHP version not being compatible with Laravel 9. Laravel 9 requires PHP 8.0 or higher. 

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Check your PHP version: Run `php -v` in your terminal. If your PHP version is below 8.0, you need to upgrade it.

2. Upgrade PHP: If you're using a Linux-based OS, you can upgrade PHP by running the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ondrej/php
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install php8.0
```

If you're using Windows, you can download the latest PHP version from the official PHP website and install it.

3. Set PHP 8.0 as default: If you have multiple PHP versions installed, make sure to set PHP 8.0 as your default version. On Linux, you can do this by running `sudo update-alternatives --set php /usr/bin/php8.0`

4. Check Composer version: Make sure you're using Composer 2.0 or higher. You can check this by running `composer --version`. If you're using an older version, you can upgrade it by running `composer self-update`.

5. Try installing Laravel 9 again: Now, you should be able to install Laravel 9 by running `composer create-project laravel/laravel blog "9.*"`

Remember to replace `blog` with the name of your project. If you're still encountering issues, please let me know.
