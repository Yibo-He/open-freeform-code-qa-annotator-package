This error is usually caused by a compatibility issue between the Gradle version and the Android Gradle Plugin version. 

The error message `java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.jetbrains.plugins.gradle.tooling.util.ModuleComponentIdentifierImpl.getModuleIdentifier()Lorg/gradle/api/artifacts/ModuleIdentifier;` suggests that the Android Gradle Plugin is calling a method that does not exist in the version of Gradle you're using.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Android Studio version**: Make sure you're using the latest stable version of Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in Android Studio.

2. **Update your Android Gradle Plugin**: In your project-level `build.gradle` file, make sure you're using a version of the Android Gradle Plugin that is compatible with Gradle 5.0. For example:

    ```groovy
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.2'
    }
    ```

    You can check the compatibility between Gradle and Android Gradle Plugin versions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle).

3. **Update your Gradle Wrapper**: In your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file, make sure you're using Gradle 5.0:

    ```properties
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.0-all.zip
    ```

4. **Sync your project**: After making these changes, click on `File > Sync Project with Gradle Files` in Android Studio.

If the problem persists, you might want to consider downgrading your Gradle version to the one that was working before. You can do this by changing the `distributionUrl` in your `gradle-wrapper.properties` file to the previous version:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-4.10.1-all.zip
```

And then sync your project again.
