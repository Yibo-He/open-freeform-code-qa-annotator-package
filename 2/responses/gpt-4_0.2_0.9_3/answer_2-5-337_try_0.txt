In Android Studio (or IntelliJ), you can use the following shortcut to extract a widget into a method:

- For Windows/Linux: `Ctrl` + `Alt` + `M`
- For MacOS: `Cmd` + `Option` + `M`

Here's how to do it:

1. Select the widget you want to extract. For example, if you want to extract the first `Container` widget, you would select everything from `Container(` to its closing parenthesis `),`.

2. Press the shortcut (`Ctrl` + `Alt` + `M` or `Cmd` + `Option` + `M`). A dialog will appear.

3. In the dialog, enter the name of the new method and press `Enter`.

The selected widget will be replaced with a call to the new method, and the method will be created with the extracted widget.
