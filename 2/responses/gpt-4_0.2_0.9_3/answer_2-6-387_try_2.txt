The error message indicates that the SQLite database does not have a table named "Keys". This table is used by IdentityServer4 to store the keys for token signing.

In ASP.NET Core 6.0, IdentityServer4 is replaced by the Duende IdentityServer. If you have upgraded from ASP.NET Core 5.0 to 6.0, you need to migrate from IdentityServer4 to Duende IdentityServer.

Here are the steps to migrate from IdentityServer4 to Duende IdentityServer:

1. Replace the IdentityServer4 NuGet package with the Duende IdentityServer package.

2. Update the namespaces in your code from `IdentityServer4` to `Duende.IdentityServer`.

3. Update the database schema. Duende IdentityServer has a different database schema than IdentityServer4. You need to create a new migration and update the database. Here is how you can do it:

   - Add a new migration:
     ```
     Add-Migration InitialDuende -Context ApplicationDbContext -OutputDir Data/Migrations
     ```
   - Update the database:
     ```
     Update-Database -Context ApplicationDbContext
     ```

4. Update the configuration data. Duende IdentityServer has a different configuration data format than IdentityServer4. You need to update the configuration data according to the new format.

5. Update the startup configuration. Replace the `AddIdentityServer` method with the `AddIdentityServerV2` method.

Please note that Duende IdentityServer is not a free product. It is free for development and testing, but you need to purchase a license for production use.

If you want to stick with IdentityServer4, you need to downgrade your project to ASP.NET Core 5.0, because IdentityServer4 is not compatible with ASP.NET Core 6.0.
