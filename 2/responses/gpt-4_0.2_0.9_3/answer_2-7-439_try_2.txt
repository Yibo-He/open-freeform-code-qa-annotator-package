The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. This means you cannot install it using Composer. Instead, you need to install it on your system where PHP is installed.

Here's how you can install it:

1. For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```
2. For CentOS:
```bash
sudo yum install php-pecl-zip
```
3. For Windows:
   - Locate your `php.ini` file (you can check where it is from `phpinfo();`)
   - Uncomment the line `;extension=php_zip.dll` by removing the semicolon at the start
   - Restart your Apache server

After installing the extension, you can verify it's installed by running `php -m` in your terminal, it should list `zip` in the output.

If you're using Docker, you need to add the extension installation command in your Dockerfile.

After you've installed the `ext-zip` extension, you can then add it to your `composer.json` file like so:

```json
"require": {
    "php": "^7.1.3",
    "ext-zip": "*",
    // ... other dependencies
}
```

Then run `composer install` again.
