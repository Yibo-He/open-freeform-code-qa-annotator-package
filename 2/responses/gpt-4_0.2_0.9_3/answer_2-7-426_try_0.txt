The "CSRF token mismatch" error is often caused by issues related to sessions. Since you've already checked the session files and found that multiple sessions are being generated for one user, it's likely that the issue is related to how sessions are being handled on your server.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Domain Configuration**: Make sure that your domain is correctly configured in your `.env` file. The `APP_URL` should match the domain you're using. If it doesn't, Laravel might not be able to correctly link the session to the user.

2. **Cookie Domain**: If your application is served from a subdomain, you might need to specify the parent domain in the `SESSION_DOMAIN` variable in your `.env` file. For example, if your application is served from `app.example.com`, you should set `SESSION_DOMAIN=.example.com`.

3. **Session Cookie Path**: Check the `SESSION_COOKIE_PATH` in your `.env` file. It should be set to `/` to make the session cookie available to all routes in your application.

4. **HTTPS**: If your application is served over HTTPS, make sure that the `SESSION_SECURE_COOKIE` is set to `true` in your `.env` file. This ensures that the session cookie is only sent over secure connections.

5. **Server Configuration**: Some server configurations might interfere with how sessions are handled. For example, if you're using a load balancer without sticky sessions, requests from the same user might be sent to different servers, causing multiple sessions to be created. Check your server configuration to make sure it's compatible with Laravel's session handling.

6. **Cache Configuration**: If you're using a cache driver like Redis or Memcached for sessions, make sure it's correctly configured and working as expected. You might need to clear the cache to resolve the issue.

7. **Session Driver**: Try changing the session driver to `database` or `cookie` to see if the issue persists. This can help you determine if the issue is related to the session driver you're currently using.

Remember to clear your config cache (`php artisan config:cache`) after making changes to your `.env` file.
