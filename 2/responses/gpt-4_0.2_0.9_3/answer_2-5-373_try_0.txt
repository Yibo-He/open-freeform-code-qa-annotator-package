It seems like you didn't provide the exact error message you're encountering. However, I can give you some general advice on how to handle such situations.

1. Check if the database is in use: If any user is connected to the database, you won't be able to delete it. Make sure to disconnect all users from the database you want to delete.

2. Check your permissions: Make sure that your user account has the necessary permissions to create and delete databases.

3. Use the DROP DATABASE command: If you're unable to delete the database through the pgAdmin interface, you can try using the DROP DATABASE command in the SQL query tool.

Here is an example of how to use this command:

```
DROP DATABASE "eCommerce";
```

Remember to replace "eCommerce" with the name of your database.

4. If you're trying to create a new database with the same name as an existing one, you'll need to delete the existing database first or choose a different name for your new database.

If none of these solutions work, please provide the exact error message you're encountering for more specific help.
