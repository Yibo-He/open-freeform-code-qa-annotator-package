Including the banner image in your Docker image during the build process is a good practice if the image is not expected to change frequently. This is because every time the image changes, you would need to rebuild and redeploy the Docker image. 

In your case, if the banner image is static and does not change often, it makes sense to include it in the Docker image. This way, the image contains everything it needs to run the microservice, making it portable and self-contained. 

Your Dockerfile already includes the necessary command to copy the Assets directory (which contains the banner image) into the Docker image:

```COPY src/Email.Service/Assets Assets```

This command copies the Assets directory from your local machine into the Docker image. 

If the banner image changes frequently, another approach would be to store the image in a cloud storage service (like AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, etc.) and have your microservice download it when needed. This way, you wouldn't need to rebuild and redeploy the Docker image every time the image changes. However, this approach introduces additional complexity and potential points of failure into your system (e.g., the microservice needs to be able to handle the case where it can't download the image). 

In conclusion, whether to include the image in the Docker image or not depends on how often the image changes and the trade-offs you're willing to make between simplicity and flexibility.
