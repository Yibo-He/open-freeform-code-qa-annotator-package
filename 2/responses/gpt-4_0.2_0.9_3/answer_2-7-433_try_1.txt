The error message you're seeing is due to the `allow_url_fopen` setting in your PHP configuration being disabled. This setting is required by Composer to download packages from the internet. 

Here's how you can enable it:

1. Find your `php.ini` file. The location of this file varies depending on your server setup. You can find it by running `php --ini` in your terminal.

2. Open the `php.ini` file in a text editor.

3. Find the line that says `allow_url_fopen = Off` and change it to `allow_url_fopen = On`. If the line doesn't exist, you can add it to the file.

4. Save the changes and close the file.

5. Restart your web server. The command to do this varies depending on your server setup. For Apache, you can usually use `sudo service apache2 restart`.

6. Try running `composer update` again.

If you don't have access to the `php.ini` file or can't restart the server, you may need to contact your hosting provider or server administrator for assistance. 

Also, make sure that the PHP curl extension is installed and enabled, as the warning message suggests. You can do this by adding `extension=curl` to your `php.ini` file and restarting the server. If the extension isn't installed, you may need to install it using your server's package manager or by compiling PHP with the `--with-curl` option.
