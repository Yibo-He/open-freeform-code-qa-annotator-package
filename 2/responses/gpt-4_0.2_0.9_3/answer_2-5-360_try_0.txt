The issue is with the property name you are trying to inject. In your `data.yml` file, the property name is `main.header.info` but in your Java code, you are trying to inject `main.header1.info`. 

The correct way to inject the property is:

```java
@Component
@PropertySource("classpath:data.yml")
public class SomeClass {
    @Value("${main.header.info}")
    private long info;
    ...
}
```

Also, make sure you have the `snakeyaml` dependency in your project because Spring uses it to load `.yml` or `.yaml` files. If you are using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.yaml</groupId>
    <artifactId>snakeyaml</artifactId>
    <version>1.27</version>
</dependency>
```

If you are using Gradle, add the following to your `build.gradle`:

```gradle
implementation 'org.yaml:snakeyaml:1.27'
```
