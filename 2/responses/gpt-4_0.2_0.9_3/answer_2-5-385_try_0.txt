The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the Android Gradle Plugin version 7.1.2. This might be due to a couple of reasons:

1. The version of Android Gradle Plugin you're trying to use is not yet available or doesn't exist. As of the time of writing this, the latest stable version of the Android Gradle Plugin is 7.0.2.

2. Your Android Studio is not able to connect to the internet to download the plugin.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your Android Gradle Plugin version**: Make sure you're using a correct and available version of the Android Gradle Plugin. You can check the latest version from the [official Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin). If you're not using the correct version, you can change it in your project level `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.2'
}
```

2. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure your Android Studio is able to connect to the internet to download the necessary plugins and dependencies.

3. **Check your Gradle version**: The Android Gradle Plugin version you're using might require a specific Gradle version. You can check the compatibility from the [official Android Developer website](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle). If you're not using the correct Gradle version, you can change it in your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

4. **Invalidate Caches and Restart**: Sometimes, Android Studio might have cached some incorrect data. You can try invalidating these caches and restarting Android Studio by going to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

5. **Check your Proxy Settings**: If you're behind a proxy, you might need to configure your proxy settings in Android Studio. You can do this by going to `File > Settings > Appearance & Behavior > System Settings > HTTP Proxy`.

After making these changes, try to sync your Gradle files again.
