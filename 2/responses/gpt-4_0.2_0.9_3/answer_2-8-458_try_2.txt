The error message you're seeing is because Go is trying to find your package in the GOROOT directory, but it should be looking in the GOPATH directory. 

Since Go 1.11, the Go team introduced a new concept called 'Go Modules' which is a dependency management system that makes dependency version information explicit and easier to manage. This is likely the cause of the issue you're experiencing.

Here are some steps to resolve your issue:

1. Make sure you're using Go 1.11 or later. You can check your Go version by running `go version` in your terminal.

2. Enable Go Modules. You can do this by setting the environment variable `GO111MODULE` to `on`. In your terminal, you can do this by running `set GO111MODULE=on` on Windows or `export GO111MODULE=on` on Unix systems.

3. Initialize a new module or migrate existing code to use modules. In your case, since you already ran `go mod init` in your modules, you can skip this step.

4. Now, you should be able to build your project. Try running `go build` in your project directory.

5. If you're still having issues, try clearing your Go build cache by running `go clean -modcache`.

6. Finally, make sure your IDE (Goland) is configured to use Go Modules. You can do this by going to `File > Settings > Go > Go Modules (vgo)` and ensure that the `Enable Go Modules (vgo) integration` checkbox is checked.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
