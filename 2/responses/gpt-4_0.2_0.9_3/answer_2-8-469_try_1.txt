The error message is indicating that `protoc-gen-go` is unable to determine the Go import path for your `simple.proto` file. This is because the `go_package` option is not specified in your `.proto` file and you didn't provide a "M" argument on the command line.

You can resolve this issue by adding a `go_package` option to your `simple.proto` file. The `go_package` option should be a full import path, which includes the full path of the package where the generated Go code will be placed.

Here's how you can modify your `simple.proto` file:

```protobuf
syntax="proto3";

package main;

option go_package = "github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/yourpackage";

message Person {
      string name = 1;
      int32 age = 2; 
}
```

Replace `"github.com/yourusername/yourrepository/yourpackage"` with the actual path to your Go package.

After adding the `go_package` option, you can generate the Go code with the same `protoc` command:

```bash
protoc --go_out=. simple.proto
```

This should generate the Go code without any errors.
