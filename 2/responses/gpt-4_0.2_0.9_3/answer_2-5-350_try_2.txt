The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to access a file because it's being used by another process or it doesn't have the necessary permissions. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Close any running instances of your IDE or Gradle:** If you have any running instances of your IDE or Gradle, close them. This will ensure that no other process is using the file that Gradle is trying to access.

2. **Delete the .gradle directory:** The error message indicates that the file Gradle is trying to access is located in the .gradle directory. You can try deleting this directory and then re-running your application. Gradle should automatically re-download any necessary files. The .gradle directory is typically located in your user home directory.

3. **Check your file permissions:** Make sure that your user account has the necessary permissions to read and write to the .gradle directory and its contents. If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can use the `chmod` command to change the file permissions.

4. **Update Gradle:** If none of the above steps work, you might be dealing with a bug in Gradle. Try updating to the latest version of Gradle and see if that resolves the issue.

5. **Check your antivirus software:** Sometimes, antivirus software can interfere with file access. Try temporarily disabling your antivirus software and see if that resolves the issue.

Remember to always backup your projects and important files before making any major changes to your system.
