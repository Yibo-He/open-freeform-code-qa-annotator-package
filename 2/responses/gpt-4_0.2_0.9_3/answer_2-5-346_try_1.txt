The error you're seeing is likely because Gradle is not using the correct Java version. Even though you've set the Java version in IntelliJ, Gradle might still be using a different version. 

You can specify the Java version for Gradle in a couple of ways:

1. **gradle.properties file**: You can specify the Java version in a `gradle.properties` file in your project directory. If the file doesn't exist, you can create it. Add the following lines to the file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

2. **GRADLE_OPTS environment variable**: You can set the `GRADLE_OPTS` environment variable to specify the Java version. Add the following line to your shell profile file (like `.bashrc`, `.bash_profile`, or `.zshrc`):

```bash
export GRADLE_OPTS="-Dorg.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk17"
```

Again, replace `/path/to/your/jdk17` with the actual path to your JDK 17 installation.

After setting the Java version for Gradle, try running your app again. It should now use the correct Java version.
