The error is because you are trying to create an index on a navigation property. EF Core does not support this. You should create an index on the foreign key property instead. 

Here's how you can modify your `OnModelCreating` method:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not Gender
    });
}
```

In this code, the `HasIndex` method is used to configure an index on the `GenderId` property of the `User` entity. This is the correct way to create an index on a foreign key property.
