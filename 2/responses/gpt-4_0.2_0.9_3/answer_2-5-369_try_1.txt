In IntelliJ IDEA, local changes are now shown in a dedicated tab in the Git tool window. You can find it at the bottom of the IDE. 

Here are the steps to view your local changes:

1. Click on the "Version Control" tab (or press `Alt + 9` on Windows/Linux, `Command + 9` on macOS).
2. In the tool window that opens, click on the "Git" tab.
3. You should see a "Local Changes" tab in the Git tool window.

If you can't see the "Local Changes" tab, it might be because the new UI for the Git tool window is disabled. You can enable it by following these steps:

1. Go to "File" -> "Settings" (or press `Ctrl + Alt + S` on Windows/Linux, `Command + ,` on macOS).
2. In the "Settings" window, navigate to "Version Control" -> "Git".
3. Check the box that says "Use non-modal commit interface".
4. Click "Apply" and then "OK".

After doing this, you should be able to see your local changes in the Git tool window.
