The error message is indicating that `expressJwt` is not a function. This is likely because of how you're importing the `express-jwt` module. 

In your code, you're destructuring `expressJwt` from `require('express-jwt')`, which implies that `express-jwt` exports an object with a property `expressJwt` that is a function. However, `express-jwt` exports a function directly, not an object with a property that is a function.

So, you should change your import to this:

```javascript
const expressJwt = require('express-jwt');
```

This way, `expressJwt` will correctly be a function that you can call.
