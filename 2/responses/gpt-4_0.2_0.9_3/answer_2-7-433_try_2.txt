The error message is indicating that the PHP setting `allow_url_fopen` is disabled in your server's `php.ini` configuration file. This setting is required by Composer to download packages from the internet.

Here are the steps to enable `allow_url_fopen`:

1. Login to your cPanel.
2. Navigate to the "Select PHP Version" section.
3. Click on the "Switch To PHP Options" link.
4. Find the `allow_url_fopen` option and change it to "On".
5. Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

If you don't have access to change PHP settings via cPanel, you will need to contact your hosting provider and ask them to enable the `allow_url_fopen` setting for you.

After enabling `allow_url_fopen`, try running `composer update` again. If you still encounter issues, make sure that the PHP `curl` extension is installed and enabled, as the warning message suggests. This can also be done in the "Select PHP Version" section of cPanel.

If you're still having trouble after these steps, please provide more details about your server environment and the exact error messages you're seeing.
