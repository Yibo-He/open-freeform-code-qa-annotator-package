The error you're seeing is because PHP is unable to find the `vendor/autoload.php` file in your project directory. The `vendor/autoload.php` file is generated by Composer when you install dependencies for your project.

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. Open your command line and navigate to your project directory (`C:\xampp\htdocs\site_web`).

2. Run the command `composer install` or `composer update`. This will install or update all the dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file and generate the `vendor/autoload.php` file.

3. If you don't have a `composer.json` file in your project directory, you need to create one. You can do this by running `composer init` and following the prompts. After creating the `composer.json` file, you can add PHPMailer as a dependency by running `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`.

4. After running these commands, check your project directory for the `vendor` folder. Inside this folder, you should see the `autoload.php` file.

5. Now, in your `send_mail.php` file, you can require the `vendor/autoload.php` file like this:

```php
require __DIR__ . '/vendor/autoload.php';
```

This line of code will include the `vendor/autoload.php` file from the same directory where your `send_mail.php` file is located.

Remember, the `vendor/autoload.php` file should not be moved or edited manually. It is automatically generated and managed by Composer. If you move or edit this file manually, you might break the autoloading of your dependencies.
