The issue you're facing is because the properties in your `City` class are defined as fields, not properties. The JSON serializer in ASP.NET Core will not serialize fields, it only serializes properties.

You can resolve this issue by changing the fields in your `City` class to properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In C#, properties are defined with `{ get; set; }` syntax. This allows you to get or set the value of the property. 

After making these changes, your API should return the expected JSON response.
