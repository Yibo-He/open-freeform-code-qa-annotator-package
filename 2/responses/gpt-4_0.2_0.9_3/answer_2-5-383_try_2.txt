The error message you're seeing is indicating that the application is unable to create the `entityManagerFactory` bean because it requires a `dataSource` or `dataSourceClassName` or `jdbcUrl`. 

This is likely because you've deleted the `dataSource()` method from `DatabaseConfig.java`. This method is responsible for creating a `DataSource` bean that Spring Boot uses to configure the database connection.

You should add the `dataSource()` method back to `DatabaseConfig.java`:

```java
@Configuration
public class DatabaseConfig {
    @Bean
    @Primary
    @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "spring.datasource")
    public DataSource dataSource() { 
        return DataSourceBuilder.create().build(); 
    }

    @Bean
    public SimpleMailMessage templateSimpleMessage() {
        SimpleMailMessage message = new SimpleMailMessage();
        message.setText(
                "This is the test email template for your email:\n%s\n");
        return message;
    }
}
```

Also, make sure that the `spring.datasource` properties in your `application.yml` are correctly configured. The `url`, `username`, and `password` should match your PostgreSQL database settings.

If you still encounter the issue after adding back the `dataSource()` method, please provide more details about the changes you made during the update.
