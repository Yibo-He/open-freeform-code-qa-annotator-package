This error is related to the way Windows handles command line arguments with embedded quotes. It's a known issue with NetBeans and Maven on Windows.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Downgrade to NetBeans 8.2**: This version doesn't have the issue with embedded quotes.

2. **Use a different command line interpreter**: Instead of `cmd`, you could use PowerShell, Git Bash, or Cygwin. You can change the command line interpreter in the NetBeans settings.

3. **Move your installation to a path without spaces**: The issue is caused by the space in the path to `mvn.cmd`. If you move your NetBeans and Maven installations to a path without spaces, the issue should be resolved.

4. **Upgrade to a newer version of NetBeans**: This issue has been fixed in newer versions of NetBeans. If you upgrade to the latest version, the issue should be resolved.

5. **Edit the NetBeans configuration file**: You can edit the `netbeans.conf` file to change the way NetBeans handles command line arguments. You can find more information on how to do this in the NetBeans documentation.

Remember to always backup your work before making any major changes to your system or software.
