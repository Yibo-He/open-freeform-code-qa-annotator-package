The error you're encountering is because the `Input` facade was removed in Laravel 6.0. You should replace any usage of the `Input` facade with a `Request` facade.

So, instead of using `Input::get('key')`, you should use `Request::input('key')`.

If you want to use the `Request` facade, make sure to include it at the top of your file:

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request;
```

Then you can use it in your code like this:

```php
$value = Request::input('key');
```

Or if you want to use dependency injection, you can do it like this:

```php
public function yourFunctionName(Illuminate\Http\Request $request)
{
    $value = $request->input('key');
}
```

Remember to replace `'key'` with the actual key you're trying to access.
