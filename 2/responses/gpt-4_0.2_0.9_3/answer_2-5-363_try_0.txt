The `@RequiredArgsConstructor` annotation in Lombok is used to generate a constructor with parameters for all final fields, as well as any fields marked as `@NonNull`. This is useful to ensure that these fields are always initialized when an instance of the class is created.

The `@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor = @__(@Inject))` is a bit more specific. It does the same thing as `@RequiredArgsConstructor`, but it also adds the `@Inject` annotation to the generated constructor. 

The `@Inject` annotation is part of the Java CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) standard. It's used to mark a constructor, field, or method as to be dependency injected. In other words, it's a way of telling the system, "Hey, I need an instance of this class. Please create one for me and set it here."

So, the difference between the two is that the latter one is used when you want the generated constructor to be used for dependency injection.
