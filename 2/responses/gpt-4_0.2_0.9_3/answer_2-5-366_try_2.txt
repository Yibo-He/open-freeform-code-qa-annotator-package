The error message you're seeing is often caused by a version mismatch between Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. 

In your case, you're using Spring Boot 2.4.0 and Spring Cloud Hoxton.SR8. According to the Spring Cloud [version matrix](https://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud#overview), Spring Boot 2.4.x is compatible with Spring Cloud 2020.0.x (also known as Ilford) and not with Hoxton.

To fix this issue, you should update your Spring Cloud version to a release that's compatible with Spring Boot 2.4.0. Here's how you can do that:

1. Replace `<spring-cloud.version>Hoxton.SR8</spring-cloud.version>` with `<spring-cloud.version>2020.0.3</spring-cloud.version>` in the properties section of your pom.xml.

2. Replace the spring-cloud-dependencies artifact version in your dependencyManagement section with `${spring-cloud.version}`.

Here's how your updated pom.xml should look:

```xml
<properties>
    <java.version>15</java.version>
    <maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target>
    <maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source>
    <spring-cloud.version>2020.0.3</spring-cloud.version>
</properties>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
            <artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
            <version>${spring-cloud.version}</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

After making these changes, try running your application again. If you're still encountering issues, there may be other version incompatibilities in your project that need to be resolved.
