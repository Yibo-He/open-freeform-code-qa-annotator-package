1. You are not overlooking anything obvious. The issue you are facing is due to the fact that Go's type system does not provide a way to create an instance of a generic type parameter. This is a limitation of the current design of generics in Go.

2. Yes, this is a limitation of generics in Go. The workaround you found, using a constructor function, is currently the best way to handle this situation. It is not ideal, but it is the only way to create an instance of a generic type parameter in Go.

3. This limitation is known and is a result of the design decisions made in the creation of generics for Go. It is unlikely that raising an issue would result in any changes, as this is not a bug but a design decision. However, you could still raise an issue to discuss this limitation and see if there are any plans to address it in the future.

In conclusion, the current design of generics in Go does not provide a way to create an instance of a generic type parameter. This is a known limitation and the workaround you found, using a constructor function, is currently the best way to handle this situation.
