In Android Studio or IntelliJ, you can use the Refactor feature to extract a widget into a method. Here are the steps:

1. Select the widget you want to extract. In your case, select the widget starting from `Container(` to the corresponding closing parenthesis `),`.

2. Press `Ctrl + Alt + M` on Windows/Linux or `Cmd + Option + M` on Mac. This is the shortcut for the "Extract Method" refactoring.

3. A dialog will appear asking you to name the new method. Enter the name and press `Enter`.

This will create a new method with the selected widget and replace the original widget with a call to the new method. This can help simplify complex layouts by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable methods.
