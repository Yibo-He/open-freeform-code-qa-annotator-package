Yes, starting from API 30, the `setView` method in `Toast` class has been deprecated. This is because custom toast views are no longer supported in Android 11 (API level 30). 

However, you can create custom toasts using `Snackbar` from the Material Design library, or you can create a custom layout and display it as a dialog or a new activity with a transparent background.

Here's an example of how to use `Snackbar`:

```java
Snackbar snackbar = Snackbar.make(findViewById(android.R.id.content), "", Snackbar.LENGTH_LONG);
Snackbar.SnackbarLayout layout = (Snackbar.SnackbarLayout) snackbar.getView();
TextView textView = (TextView) layout.findViewById(com.google.android.material.R.id.snackbar_text);
textView.setVisibility(View.INVISIBLE);

View snackView = getLayoutInflater().inflate(R.layout.my_snackbar, null);
layout.setPadding(0, 0, 0, 0);
layout.addView(snackView, 0);

snackbar.show();
```

In the above code, `my_snackbar` is the custom layout you want to show.

If you want to stick with `Toast`, you can create a custom layout and display it as a dialog or a new activity with a transparent background. But remember, this is not a toast and it won't behave like a toast. It's just a workaround.
