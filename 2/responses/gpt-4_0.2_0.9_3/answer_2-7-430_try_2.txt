The issue seems to be with the configuration of your routes. In EasyAdmin 3, the configuration has been changed and it's different from EasyAdmin 2. 

In EasyAdmin 3, you don't need to define the route in `config/routes/easy_admin.yaml` file. Instead, you should create a DashboardController and configure your admin backend there.

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```php
// src/Controller/Admin/DashboardController.php
namespace App\Controller\Admin;

use EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\Config\Dashboard;
use EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\Config\MenuItem;
use EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\Controller\AbstractDashboardController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class DashboardController extends AbstractDashboardController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/admin", name="admin")
     */
    public function index(): Response
    {
        return parent::index();
    }

    public function configureDashboard(): Dashboard
    {
        return Dashboard::new()
            ->setTitle('Your Project Name');
    }

    public function configureMenuItems(): iterable
    {
        yield MenuItem::linktoDashboard('Dashboard', 'fa fa-home');
        // add other menu items here
    }
}
```

After creating this controller, you should be able to access your admin dashboard at `/admin` route.

Remember to clear the cache after these changes:

```bash
symfony console cache:clear
```

Also, make sure you have installed EasyAdmin 3, not EasyAdmin 2. You can check this in your `composer.json` file. If you see `"easycorp/easyadmin-bundle": "^2.3"` then you have EasyAdmin 2 installed. If you see `"easycorp/easyadmin-bundle": "^3.0"` then you have EasyAdmin 3 installed. If you have EasyAdmin 2, you should upgrade to EasyAdmin 3 or adjust your configuration according to EasyAdmin 2 documentation.
