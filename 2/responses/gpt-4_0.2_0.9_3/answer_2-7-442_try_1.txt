The error message you're seeing is because PHP can't find the `vendor/autoload.php` file. This file is generated by Composer when you install dependencies for your project. 

Here's how you can solve this issue:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to your project directory (`C:\xampp\htdocs\site_web`).

2. Run `composer install` or `composer update`. This will install or update the dependencies defined in your `composer.json` file and generate the `vendor` directory and the `autoload.php` file.

3. Make sure your `require 'vendor/autoload.php';` line is correct. It should be relative to the file where this line is written. If the script with this line is in the root of your project, then it should work fine.

If you've already run `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer` in your project directory, the `vendor/autoload.php` file should be in your project directory (`C:\xampp\htdocs\site_web`), not in `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\vendor\`.

The `vendor/autoload.php` in `C:\Windows\SysWOW64\vendor\` is likely for a different project or a global Composer installation, and should not be used for your project.
