It seems like you're dealing with a session management issue. Here's a general step-by-step process to handle this:

1. **Run the Command**: You didn't specify the command you're running, but I assume it's related to logging out a user. This could be a command to delete a session, or a command to log out a user in a web application.

2. **Check Session Validity**: Before executing the logout command, check if the session is still valid. This can be done by checking the session's expiry time against the current time.

3. **Execute Logout**: If the session is valid, execute the logout command. This could involve deleting the session data, or sending a command to the server to log out the user.

4. **Handle Expired Sessions**: If the session is already expired, you should handle this gracefully. Instead of showing an error message, you can simply redirect the user to the login page, or show a message saying "Session expired, please login again". This can be done in the error handling part of your code.

5. **Test**: Finally, test your code to make sure it works as expected. Try logging out with both valid and expired sessions, and make sure the correct behavior happens in each case.

Remember, the exact steps and code will depend on the programming language and framework you're using. If you provide more specific details, I can give a more tailored answer.
