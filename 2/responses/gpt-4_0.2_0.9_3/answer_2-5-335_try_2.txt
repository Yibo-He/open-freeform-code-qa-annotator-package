In Flutter, the `print()` function should work for logging data to the console. If you're not seeing any output, it could be due to a few reasons:

1. The program isn't reaching the point where `print()` is called. Make sure the `print()` statement is in a part of your code that is actually being executed.

2. There's an error occurring before the `print()` statement is reached. Check your console for any error messages.

3. IntelliJ IDEA's console might be filtering out your logs. Check the settings of your console to make sure it's showing all logs.

Here's an example of how you can use `print()` in Flutter:

```dart
void main() {
  print('Hello, World!');
}
```

When you run this program, "Hello, World!" should be printed to the console.

If you're trying to debug your Flutter application, you might find the `debugPrint()` function useful. It behaves similarly to `print()`, but it throttles the output to a level that avoids being dropped by the system:

```dart
void main() {
  debugPrint('Hello, Debug World!');
}
```

Remember to import the foundation library to use `debugPrint()`:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';
```
