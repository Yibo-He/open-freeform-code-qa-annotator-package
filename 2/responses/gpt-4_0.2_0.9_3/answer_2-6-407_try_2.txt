The error message you're seeing is typically due to the server returning HTML when JSON is expected. This often happens when there's an error on the server and it returns an HTML error page instead of the expected JSON response.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Check the URL of your API call. The error message indicates that the server is returning HTML, which often happens when the requested URL does not exist. Make sure the URL in your Blazor app matches the URL of your API.

2. Check the server logs. If there's an error on the server, it should be logged there. This can give you more information about what's going wrong.

3. Test your API independently of your Blazor app. You can use tools like Postman or curl to send requests to your API and see what it returns. This can help you verify that your API is working correctly and returning the expected JSON.

4. Check your routing configuration in your API. The route you've defined in your API controller is `[Route("api/Employee/Index")]`, but in your Blazor app you're trying to access `/api/Employee/Index`. Make sure the route in your Blazor app matches the route in your API controller.

5. Make sure your API is correctly returning JSON. You can add `[Produces("application/json")]` attribute to your API action to ensure it's returning JSON.

6. If you're running your Blazor app and API on different ports or domains, you may be running into CORS issues. You'll need to configure your API to allow requests from your Blazor app's origin.

7. Finally, you might want to consider using the newer `HttpClient.GetFromJsonAsync` method instead of `HttpClient.GetJsonAsync`. The newer method is available in .NET Core 3.1 and later and provides better error handling.
