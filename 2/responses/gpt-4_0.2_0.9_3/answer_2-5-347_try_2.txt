The error message suggests that there are some conflicts in the installation area which are preventing the update to IntelliJ IDEA 2020.3. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as file permissions, corrupted files, or other software conflicts.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Backup your settings**: Before you start, it's a good idea to backup your settings. You can do this by going to `File > Manage IDE Settings > Export Settings`.

2. **Uninstall the current version**: Uninstall the current version of IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by deleting the IntelliJ IDEA directory. This is usually located in the `/opt` directory or in your home directory under `~/snap` if you installed it via snap. 

3. **Download the new version**: Download the new version of IntelliJ IDEA from the official JetBrains website.

4. **Install the new version**: Install the new version by following the instructions provided by JetBrains. If you downloaded the `.tar.gz` file, you can extract it to your preferred location (usually `/opt`) and run the `idea.sh` file in the `bin` directory.

5. **Restore your settings**: You can restore your settings by going to `File > Manage IDE Settings > Import Settings`.

If you're still having trouble, it might be a good idea to reach out to JetBrains support for further assistance.
