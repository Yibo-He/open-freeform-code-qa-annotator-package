It seems like you're doing everything correctly according to the Xdebug installation guide. However, the error message you're seeing suggests that PHP is not able to load the Xdebug extension. Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check the path of the Xdebug extension**: Make sure the path `/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20190902/xdebug.so` is correct. You can do this by running `ls /opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20190902/xdebug.so` in the terminal. If the file does not exist, you'll need to find the correct path where the Xdebug extension is installed.

2. **Check the PHP version**: The path `/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20190902/xdebug.so` suggests that you're using PHP 7.4 (20190902 is the API version for PHP 7.4). Make sure you're indeed using PHP 7.4 by running `php -v` in the terminal. If you're using a different version of PHP, you'll need to install the Xdebug extension for that version and adjust the path in the `php.ini` file accordingly.

3. **Check the architecture of the Xdebug extension**: Since you're using a Mac with an M1 chip, you're running on an arm64 architecture. However, you're installing the Xdebug extension for the x86_64 architecture (`arch -x86_64 sudo pecl install xdebug`). This could be the cause of the problem. Try installing the Xdebug extension without specifying the architecture (`sudo pecl install xdebug`) and see if that solves the problem.

4. **Check the `php.ini` file**: Make sure you're editing the correct `php.ini` file. You can find the location of the `php.ini` file used by PHP by running `php --ini` in the terminal. Also, after editing the `php.ini` file, make sure to restart the web server for the changes to take effect.

If none of these suggestions solve the problem, please provide more details about your setup (e.g., the output of `php -v` and `php --ini`, the exact error message you're seeing, etc.) so I can give more specific advice.
