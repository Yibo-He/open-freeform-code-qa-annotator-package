The `err113` linter is suggesting that you should use static errors instead of dynamic ones. This is because dynamic errors (like the ones you're creating with `errors.New()`) are not comparable, and this can make error handling more difficult.

To fix this, you should define your errors as package-level variables, and then use those in your code. Here's an example:

```go
var (
    ErrRepoGave = errors.New("repo gave err")
    ErrOops = errors.New("oops")
)

func TestFoo(t *testing.T) {
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().Save(gomock.Eq(&foooBarBar)).Return(nil, ErrRepoGave)
    // ...
    repoMock.EXPECT().FindAll().Return(nil, ErrOops)
    // ...
}
```

This way, the errors are static and can be compared. For example, you can do something like this in your code:

```go
if err == ErrRepoGave {
    // handle this specific error
}
```

If you need to add more context to your errors, you can use `fmt.Errorf()` to wrap your static errors:

```go
return fmt.Errorf("while saving foo: %w", ErrRepoGave)
```

This will still allow you to compare errors using `errors.Is()`, like so:

```go
if errors.Is(err, ErrRepoGave) {
    // handle this specific error
}
```

This is considered more idiomatic in Go, and it's what the `err113` linter is suggesting.
