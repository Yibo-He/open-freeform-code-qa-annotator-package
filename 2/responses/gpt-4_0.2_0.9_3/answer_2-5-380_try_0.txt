The issue you're facing might be due to the change in the default URL for Swagger UI when using the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library. 

In the older Swagger 2.x library, the default URL was `/swagger-ui.html`. However, in the Springdoc OpenAPI UI library, the default URL is `/swagger-ui/index.html`.

So, try accessing your Swagger UI at `localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html` or `localhost:8080/swagger-ui/`.

If you want to customize the Swagger UI path, you can do so by adding the following property to your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
springdoc.swagger-ui.path=/swagger-ui.html
```

This will change the Swagger UI path back to `/swagger-ui.html`.

Also, make sure that your application is running and that the server port is indeed 8080. If your server is running on a different port, you'll need to adjust the URL accordingly.
