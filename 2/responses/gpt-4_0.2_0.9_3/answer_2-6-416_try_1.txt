The error message you're seeing is because Entity Framework 6.4.4 is not compatible with .NET 6.0. 

Entity Framework 6.4.4 is the last version of Entity Framework 6, which is a different line of Entity Framework that is not compatible with .NET Core or .NET 5+. It's only compatible with .NET Framework, which is a different technology that is not being developed anymore.

If you're using .NET 6.0, you should be using Entity Framework Core instead of Entity Framework 6.4.4. The latest version at the time of writing is Entity Framework Core 6.0.

Here are the steps to add Entity Framework Core to your project:

1. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select Manage NuGet Packages.
2. In the NuGet Package Manager, switch to the Browse tab and search for Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.
3. Select the package and install it.

You may also need to install the package for your specific database provider. For example, if you're using SQL Server, you would also need to install the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer package.

After you've installed the necessary packages, you should be able to use Entity Framework Core in your project.
