The error you're encountering is not due to PHP 7.4. Laravel 6.x does support PHP 7.4. The error is due to Laravel Telescope. 

The error is coming from the QueryWatcher.php file in the Telescope package. This file is trying to access an array offset on a null value, which is not allowed in PHP 7.4 and thus throws an error. 

You can try to disable Telescope in your testing environment to see if that resolves the issue. You can do this by adding the following code to your `TelescopeServiceProvider.php`:

```php
public function register()
{
    $this->hideSensitiveRequestDetails();

    Telescope::filter(function (IncomingEntry $entry) {
        if ($this->app->isLocal()) {
            return true;
        }

        return $entry->isReportableException() ||
               $entry->isFailedJob() ||
               $entry->isScheduledTask() ||
               $entry->hasMonitoredTag();
    });

    // Add this code
    if ($this->app->environment('testing')) {
        Telescope::stopRecording();
    }
}
```

This code will stop Telescope from recording in your testing environment, which should prevent the error from occurring.

If you still want to use Telescope in your testing environment, you will need to wait for a fix from the Telescope package. You can also try to update your Telescope package to the latest version to see if the issue has been resolved.
