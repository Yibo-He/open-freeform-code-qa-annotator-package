It seems like you have done everything correctly. However, starting from EasyAdmin 3, the configuration has changed a bit. The `/admin` route is no longer automatically configured. You need to create a DashboardController and configure the route manually.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new DashboardController:

```bash
symfony console make:admin:dashboard
```

This will create a new `DashboardController.php` file in the `src/Controller/Admin` directory.

2. Open the `DashboardController.php` file and you should see something like this:

```php
namespace App\Controller\Admin;

use EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\Config\Dashboard;
use EasyCorp\Bundle\EasyAdminBundle\Controller\AbstractDashboardController;
use Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response;
use Symfony\Component\Routing\Annotation\Route;

class DashboardController extends AbstractDashboardController
{
    /**
     * @Route("/admin", name="admin")
     */
    public function index(): Response
    {
        return parent::index();
    }

    public function configureDashboard(): Dashboard
    {
        return Dashboard::new()
            // the name visible to end users
            ->setTitle('Your Project Name')
            // you can include HTML contents too (e.g. to link to an image)
            ->setTitle('<img src="..."> ACME <span class="text-small">Corp.</span>')
            // the path defined in this method is passed to the Twig asset() function
            ->setFaviconPath('favicon.svg')
            // the domain used by default is 'messages'
            ->setTranslationDomain('messages')
        ;
    }
}
```

3. Now, if you run `symfony console debug:router`, you should see the `/admin` route.

If you still don't see the `/admin` route, make sure that your routes are being imported correctly in the `config/routes.yaml` file. It should look something like this:

```yaml
easy_admin_bundle:
    resource: '../src/Controller/'
    type: annotation
```

This will import all routes from the controllers in the `src/Controller/` directory.
