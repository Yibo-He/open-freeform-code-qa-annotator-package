The error message you're seeing is because PHP can't find the file `vendor/autoload.php` in the current directory where your `send_mail.php` script is running.

The `vendor/autoload.php` file is generated by Composer. It's not something that would be installed globally on your system, but rather it's specific to each project you're working on.

When you run `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer`, Composer should create the `vendor` directory and the `autoload.php` file in the same directory where you ran the command.

Here are some steps to troubleshoot:

1. Make sure you're running the `composer require phpmailer/phpmailer` command in the root directory of your project (the same directory where your `send_mail.php` file is).

2. After running the `composer require` command, check if the `vendor` directory and the `autoload.php` file exist in your project directory. If they don't, there might be a problem with your Composer installation.

3. Make sure your `send_mail.php` script is in the correct directory and that the path to the `vendor/autoload.php` file is correct. The require statement is looking for the `vendor/autoload.php` file in the same directory where the script is running.

4. If you're still having trouble, you might want to try uninstalling and reinstalling Composer. There might be a problem with your Composer installation that's preventing it from creating the `vendor` directory and the `autoload.php` file.

Remember, the `vendor/autoload.php` file is not something that should be moved around or copied to different directories. It's generated by Composer and should stay in the directory where it was created.
