In .NET Core, you can use the `OkObjectResult` class to return a 200 OK status code along with your JSON data. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return new OkObjectResult(new { response = "Hello" });
}
```

In this case, you don't need to use `Json()` method because `OkObjectResult` automatically serializes your object to JSON.

If you want to return a different HTTP status code, you can use the `StatusCode` method, like this:

```csharp
public IActionResult GetResourceData()
{
    return StatusCode(201, new { response = "Created" });
}
```

This will return a 201 Created status code along with your JSON data.
