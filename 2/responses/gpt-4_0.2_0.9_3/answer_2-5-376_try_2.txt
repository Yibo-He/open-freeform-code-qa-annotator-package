The error message "invalid target release: 11" indicates that the Java compiler version that IntelliJ IDEA is using does not support Java 11. 

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File` > `Project Structure` > `Project Settings` > `Project`.
3. In the `Project SDK` section, select the correct JDK version (11 in your case). If it's not listed, click `New` > `JDK` and then navigate to the location where you installed JDK 11.
4. In the `Project language level` field, select `11 - Local variable syntax for lambda parameters`.
5. Click `OK` to save the changes.

If you still encounter the same issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Go to `File` > `Settings` > `Build, Execution, Deployment` > `Compiler` > `Java Compiler`.
2. In the `Target bytecode version` section, select `11` for all modules.
3. Click `OK` to save the changes.

Regarding your question about the JDK and JRE folders, starting from Java 9, Oracle provides JDK distributions without a separate JRE. This is because the JRE can be created from the JDK via the `jlink` tool. So, it's normal to see only the JDK folder for Java 11.

If you're still having trouble, please ensure that you've installed the correct version of JDK 11. You can download it from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). After downloading, install it and make sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the correct path.
