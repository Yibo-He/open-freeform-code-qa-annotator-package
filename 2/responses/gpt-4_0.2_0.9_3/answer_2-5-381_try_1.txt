The issue you're facing is likely due to the incorrect path in the import statement. The path should be relative to the source directory where you have your proto files.

In your case, the protobuf files are located in `src/main/proto/tech/tablesaw/service/common/`. So, you don't need to specify the full path in the import statement. 

Change your import statement in `column_metadata.proto` from:

```protobuf
import "tech/tablesaw/service/common/column_type.proto";
```

to:

```protobuf
import "column_type.proto";
```

This should resolve the issue. The protobuf compiler will now be able to find the `column_type.proto` file in the same directory as `column_metadata.proto`.
