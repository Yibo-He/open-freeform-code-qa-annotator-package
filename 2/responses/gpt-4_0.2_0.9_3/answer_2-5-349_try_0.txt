In your code, you are already using `@PathVariable` to get the `code` from the URL. You can send this `code` as a path variable in Postman.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open Postman.
2. Select POST from the dropdown.
3. Enter your URL in the URL bar. Replace `{code}` with the actual value you want to send. For example, if your server is running on `localhost:8080` and you want to send `123` as the `code`, your URL will be `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/123`.
4. Go to the `Body` tab.
5. Select `raw` and `JSON` from the dropdown.
6. Enter your `CustomerDTO` object in JSON format in the text area. For example, if your `CustomerDTO` has `name` and `email` fields, your JSON will look like this:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

7. Click `Send`.

Your server should now receive the `code` as a path variable and the `CustomerDTO` object as the request body.
