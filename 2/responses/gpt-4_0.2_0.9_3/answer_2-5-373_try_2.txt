It seems like you didn't provide the exact error messages you're encountering, which makes it difficult to provide a specific solution. However, here are some general steps you can take to troubleshoot issues when creating a database in pgAdmin 4:

1. **Check if the database already exists**: The error might be because a database with the same name already exists. In pgAdmin, you can see the list of databases in the Browser panel on the left. If a database named "eCommerce" already exists, you'll need to either delete it or create your new database with a different name.

2. **Check your permissions**: Make sure you have the necessary permissions to create a database. If you're not a superuser or don't have the CREATEDB privilege, you won't be able to create a new database.

3. **Check if there are active connections to the database**: If you're trying to delete a database but it's not working, it might be because there are active connections to the database. You can use the `pg_terminate_backend` function to terminate these connections.

4. **Check your syntax**: Make sure you're using the correct syntax to create a database. The basic syntax to create a database in PostgreSQL is `CREATE DATABASE dbname;`.

If none of these steps solve your problem, please provide the exact error messages you're getting so I can give a more specific solution.
