Yes, Go modules do support this kind of workflow. Here's how you can do it:

1. Copy your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files into the Docker image.

2. Run `go mod download`. This command will download all the dependencies specified in your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files. This will be cached as a separate Docker layer, as long as your `go.mod` and `go.sum` files don't change.

3. Copy the rest of your source code into the Docker image and run `go build`.

Here's a sample Dockerfile that demonstrates this:

```Dockerfile
# Start from the latest golang base image
FROM golang:latest

# Add Maintainer Info
LABEL maintainer="Your Name <your-email@example.com>"

# Set the Current Working Directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy go mod and sum files
COPY go.mod go.sum ./

# Download all dependencies. Dependencies will be cached if the go.mod and go.sum files are not changed
RUN go mod download

# Copy the source from the current directory to the Working Directory inside the container
COPY . .

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o main .

# Expose port 8080 to the outside world
EXPOSE 8080

# Command to run the executable
CMD ["./main"]
```

This Dockerfile will take advantage of Docker's layer caching. The `go mod download` step will be cached until your `go.mod` or `go.sum` files change. This will speed up your Docker builds if your dependencies don't change often.
