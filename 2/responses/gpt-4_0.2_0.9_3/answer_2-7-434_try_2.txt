The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is deprecated since Symfony 4.2. The new recommended way is to inject the Doctrine service into your controller method.

Here's an example:

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

public function yourMethod(EntityManagerInterface $em)
{
    $repository = $em->getRepository(YourEntity::class);
    // ...
}
```

In this example, `EntityManagerInterface` is the Doctrine service. The `$em` parameter is automatically injected with the Doctrine service (this is called autowiring).

This is part of Symfony's shift towards dependency injection, which makes your code more flexible and testable.
