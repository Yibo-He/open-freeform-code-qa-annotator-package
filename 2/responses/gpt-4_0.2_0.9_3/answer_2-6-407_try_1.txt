The error message you're seeing indicates that the response from your API call is not valid JSON. The '<' character is not a valid start of a JSON value, which suggests that the response might be HTML or XML.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Check the URL of your API call: Make sure that the URL you're using in your Blazor app matches the route of your API controller. In your case, the URL should be "/api/Employee/Index". 

2. Check the response from your API: You can use a tool like Postman to send a request to your API and see what the response looks like. If the response is not valid JSON, you'll need to fix this in your API code.

3. Check the data returned by your API: The data returned by your API needs to match the structure of your Employee class in your Blazor app. If there are any mismatches, you'll need to fix these.

4. Check the HTTP method: You're using a GET request in your Blazor app, so make sure your API method is also a GET method.

5. Check the server logs: If you're still having trouble, check the server logs for any errors or warnings that might help you diagnose the problem.

If you've checked all of these and you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your API code and the structure of your Employee class.
