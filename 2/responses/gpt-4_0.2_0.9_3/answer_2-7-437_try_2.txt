In Xdebug 3, several configuration settings have been changed or removed. The settings you mentioned have been replaced with the following:

- `xdebug.remote_enable` is replaced by `xdebug.mode=debug`
- `xdebug.remote_host` is replaced by `xdebug.client_host`
- `xdebug.remote_mode` is removed, and the default mode is now 'request'
- `xdebug.remote_port` is replaced by `xdebug.client_port`

You can add these settings in your php.ini file. If you can't find the file, you can create a new one. Here is an example of how you can set these configurations:

```
zend_extension=xdebug.so
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
xdebug.start_with_request=yes
```

Please replace `xdebug.so` with the correct path to your Xdebug extension if necessary. The `xdebug.start_with_request=yes` setting means that Xdebug will attempt to connect to the debugging client as soon as the script starts.

After changing the php.ini file, don't forget to restart your web server to apply the changes. 

In PhpStorm, you should also update the Xdebug port to 9003 (File | Settings | Languages & Frameworks | PHP | Debug | Xdebug for Windows/Linux or PhpStorm | Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | PHP | Debug | Xdebug for macOS).
