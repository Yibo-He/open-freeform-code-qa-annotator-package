The `AbstractMethodError` is thrown when an application tries to call an abstract method. Normally, this error is caught by the compiler; this error can only occur at run time if the definition of some class has incompatibly changed since the currently executing method was last compiled.

In your case, it seems like there's a version mismatch between the libraries you're using. The `hamcrest` library is used by `rest-assured` and it seems like there's a conflict between the versions of `hamcrest` that `rest-assured` and `spring-mock-mvc` are using.

To resolve this issue, you can try to exclude the `hamcrest` library from the `spring-mock-mvc` dependency in your `pom.xml` file like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.rest-assured</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-mock-mvc</artifactId>
    <version>4.3.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <exclusions>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
            <artifactId>hamcrest-core</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
        <exclusion>
            <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
            <artifactId>hamcrest-library</artifactId>
        </exclusion>
    </exclusions>
</dependency>
```

Then, add the `hamcrest` library as a separate dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.hamcrest</groupId>
    <artifactId>hamcrest</artifactId>
    <version>2.2</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

After making these changes, run `mvn clean install` to clean your project and download the correct dependencies. Then, try running your tests again.
