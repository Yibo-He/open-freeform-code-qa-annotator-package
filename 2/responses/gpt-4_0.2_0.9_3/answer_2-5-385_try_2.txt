The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the Android Gradle Plugin with version '7.1.2'. This could be due to several reasons, such as an incorrect configuration in your build.gradle files, or a network issue preventing Gradle from downloading the plugin from the specified repositories.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Android Studio version**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Android Studio Arctic Fox (2020.3.1) or later, which supports Android Gradle Plugin 7.0.0 and above.

2. **Check your Android Gradle Plugin version**: The error message indicates that it's looking for version '7.1.2', which might not be available yet. As of now, the latest stable version is '7.0.2'. You can change this in your project-level build.gradle file:

```groovy
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.0.2'
}
```

3. **Check your Gradle version**: Android Gradle Plugin '7.0.2' requires Gradle 7.0.2 or higher. You can specify the Gradle version in your gradle-wrapper.properties file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

4. **Check your repositories**: Make sure you have google() and mavenCentral() in both your buildscript and allprojects repositories in your project-level build.gradle file:

```groovy
buildscript {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
    ...
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }
}
```

5. **Sync your project**: After making these changes, try to sync your project again with Gradle files.

6. **Check your network connection**: If you're still having issues, it might be a network problem. Check your internet connection and try again. If you're behind a proxy, you might need to configure your proxy settings for Gradle.

7. **Invalidate caches / Restart**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try to invalidate caches and restart Android Studio. You can find this option in the 'File' menu.

Remember to always keep your Android Studio and Android Gradle Plugin updated to the latest stable versions to avoid such issues.
