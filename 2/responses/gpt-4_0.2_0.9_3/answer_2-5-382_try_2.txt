The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `Slider` class from the Material Components library is not available in the version you're using (`1.2.0-alpha02`). The `Slider` class was introduced in version `1.2.0-alpha05`.

However, you mentioned that you're using `1.2.0-alpha02` because of a rendering problem with the Navigation Drawer Layout. This is likely due to a bug in that specific version of the library. 

Here's what you can do to resolve this issue:

1. Update the Material Components library to the latest stable version (`1.3.0` at the time of writing). This version should contain both the `Slider` class and the fix for the Navigation Drawer Layout rendering issue. 

   Replace this line in your `build.gradle` file:

   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.2.0-alpha02'
   ```

   with:

   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.google.android.material:material:1.3.0'
   ```

2. Clean and rebuild your project. You can do this by selecting `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` from the Android Studio menu.

3. If you're still encountering the rendering issue with the Navigation Drawer Layout, try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by selecting `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart` from the Android Studio menu.

If you're still encountering issues after following these steps, please provide more details about the rendering problem with the Navigation Drawer Layout, and I'll be happy to help you further.
