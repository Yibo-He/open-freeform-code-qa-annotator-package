The issue you're facing is likely due to the incorrect path in your import statement. Protobuf compiler `protoc` uses the `src/main/proto` directory as the root directory for imports. 

So, you should change your import statement from:

```protobuf
import "tech/tablesaw/service/common/column_type.proto";
```

to:

```protobuf
import "column_type.proto";
```

This is because both `column_metadata.proto` and `column_type.proto` are in the same directory, so you don't need to specify the full path.

Also, make sure that the `src/main/proto` directory is correctly configured in your `build.gradle` file. You should have something like this in your `protobuf` block:

```groovy
protobuf {
    protoc { artifact = "com.google.protobuf:protoc:${protocVersion}" }
    plugins {
        grpc { artifact = "io.grpc:protoc-gen-grpc-java:${grpcVersion}" }
    }
    generateProtoTasks {
        all()*.plugins { grpc {} }
    }
    generatedFilesBaseDir = "$projectDir/src/generated"
    srcDir 'src/main/proto'
}
```

This tells Gradle to look for your `.proto` files in the `src/main/proto` directory.
