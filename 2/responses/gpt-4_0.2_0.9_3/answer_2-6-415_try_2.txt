The error message you're seeing is a `FieldAccessException` which means that the application is trying to access a field that it doesn't have access to. In this case, it's the `ZIndexProperty` field of the `VisualElement` class.

The error message also indicates that the error is happening during the `InitializeComponent` method of your `Login` view. This method is usually auto-generated and is responsible for initializing the components of your view.

Here are a few things you can try to solve this issue:

1. **Check your XAML file**: The `InitializeComponent` method is usually auto-generated based on your XAML file. Make sure there are no typos or incorrect bindings in your XAML file that could be causing this issue.

2. **Check your ViewModel**: The error message indicates that the error is happening in the `LoginViewModel`. Make sure that you're not trying to access any fields or properties that you don't have access to in this ViewModel.

3. **Check your Dependency Injection setup**: The error message also indicates that the error is happening during the dependency injection setup. Make sure that you're correctly registering all your services and ViewModels in the `MauiProgram` class.

4. **Try cleaning and rebuilding your solution**: Sometimes, these kinds of errors can be caused by stale build artifacts. Try cleaning your solution and then rebuilding it to see if that solves the issue.

5. **Check your linker settings**: The linker can sometimes cause issues when it removes code that it thinks is not being used, but is actually necessary. Try changing your linker settings to see if that solves the issue. You can do this by going to the properties of your project, then going to the "Android Options" tab and changing the "Linking" option to "None".

6. **Update your NuGet packages and MAUI version**: Sometimes, these kinds of issues can be caused by bugs in the libraries you're using. Try updating all your NuGet packages and your MAUI version to the latest version to see if that solves the issue.
