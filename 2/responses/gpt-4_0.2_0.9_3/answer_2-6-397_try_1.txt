The behavior you're experiencing seems to be related to the new Hot Reload feature in .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022. Even though you've disabled Browser Link, the Hot Reload feature might still be active.

Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Disable Hot Reload in Visual Studio 2022:**

   - Go to `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > ASP.NET Core`
   - Uncheck the `Enable .NET Hot Reload on file save` option

2. **Disable Hot Reload in launchSettings.json:**

   - Open the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in your project
   - Under the `iisSettings` section, add `"hotReloadProfile": "Off"` to the `iisExpress` profile

Here's an example:

```json
"iisSettings": {
  "windowsAuthentication": false,
  "anonymousAuthentication": true,
  "iisExpress": {
    "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:12345",
    "sslPort": 0,
    "hotReloadProfile": "Off"
  }
}
```

3. **Disable Hot Reload in the .csproj file:**

   - Open your .csproj file
   - Add the following PropertyGroup:

```xml
<PropertyGroup>
  <DisableHotReload>true</DisableHotReload>
</PropertyGroup>
```

After making these changes, restart Visual Studio and run your project again. The Hot Reload feature should be disabled, and the scripts should no longer be injected into your HTML.

If the issue persists, it might be a bug in Visual Studio 2022 or .NET 6. In that case, you might want to report it to Microsoft via the Visual Studio Feedback tool.
