Go test uses caching to avoid running unnecessary tests. If the test binary and all its inputs remain unchanged, the test will be skipped, and the previous result will be used instead.

If you want to disable test caching, you can use the `-count=1` flag. This will force the tests to run every time:

```
go test -count=1 ./...
```

The `-count` flag sets the number of times to run each test. If you set it to 1, it will disable caching and run the test every time.
