The error message you're seeing indicates that the `--add-opens` option is not recognized. This option is a JVM argument that is used to open certain modules for deep reflection. It was introduced in Java 9, and is not available in Java 8, which you're currently using.

Hyperledger Besu requires Java 11 or later to run. The version you're currently using, Java 1.8.0_241, is not compatible with Hyperledger Besu. 

To resolve this issue, you need to upgrade your Java version to at least Java 11. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Uninstall your current version of Java.
2. Download and install Java 11 or later. You can download it from the official Oracle website or use OpenJDK.
3. Verify the installation by running `java -version` in the command line. The output should show the version number that is 11 or later.
4. Try running the `bin\besu --help` command again. It should now work without any errors.

If you still encounter issues after upgrading Java, please let me know.
