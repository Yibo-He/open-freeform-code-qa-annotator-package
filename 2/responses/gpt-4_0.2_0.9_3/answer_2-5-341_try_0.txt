The error message you're seeing is indicating that Spring Boot doesn't know how to convert your `Pet` object into XML. This is because, by default, Spring Boot only configures a converter for JSON.

To enable XML support, you need to add the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
implementation 'com.fasterxml.jackson.dataformat:jackson-dataformat-xml'
```

This will add the Jackson XML data format library to your project, which includes a `HttpMessageConverter` that can convert objects to XML.

After you've added this dependency, Spring Boot should automatically configure a converter for XML, and your XML endpoint should start working.

If it still doesn't work, you can manually configure an XML converter by adding the following bean to one of your configuration classes:

```java
@Bean
public MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter mappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter() {
    MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter xmlConverter = new MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter();
    xmlConverter.setObjectMapper(new XmlMapper());
    return xmlConverter;
}
```

This will create a `MappingJackson2XmlHttpMessageConverter` bean that Spring Boot can use to convert objects to XML. The `XmlMapper` is a Jackson class that knows how to convert objects to XML and vice versa.
