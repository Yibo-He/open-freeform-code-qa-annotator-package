The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA and the version of Maven used in your Spring Boot project. 

The error message indicates that IntelliJ IDEA's Maven integration is trying to use a class (`org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator`) that doesn't exist in the version of Maven bundled with IntelliJ IDEA.

Here are a few possible solutions:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA**: JetBrains regularly releases updates to IntelliJ IDEA that include fixes for known issues. Check if there's an update available for your version of IntelliJ IDEA.

2. **Change the bundled Maven version in IntelliJ IDEA**: You can configure IntelliJ IDEA to use a different version of Maven. Go to `File -> Settings -> Build, Execution, Deployment -> Build Tools -> Maven`. In the `Maven home directory` field, enter the path to the Maven installation you want to use.

3. **Downgrade the Maven version in your Spring Boot project**: If you can't change the version of Maven used by IntelliJ IDEA, you could try downgrading the version of Maven used in your Spring Boot project. You can do this by changing the version specified in the `pom.xml` file.

Remember to re-import the project in IntelliJ IDEA after making these changes.
