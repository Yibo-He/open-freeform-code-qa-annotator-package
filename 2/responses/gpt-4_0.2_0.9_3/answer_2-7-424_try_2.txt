The error message you're seeing typically indicates that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory.

Laravel stores its cache files in the `bootstrap/cache/` directory. If the user running the command doesn't have write permissions for this directory, Laravel won't be able to delete the cache files and you'll see the error message you described.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Check the permissions on the `bootstrap/cache/` directory. You can do this by running `ls -la bootstrap/cache/` from the root directory of your Laravel project. The user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command needs to have write permissions for this directory.

2. If the permissions are incorrect, you can change them using the `chmod` command. For example, `chmod -R 755 bootstrap/cache/` will give the owner of the files read, write, and execute permissions, and everyone else read and execute permissions.

3. If you're not sure which user is running the command, you can find out by running `whoami` in the terminal.

4. If the user running the command is not the owner of the files, you can change the owner using the `chown` command. For example, `chown -R user:group bootstrap/cache/` will change the owner of the files to `user` and the group to `group`.

5. If you're running the command as a superuser or with sudo, make sure that the user has the necessary sudo privileges.

Remember to replace `user:group` with the actual username and groupname that you're using in your system.
