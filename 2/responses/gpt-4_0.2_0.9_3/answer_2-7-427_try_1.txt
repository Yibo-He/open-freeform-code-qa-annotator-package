The error message you're seeing is typically related to a mismatch between the encryption type you're using and what the server is expecting. 

In your `.env` file, you've set `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl`, but in your `mail.php` file, you're defaulting to `tls` if the `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` environment variable isn't set. 

The port number you're using, 587, is typically used for `tls` encryption, not `ssl`. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Change `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl` to `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls` in your `.env` file. 

2. If that doesn't work, try changing `MAIL_PORT=587` to `MAIL_PORT=465` in your `.env` file. Port 465 is typically used for `ssl` encryption.

3. If neither of those work, it's possible that the server is expecting a different type of encryption or no encryption at all. You might try setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null` in your `.env` file.

Remember to clear the config cache each time you make changes to your `.env` file. You can do this with the command `php artisan config:cache`.

If none of these suggestions work, you may need to contact the email server administrator or the hosting provider for more specific information about the type of encryption and port number they're using.
