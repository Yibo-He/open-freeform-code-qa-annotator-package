In your case, you are using a `@PathVariable` which is a part of the URL itself, and a `@RequestBody` which is the body of the HTTP request.

To send a request using Postman, follow these steps:

1. Set the HTTP method to POST.
2. In the URL field, enter the URL of your endpoint. For example, if your server is running locally on port 8080, and you want to send a request to the `api/v1/customers` endpoint with a `code` of `123`, you would enter `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/123`.
3. In the `Body` tab, select `raw` and `JSON` from the dropdown menu.
4. Enter your `CustomerDTO` object in JSON format in the text field. For example:
```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```
5. Click `Send` to send the request.

This will send a POST request to your server with the `code` as a path variable and the `CustomerDTO` object as the request body. The server should then print the `CustomerDTO` object and the `code` to the console.
