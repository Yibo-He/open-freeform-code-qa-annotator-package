The `AbstractController::getDoctrine()` method is deprecated since Symfony 4.2. The alternative is to inject the Doctrine service into your controller methods.

Here's an example:

Before (with `AbstractController::getDoctrine()`):

```php
public function index()
{
    $em = $this->getDoctrine()->getManager();
    // ...
}
```

After (with dependency injection):

```php
use Doctrine\ORM\EntityManagerInterface;

public function index(EntityManagerInterface $em)
{
    // ...
}
```

In the new approach, you directly ask for the `EntityManagerInterface` service in the method where you need it, and Symfony will automatically inject it for you. This is a more explicit way of declaring your dependencies and it makes your code easier to test and more flexible.
