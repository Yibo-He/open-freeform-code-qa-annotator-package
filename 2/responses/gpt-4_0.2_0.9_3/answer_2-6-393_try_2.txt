The error message is indicating that the `OpenReadStream` method is returning a stream that does not support synchronous reads, which is what `Image.Load` is trying to do. 

To resolve this, you need to read the stream asynchronously into a byte array, and then load the image from that byte array. Here is how you can modify your method:

```csharp
public async Task<byte[]> ConvertFileToByteArrayAsync(IBrowserFile file)
{
    // Read the stream asynchronously into a byte array
    var ms = new MemoryStream();
    await file.OpenReadStream().CopyToAsync(ms);
    var fileBytes = ms.ToArray();

    // Load the image from the byte array
    using var image = Image.Load(fileBytes);
    image.Mutate(x => x.Resize(new ResizeOptions
    {
        Mode = ResizeMode.Min,
        Size = new Size(128)
    }));

    MemoryStream memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
    if (file.ContentType == "image/png")
    {
        await image.SaveAsPngAsync(memoryStream);
    }
    else
    {
        await image.SaveAsJpegAsync(memoryStream);
    }
    var byteFile = memoryStream.ToArray();
    memoryStream.Close();
    memoryStream.Dispose();

    return byteFile;
}
```

This way, you are performing the read operation asynchronously, which is supported by the stream returned by `OpenReadStream`. After that, you can load the image from the byte array, which does not require any stream operations.
