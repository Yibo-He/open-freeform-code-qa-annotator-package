In a .NET 6 console application, you can't use `WebApplication.CreateBuilder(args)` because it's specific to ASP.NET Core web applications. However, you can still read the `appsettings.json` file using `ConfigurationBuilder`. Here's how you can do it:

First, make sure you have these packages installed:
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration
- Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json

Then, you can use the following code to read the `appsettings.json` file:

```csharp
var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();

// Now you can access your settings.
string mySetting = configuration["MySetting"];
```

In this code, `SetBasePath(Directory.GetCurrentDirectory())` sets the base path to the current directory, and `AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)` adds the `appsettings.json` file to the configuration builder.

After building the configuration, you can access your settings using the indexer with the key of the setting.

Please make sure that your `appsettings.json` file is set to copy to the output directory. You can do this by right-clicking the file in Solution Explorer, selecting Properties, and then setting Copy to Output Directory to Copy if newer.
