In your case, where you don't have any synchronous cleanup to do, you can leave the Dispose(bool) method empty. The Dispose() method is there to clean up any managed resources in a synchronous way. If you don't have any, there's no need to put anything there.

However, you should still implement it, because it's part of the IDisposable interface and the dispose pattern. It's also a good practice to keep it there in case you need to add synchronous cleanup in the future.

Here is how your code should look:

```csharp
public class MyClass : IDisposable, IAsyncDisposable
{
    private bool disposed;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        await DisposeAsyncCore().ConfigureAwait(false);

        Dispose(false);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            if (disposing)
            {
                // Nothing to clean up
            }

            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    protected virtual async ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore()
    {
        // Make async cleanup call here e.g. Database.CleanupAsync();
    }
}
```

Remember, the Dispose(bool) method is called by both Dispose() and DisposeAsync() methods. The boolean parameter 'disposing' is used to determine whether the method was called from a Dispose method (true), or a finalizer (false). In your case, since you don't have a finalizer, you can ignore this parameter.
