The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between the version of Maven bundled with Spring Boot 2.7 and the version of Maven supported by your current version of IntelliJ IDEA.

The error message indicates that IntelliJ is trying to use a method in the `org.apache.maven.model.validation.DefaultModelValidator` class that doesn't exist in the version of Maven bundled with your Spring Boot project. This is likely because your version of IntelliJ is expecting a different version of Maven.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Update IntelliJ IDEA:** JetBrains regularly updates IntelliJ IDEA to support the latest versions of Maven. If you're not using the latest version of IntelliJ, updating might resolve the issue.

2. **Downgrade Spring Boot:** If you can't update IntelliJ or if updating doesn't resolve the issue, you might need to use a version of Spring Boot that bundles a version of Maven compatible with your version of IntelliJ. You can select the version of Spring Boot when generating a project on start.spring.io.

3. **Override the Maven version:** Another option is to override the version of Maven used by your project. You can do this by modifying the `pom.xml` file in your project. However, this might cause other issues if Spring Boot 2.7 relies on features only available in Maven 3.8.5.

Remember to always keep your tools up to date to avoid such issues. If none of these solutions work, you might need to reach out to JetBrains support for help.
