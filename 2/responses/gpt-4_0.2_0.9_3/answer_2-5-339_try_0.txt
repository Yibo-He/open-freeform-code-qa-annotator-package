The error you're seeing is likely due to a compatibility issue between the Gradle version you're using and the version of the Android Gradle plugin. 

The error message `java.lang.AbstractMethodError: org.jetbrains.plugins.gradle.tooling.util.ModuleComponentIdentifierImpl.getModuleIdentifier()Lorg/gradle/api/artifacts/ModuleIdentifier;` suggests that a method is being called that doesn't exist in the version of the class that is loaded in the runtime. This is a common symptom of version mismatches.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Help > Check for Updates...` in the Android Studio menu.

2. **Update Android Gradle plugin**: In your project-level `build.gradle` file, make sure the version of the Android Gradle plugin (`com.android.tools.build:gradle`) is compatible with your Gradle version. For Gradle 5.0, you should use Android Gradle plugin 3.3.0 or later. Here's an example of how to specify the version:

    ```gradle
    buildscript {
        dependencies {
            classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Update Gradle Wrapper**: In your `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` file, make sure the `distributionUrl` is set to use Gradle 5.0. Here's an example:

    ```properties
    distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.0-all.zip
    ```

4. **Clean and Rebuild Project**: After making these changes, try to clean and rebuild your project. You can do this by going to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project` in the Android Studio menu.

5. **Invalidate Caches and Restart**: If the problem persists, you can try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by going to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, please provide more details about your project configuration, including the versions of Android Studio, Gradle, and the Android Gradle plugin you're using.
