The error message you're seeing is due to a mismatch between the version of Entity Framework you're using and the .NET version of your project. Entity Framework 6.4.4 is not compatible with .NET 6.0. 

For .NET 6.0, you should use Entity Framework Core. Entity Framework Core is a modern, lightweight, extensible, and cross-platform version of Entity Framework. 

Here are the steps to install Entity Framework Core:

1. Open your project in Visual Studio 2022.

2. Right-click on your project in Solution Explorer and select "Manage NuGet Packages".

3. In the NuGet Package Manager, click on "Browse" and search for "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore".

4. Select the package and install it. Make sure to select a version that is compatible with .NET 6.0 (5.0.0 or later).

5. Repeat the process for "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design" and "Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer" if you're using SQL Server.

6. After installing these packages, you should be able to use Entity Framework Core in your project.

Remember, the APIs of Entity Framework 6 and Entity Framework Core are different, so you may need to adjust your code accordingly.
