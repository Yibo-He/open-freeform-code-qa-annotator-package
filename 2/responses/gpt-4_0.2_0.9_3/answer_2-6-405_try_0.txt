The issue you're facing is related to the way ASP.NET Core's JSON serializer works. It only serializes properties, not fields. In your `City` class, you've defined `CityName`, `AssociatedCities`, `Province`, and `Status` as fields, not properties. 

To resolve this issue, you should change these fields to properties. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
public class City
{
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public string AssociatedCities { get; set; } 
    public string Province { get; set; }
    public int Status { get; set; }

    public City(string cityName, string associatedCities, string province, int status)
    {
        this.CityName = cityName;
        this.AssociatedCities = associatedCities;
        this.Province = province;
        this.Status = status;
    }
}
```

In C#, properties are defined with `{ get; set; }` syntax, which creates a getter and a setter method for the property. These methods are used to retrieve and update the value of the property, respectively. 

After making these changes, your API should return the expected JSON response.
