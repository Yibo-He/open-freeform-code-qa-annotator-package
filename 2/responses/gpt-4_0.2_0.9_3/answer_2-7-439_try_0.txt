The `ext-zip` is a PHP extension, not a Composer package. That's why you can't install it using `composer require ext-zip`.

You need to install it via your PHP installation. If you're using a Unix-like operating system, you can install it via `pecl` or `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install php-zip
```

or

```bash
pecl install zip
```

If you're using Windows, you can enable it in your `php.ini` file by uncommenting or adding the line:

```ini
extension=php_zip.dll
```

After installing the extension, you should add it to your `composer.json` file to ensure that it's required for your project:

```json
{
    "require": {
        "php": "^7.1",
        "ext-zip": "*"
    }
}
```

Then run `composer update` to update your project dependencies.

Remember to restart your web server after installing the extension.
