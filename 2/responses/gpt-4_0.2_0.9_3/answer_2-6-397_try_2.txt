The behavior you're experiencing is indeed related to Visual Studio 2022's automatic integration with ASP.NET Core development. The "magic" you're referring to is the automatic injection of middleware into your application's pipeline when running in the development environment.

The `Microsoft.AspNetCore.Watch.BrowserRefresh.BrowserRefreshMiddleware` and `Microsoft.WebTools.BrowserLink.Net.BrowserLinkMiddleware` middlewares are added by Visual Studio and IIS Express to enable features like Browser Link and Hot Reload.

To disable this behavior, you can try the following steps:

1. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in Visual Studio Options:**
   - Go to `Tools > Options > Projects and Solutions > ASP.NET Core`.
   - Uncheck the `Enable Browser Link` and `Enable Hot Reload` options.

2. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in launchSettings.json:**
   - Open the `Properties/launchSettings.json` file in your project.
   - In the `iisSettings` section, set `windowsAuthentication`, `anonymousAuthentication`, and `enableBrowserLink` to `false`.
   - In the profiles section for your project, set `launchBrowser` to `false`.

Here's an example of how your `launchSettings.json` file might look:

```json
{
  "iisSettings": {
    "windowsAuthentication": false,
    "anonymousAuthentication": false,
    "iisExpress": {
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:12345",
      "sslPort": 0
    }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "YourProjectName": {
      "commandName": "Project",
      "launchBrowser": false,
      "environmentVariables": {
        "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development"
      },
      "applicationUrl": "http://localhost:54321"
    }
  }
}
```

3. **Disable Browser Link and Hot Reload in your Startup.cs:**
   - In your `Startup.cs` file, remove or comment out any calls to `app.UseBrowserLink()`.

After making these changes, you should restart Visual Studio and your web server to ensure the changes take effect. If you're still experiencing the issue, it might be a bug in Visual Studio 2022, and you should consider reporting it to Microsoft.
