It seems like you're dealing with a situation where you want to handle session expiration gracefully, specifically when a user clicks on the logout button. Here's a general step-by-step process of how you can handle this:

1. **User Clicks Logout**: The first step is triggered when the user clicks the logout button. This sends a request to the server to end the session.

2. **Check Session Validity**: Before processing the logout request, the server checks if the session is still valid. This is usually done by checking a session ID or token that was issued when the user logged in.

3. **Session Expired**: If the session has already expired (either due to inactivity or because it was manually ended), the server will typically return an error message. This is what you're trying to avoid.

4. **Handle Session Expiration Gracefully**: Instead of returning an error when the session is already expired, you can modify your server-side code to simply return a successful logout response. This way, from the user's perspective, they were logged out successfully, whether their session was already expired or not.

5. **Client-Side Handling**: On the client side, when the logout request is made, you can handle the response from the server. If it's a success message (which it will always be with the above modification), you can redirect the user to the login page or a confirmation page that they've been logged out.

6. **Clear Client-Side Session Data**: As an additional step, you may want to clear any session data stored on the client side (like in cookies or local storage) when the logout button is clicked, regardless of whether the session on the server is expired or not.

Remember, the specifics of this process may vary depending on the programming language and framework you're using.
