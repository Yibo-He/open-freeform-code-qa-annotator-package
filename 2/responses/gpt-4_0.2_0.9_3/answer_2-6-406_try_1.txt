In a .NET 6 console application, you don't have the `WebApplication` class available. Instead, you can use the `ConfigurationBuilder` to load the `appsettings.json` file. Here is an example:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration;
using System;

var builder = new ConfigurationBuilder()
    .SetBasePath(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory)
    .AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true);

IConfiguration configuration = builder.Build();

// Now you can access your settings.
string mySetting = configuration["MySetting"];
```

In this code:

- `SetBasePath(AppDomain.CurrentDomain.BaseDirectory)` sets the base path for the configuration file to the directory where the application is running.
- `AddJsonFile("appsettings.json", optional: true, reloadOnChange: true)` adds the `appsettings.json` file to the configuration. The `optional` parameter is set to `true` to avoid throwing an exception if the file is not found, and `reloadOnChange` is set to `true` to reload the configuration if the file changes while the application is running.
- `configuration["MySetting"]` retrieves the value of `MySetting` from the configuration. Replace `"MySetting"` with the actual key of the setting you want to retrieve.

Remember to add the `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration` and `Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Json` NuGet packages to your project if they are not already included.
