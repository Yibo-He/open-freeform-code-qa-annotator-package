The error is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Indexes can only be created on scalar properties, not on navigation properties.

Here's how you can fix it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId); // Create index on GenderId, not Gender
    });
}
```

In this code, instead of creating an index on `Gender`, you're creating it on `GenderId`, which is a scalar property.
