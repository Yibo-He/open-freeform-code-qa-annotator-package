The issue with your code is the empty `else if` statement. It's considered bad form because it can lead to confusion and potential bugs. Even though it may seem to make sense in your context, it's generally not a good practice to leave empty blocks of code as it can be misleading to others reading your code.

In your case, you can simply remove the empty `else if` statement and the logic of your code will remain the same. Here's how you can rewrite it:

```csharp
if (!seesWater(LEFT))
{
    turn(LEFT);
}
else if (!seesWater(RIGHT))
{
    turn(RIGHT);
}
else if (seesWater(AHEAD))
{
    // Do nothing
}
else
{
    turn180();
}
```

In this version, if `seesWater(AHEAD)` is true, then the code does nothing and skips to the next condition. This maintains your priority order and avoids the empty `else if` statement.
