The error message is indicating that the `Image.Load` method is trying to perform a synchronous read on the stream provided by `file.OpenReadStream()`, which is not supported. 

To fix this issue, you can read the stream asynchronously into a byte array and then load the image from the byte array. Here's how you can modify your method:

```csharp
public async Task<byte[]> ConvertFileToByteArrayAsync(IBrowserFile file)
{
    byte[] fileBytes;

    await using (var ms = new MemoryStream())
    {
        await file.OpenReadStream().CopyToAsync(ms);
        fileBytes = ms.ToArray();
    }

    using var image = Image.Load(fileBytes);
    image.Mutate(x => x.Resize(new ResizeOptions
    {
        Mode = ResizeMode.Min,
        Size = new Size(128)
    }));

    var memoryStream = new MemoryStream();
    if (file.ContentType == "image/png")
    {
        await image.SaveAsPngAsync(memoryStream);
    }
    else
    {
        await image.SaveAsJpegAsync(memoryStream);
    }
    var byteFile = memoryStream.ToArray();

    return byteFile;
}
```

In this version of the method, `file.OpenReadStream().CopyToAsync(ms)` is used to asynchronously copy the contents of the file's stream into a `MemoryStream`. The `MemoryStream` is then converted to a byte array, which is used to load the image.
