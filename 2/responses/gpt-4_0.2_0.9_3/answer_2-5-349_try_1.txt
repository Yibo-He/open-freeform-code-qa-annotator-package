In Postman, you can send a path variable in a POST request as follows:

1. Open Postman.
2. Select POST from the dropdown list.
3. In the URL field, enter the URL of your API endpoint. Replace `{code}` with the actual value you want to send. For example, if your server is running on localhost port 8080, and you want to send `123` as the `code`, you would enter: `http://localhost:8080/api/v1/customers/123`.
4. In the `Body` tab, select `raw` and `JSON` from the dropdown list.
5. Enter the JSON representation of your `CustomerDTO` object in the text field. For example:

```json
{
    "name": "John Doe",
    "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

6. Click the `Send` button to send the request.

In your `postRequest` method, `@PathVariable String code` will receive the value from the URL, and `@RequestBody CustomerDTO dto` will receive the JSON object from the request body.
