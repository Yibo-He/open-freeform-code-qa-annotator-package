The Maven Wrapper is a shell script used to automatically download and install the correct version of Maven for your project. It's a good way to ensure that everyone working on your project is using the same version of Maven.

If you're having trouble with the Maven Wrapper using an older version of Java, it's likely because the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to point to that older version. The Maven Wrapper uses the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to find the Java installation to use.

Here's how you can change the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:

1. Open a terminal.
2. If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, enter the following command to open the bash profile file in a text editor:

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

If you're using Windows, you'll need to open the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button, then edit the `JAVA_HOME` variable in the System variables section.

3. Add the following line to the file, replacing `/path/to/java` with the path to your Java installation:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java
```

4. Save and close the file.
5. If you're using a Unix-based system, enter the following command to reload the bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, when you run the Maven Wrapper, it should use the correct version of Java.

If you want to avoid downloading JDK from a remote source, you can manually install the JDK on your machine and then point the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to that installation. You can download the JDK from the official Oracle website or use a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu or `brew` for MacOS.
