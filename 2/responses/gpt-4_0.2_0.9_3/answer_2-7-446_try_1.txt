It seems like you're having trouble installing Xdebug on your Mac M1. The steps you've followed seem correct, but there might be some issues that need to be addressed. 

Firstly, ensure that you have the correct path to the xdebug.so file. The path you've mentioned (`/opt/homebrew/lib/php/pecl/20190902/xdebug.so`) might be different on your system. You can find the correct path by running the command `find / -name 'xdebug.so' 2>/dev/null` in your terminal. This will search your entire system for the file 'xdebug.so' and output its location.

Secondly, the error message in the image you've provided suggests that the Xdebug extension cannot be loaded because it was compiled with a different API version. This typically happens when there's a mismatch between the PHP version used to compile the Xdebug extension and the PHP version currently running on your system.

You can check your PHP version by running `php -v` in your terminal. If the version doesn't match the one used to compile Xdebug (as indicated in the error message), you'll need to either upgrade/downgrade your PHP version or compile Xdebug with your current PHP version.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to consider using a package manager like Homebrew to install Xdebug. This can help to avoid version mismatches and other potential issues. Here's how you can do it:

1. If you haven't installed Homebrew yet, install it by running the following command in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install Xdebug by running:
```
brew install php@7.4
brew install php@7.4-xdebug
```
(Note: Replace 7.4 with your PHP version)

3. Then, add the following lines to your php.ini file:
```
zend_extension="xdebug.so"
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port="9003"
```

4. Finally, restart your server for the changes to take effect.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
