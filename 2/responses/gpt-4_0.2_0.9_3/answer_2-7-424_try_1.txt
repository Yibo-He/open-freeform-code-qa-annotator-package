The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions" suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command doesn't have the necessary permissions to modify the files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user running the command is not the owner of the files/directories. This can happen if the cache files were created by a different user or system process.

2. The file permissions are set in such a way that the user running the command doesn't have write access to the files/directories. This can happen if the permissions were changed manually or by a system process.

To fix this, you need to change the ownership and/or permissions of the cache files/directories to allow the user running the command to modify them. You can do this using the `chown` and `chmod` commands in the terminal.

For example, if your cache directory is located at `/path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache`, you can change the ownership to the current user with the following command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache
```

And then give the current user write permissions with the following command:

```bash
sudo chmod -R 755 /path/to/your/project/bootstrap/cache
```

Please replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your Laravel project.

After running these commands, try running `php artisan cache:clear` again and see if it works. If not, there might be other issues at play, such as problems with your Laravel or server configuration.
