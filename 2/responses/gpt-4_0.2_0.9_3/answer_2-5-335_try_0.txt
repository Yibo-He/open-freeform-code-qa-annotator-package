In Dart and Flutter, you can use the `print()` function to log data to the console. However, sometimes the IDE console might not display the logs properly. 

Here's how you can print to the console in Dart/Flutter:

```dart
print('Hello, Console');
```

If you're not seeing any output in IntelliJ IDEA, it might be because of the following reasons:

1. You're looking at the wrong console. In IntelliJ IDEA, there are multiple places where console output can appear. Make sure you're looking at the right one. For a Flutter app, you should be looking at the "Run" tab.

2. Your app might not be running in debug mode. Make sure you're running your app in debug mode to see console output.

3. There might be an issue with your IntelliJ IDEA setup. Try restarting IntelliJ IDEA or invalidating the cache and restarting (File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart).

4. If you're using an emulator or a real device, try to check the logs using the 'adb logcat' command in the terminal. This will show you all the logs from your device.

If none of these work, you might want to consider using a logging package like `logger`. This package provides a nice, clean way to log messages and includes additional features like logging levels and log formatting.
