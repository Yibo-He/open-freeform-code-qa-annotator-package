The error you're getting is because you're trying to convert a string to a rune, which is not allowed. A rune in Go is a type that represents a Unicode code point. 

If you want to convert an integer to its ASCII representation, you can do it like this:

```go
a := 42
fmt.Printf("%c", a) // prints *
```

This will print the ASCII character that corresponds to the number 42, which is '*'.

If you want to convert a string that represents a number to its ASCII representation, you can do it like this:

```go
a := "42"
i, err := strconv.Atoi(a)
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
} else {
    fmt.Printf("%c", i) // prints *
}
```

This will convert the string "42" to the integer 42, and then print the ASCII character that corresponds to that number.
