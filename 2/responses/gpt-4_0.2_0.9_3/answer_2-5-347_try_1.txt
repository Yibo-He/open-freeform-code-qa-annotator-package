The error message suggests that there are conflicts in the installation area that the patch cannot resolve. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as file permissions, corrupted files, or other software conflicts.

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Backup your settings**: Before you proceed, it's a good idea to backup your settings. You can do this by going to `File > Export Settings`.

2. **Uninstall the current version**: Uninstall the current version of IntelliJ IDEA. You can do this by deleting the IntelliJ IDEA directory. This is usually located in the `/opt` directory or in your home directory. You can use the command `sudo rm -r /path/to/intellij/idea` to do this.

3. **Download the new version**: Download the new version of IntelliJ IDEA from the official website. Here is the link: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=linux

4. **Install the new version**: To install the new version, extract the downloaded file to your preferred location (usually the `/opt` directory). You can use the command `sudo tar -xzf ideaIC-2020.3.tar.gz -C /opt/` to do this. Replace `ideaIC-2020.3.tar.gz` with the name of the file you downloaded.

5. **Run IntelliJ IDEA**: You can run IntelliJ IDEA by navigating to the bin directory and running the `idea.sh` file. You can use the command `cd /opt/idea-IC-203.5981.155/bin/ && ./idea.sh` to do this. Replace `idea-IC-203.5981.155` with the name of the directory that was created when you extracted the file.

6. **Import your settings**: If you exported your settings, you can now import them by going to `File > Import Settings`.

Remember to replace the paths and filenames in the commands with the actual paths and filenames on your system.
