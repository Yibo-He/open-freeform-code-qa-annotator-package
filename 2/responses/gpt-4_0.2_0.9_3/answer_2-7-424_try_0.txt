The error message "Failed to clear cache. Make sure you have the appropriate permissions." suggests that the user running the `php artisan cache:clear` command does not have the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The user running the command does not own the files in the cache directory.
2. The files in the cache directory are not writable by the user running the command.
3. The cache directory itself is not writable by the user running the command.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the user running the command has the necessary permissions to delete the files in the cache directory. This can usually be achieved by changing the ownership of the files and/or changing the permissions of the files.

Here are some commands that might help:

- To change the ownership of the files, you can use the `chown` command. For example, if the user running the command is `user1` and the cache directory is located at `/path/to/cache`, you can run `sudo chown -R user1 /path/to/cache`.

- To change the permissions of the files, you can use the `chmod` command. For example, to make the files in the cache directory writable by the user, you can run `sudo chmod -R u+w /path/to/cache`.

Please replace `user1` and `/path/to/cache` with your actual username and the path to your cache directory.

Remember to be careful when changing file ownership and permissions, as incorrect settings can potentially lead to security issues.
