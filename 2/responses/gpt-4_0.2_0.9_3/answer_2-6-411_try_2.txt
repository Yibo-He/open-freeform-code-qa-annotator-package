In your case, since you don't have any synchronous cleanup to do, you can leave the `Dispose(bool disposing)` method empty. The `Dispose()` method is there to provide a synchronous cleanup mechanism for any managed or unmanaged resources. If you don't have any such resources to clean up, there's no need to put anything in there.

However, it's important to note that if your class is inherited by another class in the future, and that class has some synchronous cleanup to do, it can override `Dispose(bool disposing)` and put its cleanup logic there.

So, your code would look like this:

```csharp
public class MyClass : IDisposable, IAsyncDisposable
{
    private bool disposed;

    public void Dispose()
    {
        Dispose(true);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    public async ValueTask DisposeAsync()
    {
        await DisposeAsyncCore().ConfigureAwait(false);

        Dispose(false);
        GC.SuppressFinalize(this);
    }

    protected virtual void Dispose(bool disposing)
    {
        if (!disposed)
        {
            // Nothing to clean up here
            disposed = true;
        }
    }

    protected virtual async ValueTask DisposeAsyncCore()
    {
        // Make async cleanup call here e.g. Database.CleanupAsync();
    }
}
```

Remember, the `Dispose()` method is still important to implement because it allows your class to be used correctly with interfaces or code that only understands `IDisposable` and not `IAsyncDisposable`.
