The error message you're seeing is usually due to a mismatch between the encryption type specified in your configuration and what the SMTP server actually supports. 

In your `.env` file, you've specified `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl`, but in your `mail.php` configuration file, you've specified `'encryption' => env('MAIL_ENCRYPTION', 'tls')`. This means that if `MAIL_ENCRYPTION` is not set in your `.env` file, it will default to `'tls'`.

The port number you're using, 587, is typically used for TLS encryption, not SSL. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Change `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=ssl` in your `.env` file to `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=tls` and see if that resolves the issue.

2. If that doesn't work, try changing `MAIL_PORT=587` in your `.env` file to `MAIL_PORT=465`, which is the port typically used for SSL encryption.

3. If neither of those work, it's possible that the SMTP server doesn't support encryption at all. In that case, you can try setting `MAIL_ENCRYPTION=null` in your `.env` file.

Remember to clear your config cache each time you make a change to your `.env` file by running `php artisan config:cache` in your terminal.

If none of these suggestions work, you may need to contact the administrator of the SMTP server to find out what settings you should be using.
