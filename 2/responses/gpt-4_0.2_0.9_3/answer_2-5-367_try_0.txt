You can use the `runOrder` parameter of the Maven Failsafe plugin to control the order in which tests are run. By default, this parameter is set to `filesystem`, which means that tests are run in the order they are discovered on the file system. However, you can set this parameter to `random`, `hourly`, `alphabetical`, `reversealphabetical`, `failedfirst`, or `balanced`.

Since you can't use `balanced` and renaming or moving test classes is not an option, you might want to consider using `failedfirst`. This option will run tests that failed during the previous run before other tests. This could potentially speed up your CI process by failing faster if a previously failed test is still failing.

Another option could be to split your tests into different profiles based on their execution time and run the profiles containing the slower tests first.

Here is an example of how to set the `runOrder` parameter in your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<build>
    <plugins>
        <plugin>
            <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
            <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
            <version>2.22.2</version>
            <configuration>
                <runOrder>failedfirst</runOrder>
            </configuration>
        </plugin>
    </plugins>
</build>
```

And here is an example of how to define profiles:

```xml
<profiles>
    <profile>
        <id>slow-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.22.2</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*SlowTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
    <profile>
        <id>fast-tests</id>
        <build>
            <plugins>
                <plugin>
                    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
                    <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
                    <version>2.22.2</version>
                    <configuration>
                        <includes>
                            <include>**/*FastTest.java</include>
                        </includes>
                    </configuration>
                </plugin>
            </plugins>
        </build>
    </profile>
</profiles>
```

You can then run the profiles in the order you want:

```bash
mvn verify -P slow-tests,fast-tests
```
