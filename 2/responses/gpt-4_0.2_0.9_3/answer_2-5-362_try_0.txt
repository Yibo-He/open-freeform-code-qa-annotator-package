The error you're seeing is because the Spring Cloud Config Client is on the classpath, and it's trying to connect to a Config Server. This is a new behavior in Spring Cloud 2020.0.2 (part of the changes in Spring Boot 2.4.x and Spring Cloud 2020.0.x).

Since you're not using a Config Server, you can remove the dependency on the Config Client from your `build.gradle` file. 

Replace this line:
```groovy
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-config')
```
with this:
```groovy
implementation('org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap')
```
The `spring-cloud-starter-bootstrap` dependency includes the parts of the old `spring-cloud-starter-config` that are not related to the Config Server.

If you still encounter the issue, you can disable the Config Data property source locator by setting the following property in your `application.properties` or `application.yml` file:

```properties
spring.cloud.config.enabled=false
```
or
```yaml
spring:
  cloud:
    config:
      enabled: false
```

This will tell Spring Cloud not to use the Config Server for configuration.
