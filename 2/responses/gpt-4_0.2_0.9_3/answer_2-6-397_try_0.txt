The behavior you're experiencing is likely due to the new Hot Reload feature in .NET 6 and Visual Studio 2022. This feature is designed to improve the development experience by automatically refreshing your application when changes are made to the code.

If you want to disable this feature, you can do so by following these steps:

1. Go to `Tools` > `Options` in Visual Studio.
2. Navigate to `Projects and Solutions` > `.NET Hot Reload`.
3. Uncheck the box that says `Enable .NET Hot Reload on file save`.
4. Click `OK` to save your changes.

This should prevent Visual Studio from automatically refreshing your application when you save changes to your code.

If you're still experiencing the issue after following these steps, it's possible that there's a bug or some other issue causing the behavior. In that case, you might want to consider reporting the issue to Microsoft through the Visual Studio feedback tool.
