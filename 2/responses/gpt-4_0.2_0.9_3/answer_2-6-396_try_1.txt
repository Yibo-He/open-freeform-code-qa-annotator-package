The error you're getting is because you're trying to create an index on a navigation property `Gender`. Indexes in Entity Framework Core are not supported on navigation properties, they can only be created on scalar properties.

You should create the index on `GenderId` instead of `Gender`. Here's how you can do it:

```csharp
protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
{
    modelBuilder.Entity<User>(user =>
    {
        user
        .HasOne(x => x.Gender)
        .WithMany(x => x.Users)
        .HasForeignKey(x => x.GenderId);

        user.HasIndex(x => x.GenderId);
    });
}
```

In this code, `HasIndex(x => x.GenderId)` creates an index on the `GenderId` column of the `User` table. This can help speed up queries that filter or sort by `GenderId`.
