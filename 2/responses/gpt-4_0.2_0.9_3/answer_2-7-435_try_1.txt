The error message you're seeing is because `mysql-client` package is not available in the default repositories of the PHP Docker image you're using. 

In Debian 10 (buster) and the latest versions of Ubuntu, the `mysql-client` package has been replaced with `default-mysql-client`. So, you should replace `mysql-client` with `default-mysql-client` in your Dockerfile.

Here's the corrected part of your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client \
```

This should solve the problem you're facing. 

Also, I noticed that you're trying to install `nodejs` and some other packages, but they are not listed in the `apt-get install` command in the Dockerfile you posted. If you need them, make sure to include them:

```Dockerfile
# Install dependencies
RUN curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | bash - && \
    apt-get update && apt-get install -y default-mysql-client nodejs build-essential vim git curl
```

Remember to clean up after installing the packages to reduce the size of the image:

```Dockerfile
# Clear cache
RUN apt-get clean && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
```
