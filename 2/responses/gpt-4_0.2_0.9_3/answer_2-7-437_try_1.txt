The error messages you're seeing are because Xdebug 3 has changed some of its configuration settings. Here are the new settings that replace the ones you're trying to use:

- `xdebug.remote_enable` has been replaced by `xdebug.mode=debug`
- `xdebug.remote_host` has been replaced by `xdebug.client_host`
- `xdebug.remote_mode` has been removed, and Xdebug 3 will choose the best mode based on the other settings
- `xdebug.remote_port` has been replaced by `xdebug.client_port`

You can set these in your `php.ini` file. If you don't see anything about Xdebug in your `php.ini` file, you can add the settings at the end. Here's an example of what you might add:

```
[xdebug]
xdebug.mode=debug
xdebug.client_host=127.0.0.1
xdebug.client_port=9003
```

The `xdebug.client_host` should be set to the IP address of the machine running your IDE, and `xdebug.client_port` should be set to the port your IDE is listening on for Xdebug connections. The default port for Xdebug 2 was 9000, but for Xdebug 3 it's 9003.

After you've made these changes, you'll need to restart your web server for the new settings to take effect.

If you're still having trouble, you can use Xdebug's wizard to help you with the installation and configuration. You can find it here: https://xdebug.org/wizard

You just need to paste the output of `phpinfo()` into the text box and it will give you tailored installation instructions.
