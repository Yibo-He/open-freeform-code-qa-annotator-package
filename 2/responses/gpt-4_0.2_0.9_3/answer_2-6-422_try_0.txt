The error message you're seeing suggests that the migration is trying to create a table that already exists in your database. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The migration history table in your database (usually called `__EFMigrationsHistory`) might be out of sync with the actual state of your database. This can happen if you manually modify the database after running migrations.

2. There might be a problem with the way your `DbContext` is configured. If you have multiple `DbContext` classes in your application, make sure you're using the correct one when running migrations.

3. The migration might be trying to create a table that was created by a different migration. This can happen if you have overlapping migrations that try to create the same table.

Here are a few things you can try to fix the problem:

- If you have manually modified the database after running migrations, try reverting those changes and run the migration again.

- If you have multiple `DbContext` classes, make sure you're using the correct one when running migrations. You can specify the `DbContext` to use with the `-Context` parameter when running the `Update-Database` command.

- If you have overlapping migrations, try deleting the migration that's causing the problem and create a new one. You can delete a migration by running the `Remove-Migration` command.

- If none of the above solutions work, you might need to manually update the migration history table in your database. This should be done as a last resort and only if you're sure about what you're doing, as it can potentially cause data loss. You can do this by manually adding a row to the `__EFMigrationsHistory` table with the name of the migration and the product version (which should match the version of Entity Framework Core you're using).
