You can use a loop to iterate over the arrays and create the Bet instances. Here's how you can do it:

```php
public function store(Request $request)
{
    $names = $request->input('tw_name');
    $prices = $request->input('tw_price');

    for ($i = 0; $i < count($names); $i++) {
        Bet::create([
            'name' => $names[$i],
            'price' => $prices[$i],
        ]);
    }

    // redirect or return response
}
```

This code assumes that the 'tw_name' and 'tw_price' arrays have the same length. It gets the arrays from the request, then loops over them. For each iteration, it creates a new Bet with the name and price from the current index of the arrays.

Please make sure that the 'name' and 'price' fields are fillable in your Bet model:

```php
protected $fillable = ['name', 'price'];
```

This is to prevent mass assignment exceptions.
