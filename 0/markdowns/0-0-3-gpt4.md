When ever i install any dependency in my react native project and when ever i use link command for e.g react-native link react-native-gesture-handler this causes me an error shown in the image [1].
It doesn't build the project shows the error gradlew.bat
The following code shows my package.json file
```

From the error message, it seems like the problem is with the Windows command line not being able to execute the `gradlew.bat` file. This issue is usually caused by one of the following reasons:

1. **Incorrect Path:** The path to your project or to the `gradlew.bat` file might be incorrect. Make sure that the path does not contain any spaces or special characters.

2. **Permission Issues:** The command line might not have the necessary permissions to execute the `gradlew.bat` file. You can try running the command line as an administrator and see if that solves the problem.

3. **Environment Variables:** The environment variables might not be set up correctly. Make sure that the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable is set to the path of your JDK installation.

4. **Gradle Version:** There might be a compatibility issue with the version of Gradle you are using. You can try updating Gradle to the latest version.

5. **React Native Link:** The `react-native link` command has been deprecated in React Native 0.60 and above. If you are using a version below 0.60, you can continue using it, but if you are using a version 0.60 and above, you should use `autolinking` feature provided by React Native.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try manually linking the library. Here are the steps to do it for `react-native-gesture-handler`:

1. Open `android/app/src/main/java/[...]/MainActivity.java`
2. Add `import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;` to the imports at the top of the file
3. Replace `return new MainReactPackage();` with the following code:

```java
@Override
protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
  return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
    @Override
    protected ReactRootView createRootView() {
     return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);
    }
  };
}
```

4. Open `android/app/build.gradle` file and add the following lines in `dependencies`:

```groovy
implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
```

5. Open `android/settings.gradle` file and add the following lines:

```groovy
include ':react-native-gesture-handler'
project(':react-native-gesture-handler').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android')
```

After doing these steps, try to build the project again.

The error message you're seeing is related to the Android Gradle build failing. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but in your case, it's likely related to the `react-native link` command.

The `react-native link` command is used to automatically link native dependencies in your project. However, from React Native 0.60 and above, auto-linking is supported so you don't need to use `react-native link`. But as I see, you are using React Native version 0.58.3 which doesn't support auto-linking.

Here are a few steps you can take to try and resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, the build files can get into a bad state causing issues. You can clean your project and rebuild it. Navigate to your android folder in your react native project and run the following commands:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
react-native run-android
```

2. **Manual Linking**: If the `react-native link` command is not working properly, you can try to link the library manually. Here are the general steps to do that for `react-native-gesture-handler`:

- Update `android/settings.gradle` to include the `react-native-gesture-handler` package:

```gradle
include ':react-native-gesture-handler'
project(':react-native-gesture-handler').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android')
```

- Update `android/app/build.gradle` to add `react-native-gesture-handler` as a dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
}
```

- Update `MainApplication.java` to use `react-native-gesture-handler`:

```java
import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerPackage;  // <-- add this import

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
    //...
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
            new RNGestureHandlerPackage()  // <-- add this line
      );
    }
}
```

After these changes, try to run your project again.

3. **Upgrade React Native**: As I mentioned earlier, React Native 0.60 and above support auto-linking. So, you might consider upgrading your React Native version to the latest one. But remember, upgrading might also require you to make other changes in your project to ensure compatibility.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about the error message you're seeing. The screenshot you mentioned was not attached, so I can't see the exact error message.

The error you're facing is related to the linking of the `react-native-gesture-handler` library. Since React Native 0.60, the library uses auto-linking so you don't need to use `react-native link` command anymore. 

However, you're using React Native version 0.58.3, which doesn't support auto-linking. 

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. Uninstall the library:
```
npm uninstall react-native-gesture-handler
```

2. Reinstall the library:
```
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
```

3. Link the library manually. Open `android/app/src/main/java/<your-package-name>/MainActivity.java` and make the following changes:

```java
package com.reactnavigation.example;

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
// Add the following import
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

  @Override
  protected String getMainComponentName() {
    return "Example";
  }

  // Add the following method to your main activity class
  @Override
  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
      @Override
      protected ReactRootView createRootView() {
       return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);
      }
    };
  }
}
```

4. Open `android/settings.gradle` and add the following lines:

```gradle
include ':react-native-gesture-handler'
project(':react-native-gesture-handler').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android')
```

5. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following line in the `dependencies` block:

```gradle
implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
```

6. Run `react-native run-android` to build your project.

If you're still facing the issue, it might be related to the Windows environment. Try running the command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and then run the `react-native link` command.
