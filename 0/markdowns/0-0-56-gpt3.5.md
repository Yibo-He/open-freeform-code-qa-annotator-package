I have a Vue-cli app that I'm trying to convert to vite. I am using Docker to run the server. I looked at a couple tutorials and got vite to run in development mode without errors. However, the browser can't access the port. That is, when I'm on my macbook's command line (outside of Docker) I can't `curl` it:
```
$ curl localhost:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

If I try localhost:8081 I get `Failed to connect`. In addition, if I run the webpack dev server it works normally so I know that my container's port is exposed.
Also, if I run curl in the same virtual machine that is running the vite server it works, so I know that vite is working.
Here are the details:
In package.json:
```
...
"dev": "vue-cli-service serve",
"vite": "vite",
...
```

The entire vite.config.ts file:
```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

The command that starts the container:
```
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app bash
```

The docker-compose.yml file:
```
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

The Dockerfile:
```
FROM node:16.10.0

RUN npm install -g npm@8.1.3
RUN npm install -g @vue/cli@4.5.15

RUN mkdir /srv/app && chown node:node /srv/app

USER node

WORKDIR /srv/app
```

The command that I run inside the docker container for vite:
```
npm run vite
```

The command that I run inside the docker container for vue-cli:
```
npm run dev
```

So, to summarize: my setup works when running the vue-cli dev server but doesn't work when using the vite dev server.

It seems like the issue might be related to the way Vite handles the server configuration. By default, Vite uses a development server that only listens to requests from the local machine. To allow external access, you need to configure the server to listen to all network interfaces.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option in the server configuration:

```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080,
        host: '0.0.0.0'
    }
})
```

The `host` option tells Vite to listen to all network interfaces, not just the local machine. With this configuration, you should be able to access the Vite server from outside the Docker container.

Note that exposing the Vite server to the public internet can be a security risk, so make sure to only use this configuration for development purposes.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue might be related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which will allow it to accept connections from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.

If that doesn't work, you can also try specifying the `--host` option when running the Vite server inside the Docker container:

```
npm run vite -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

This should have the same effect as setting the `host` option in the `vite.config.ts` file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It looks like the issue might be with the port configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file. You have set the server port to `8080`, but you are also publishing the container port as `8080` in your `docker-compose.yml` file. This could be causing a conflict.

Try changing the server port in your `vite.config.ts` file to a different port, such as `8081`:

```
server: {
  port: 8081
}
```

Then, update your `docker-compose.yml` file to publish port `8081` instead:

```
ports:
  - "8081:8081"
```

After making these changes, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. Then try accessing `localhost:8081` in your browser or using `curl` to see if the issue is resolved.
