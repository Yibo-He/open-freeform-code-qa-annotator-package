I'm currently working on a signup form and the following is a snippet of my code:

```
const Signup = () => {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
    const [passwordConfirmation, setPasswordConfirmation] = useState('')

    const clearState = () => {
        setUsername('')
        setEmail('')
        setPassword('')
        setPasswordConfirmation('')
    }

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            clearState() // <-----------
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```


Each piece of state is used for a controlled input for the form.

Essentially what I want to do is after the user has successfully signed up, I want the state to go back to the initial state with the fields cleared.

It's quite imperative to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings in`clearState` I was wondering if there is a method or function that comes with React that resets the state back to its initial values?

React doesn't provide a built-in method to reset all state variables to their initial values. However, you can create a custom hook that does this. Here's an example:

```jsx
const useForm = (initialState) => {
    const [values, setValues] = useState(initialState);

    const handleChange = (event) => {
        setValues({
            ...values,
            [event.target.name]: event.target.value
        });
    };

    const resetForm = () => {
        setValues(initialState);
    };

    return [values, handleChange, resetForm];
};

// Usage
const Signup = () => {
    const [values, handleChange, resetForm] = useForm({
        username: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        passwordConfirmation: ''
    });

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data);
            resetForm();
        });
    };

    return <JSX />
};

export default Signup;
```

In this example, `useForm` is a custom hook that takes an initial state object and returns the current state, a handler function to update the state, and a function to reset the state to its initial values. 

You can use the `handleChange` function in your form inputs to update the state, and `resetForm` to reset the state after the user has signed up.

React does not provide a built-in method to reset all state variables back to their initial values. The way you're doing it right now is actually a common approach in React. 

However, if you want to make your code cleaner and more maintainable, you could consider using useReducer instead of useState. useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. 

Here's an example of how you might use useReducer to handle your form state:

```jsx
const initialState = {
    username: '',
    email: '',
    password: '',
    passwordConfirmation: ''
}

function reducer(state, action) {
    switch (action.type) {
        case 'field': // action to handle field changes
            return {
                ...state,
                [action.fieldName]: action.payload,
            }
        case 'reset': // action to reset the state
            return initialState
        default:
            return state
    }
}

const Signup = () => {
    const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState)
    const { username, email, password, passwordConfirmation } = state

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            dispatch({ type: 'reset' }) // reset the state
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```

In this example, you would use dispatch to update the state fields like this:

```jsx
onChange={e => dispatch({ type: 'field', fieldName: 'username', payload: e.target.value })}
```

This way, you can easily reset all fields by dispatching a 'reset' action.

React does not provide a built-in method to reset all state variables to their initial values. However, you can create a custom hook that does this. Here's an example:

```jsx
function useForm(initialState) {
    const [values, setValues] = useState(initialState);

    const handleChange = e => {
        setValues({
            ...values,
            [e.target.name]: e.target.value
        });
    };

    const resetForm = () => {
        setValues(initialState);
    };

    return [values, handleChange, resetForm];
}

// Usage
const Signup = () => {
    const initialState = {
        username: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        passwordConfirmation: ''
    };
    const [values, handleChange, resetForm] = useForm(initialState);

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault();
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data);
            resetForm();
        });
    };

    return <JSX />;
};

export default Signup;
```

In this example, `useForm` is a custom hook that takes an initial state object and returns the current state, a function to update the state, and a function to reset the state to its initial values. This way, you can manage all your form fields with a single state object and reset them all at once.
