so I have a react app which is deployed on IIS, I'm using react router and my routes and the order of them are OK, everything works fine locally in development mode,
my routes.js file returns routes like this :
```
<Router history={history}>
    <Switch>
      {/* there are some other routes that are removed from here */}
      {/* token is the jwt token for user */}
      {!token && <Route path="/Home" component={HomePage} />}

      <Route path="/" exact>
        {!!token ? <Redirect to="/Dashboard" /> : <Redirect to="/Home" />}
      </Route>
      <Route path="*" exact component={FourOFour} />
    </Switch>
  </Router>
```

I have a jsx file for my "not-found page", which returns the component ,
as I said everything including the not-found page shows completely fine in the development mode on my machine. but when I deploy my react app on IIS, my custom not-found page won't show, instead the default 404 page of the IIS is shown, how do I make the ISS stop messing with my routes?
PS: I know it's the servers job to handle the errors such as 404 and it's a default behavior, and I also have tried some suggestions I've found on the web but some of them was ruining everything and some was not clear that what was happening,
so I was hoping to get a clear explanation of the steps for configs of IIS,
any suggestion is appreciated

## Update



first I handled error 404 in my router in client-side, it was not working because iis has default html pages for common errors such as 404, 500, ... and it kinda catches the errors before the request even reaches the client side, so I figured out it's an issue handled by the server not the client side, then I tried different configs in iis, because iis has an "Error Pages" section for each site and in this section you can change the way it treats such errors, for each type of error (actually each status code) it has three options:

1. insert content from static file into the error response


which you can give a path to a static html page and it will show up, but as I said above, my not-found page is written in a jsx file, and it has a looooot of java-script code in it, it's not impossible to put everything in a html page and use this way but it would get my code dirty and I prefer a way that is not getting my code messy, plus I tried this way just to see if it works but it show this error:
"The resource you are looking for has been removed, had its name changed, or is temporarily unavailable."

1. execute a url in this site


it could be the best solution for me and I could set a "/404" path in my routes that redirects to my not-found page, and everything would look nice and clean, but sadly it didn't work, looks like iis was not redirect to my specific url and instead shows a white screen, which is worse than it's default 404 page...

1. response with a 302 redirect


which is not the solution for me because I don't want to redirect to a page outside of my app
I also read [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/36623117/10220474) very carefully but still have no clue what to do

The issue you're experiencing is due to the way IIS handles routing. By default, IIS doesn't know how to handle client-side routing, so when a route doesn't match any server-side routes, it returns a 404 error.

To solve this issue, you need to configure IIS to redirect all requests to your React app, letting React Router handle the routing. Here are the steps to do this:

1. Install the URL Rewrite module in IIS. You can download it from the official Microsoft website.

2. Once installed, open IIS Manager and select your website.

3. In the Features View, double-click on URL Rewrite.

4. In the Actions pane, click on "Add Rule(s)...".

5. In the Add Rules dialog, under Inbound rules, select "Blank rule" and click OK.

6. In the Edit Inbound Rule dialog, give your rule a name (e.g., "React Routing").

7. Under Match URL, set the following:
   - Requested URL: Matches the Pattern
   - Using: Regular Expressions
   - Pattern: `.*`

8. Under Action, set the following:
   - Action type: Rewrite
   - Rewrite URL: `/index.html`
   - Append query string: Checked

9. Click Apply in the Actions pane.

This rule tells IIS to redirect all requests to your `index.html` file, which is the entry point of your React app. This way, React Router can handle all the routing.

Remember to build your React app for production (`npm run build`) and deploy the built files to IIS.

Also, ensure that the web.config file generated by the build process is present in the root directory of your website in IIS. This file contains necessary configuration for IIS to properly serve your React app.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to adjust your React Router configuration. For example, you might need to use `BrowserRouter` instead of `Router`, or you might need to provide a `basename` prop to `BrowserRouter` if your app is served from a subdirectory.

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that IIS is a server and it handles the routing before your React app does. When you try to access a route that doesn't exist, IIS doesn't know about your React Router and returns its default 404 page.

To solve this issue, you need to configure IIS to redirect all requests to your React app, and let React Router handle the routing. This can be achieved by installing and configuring the URL Rewrite module for IIS.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the URL Rewrite module. You can download it from the official Microsoft website.

2. Once installed, open IIS Manager and navigate to your website.

3. In the Features View, double click on "URL Rewrite".

4. In the Actions pane on the right, click on "Add Rule(s)".

5. In the Add Rules dialog, under Inbound rules, select "Blank rule" and click OK.

6. In the Edit Inbound Rule dialog, give your rule a name (e.g., "React Router").

7. Under Match URL, set the following:
   - Requested URL: Matches the Pattern
   - Using: Regular Expressions
   - Pattern: .*

8. Under Action, set the following:
   - Action type: Rewrite
   - Rewrite URL: / (just a forward slash)

9. Under Conditions, click "Add" and set the following:
   - Condition input: {REQUEST_FILENAME}
   - Check if input string: Is Not a File
   - Click OK to add the condition.
   - Click "Add" again and set the following:
   - Condition input: {REQUEST_FILENAME}
   - Check if input string: Is Not a Directory
   - Click OK to add the condition.

10. Click "Apply" in the Actions pane on the right to save the rule.

This rule will redirect all requests to your React app unless the requested URL corresponds to a file or a directory. This way, IIS will serve your static files (like your JavaScript, CSS, and image files), but all other requests will be handled by your React Router.

Remember to restart IIS after applying these changes. You can do this by running `iisreset` in the command prompt.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that IIS handles routing before your React application does. When a URL is requested that doesn't map to a physical file, IIS returns a 404 error before your React application has a chance to handle the route.

To fix this, you need to install the URL Rewrite module in IIS and then add a rewrite rule to your web.config file. This will tell IIS to redirect all requests to your root document (usually index.html), allowing your React application to handle the routing.

Here are the steps:

1. Install the URL Rewrite module. You can download it from the official Microsoft website. After downloading, just run the installer.

2. Once installed, open your web.config file. If you don't have one, create it in the root directory of your application.

3. Add the following configuration to your web.config file:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="React Routes" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url=".*" />
          <conditions logicalGrouping="MatchAll">
            <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
            <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsDirectory" negate="true" />
          </conditions>
          <action type="Rewrite" url="/" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
    </rewrite>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This configuration tells IIS to redirect all requests to your root document unless the request is for a file or directory that actually exists. This allows your React application to handle all the routing.

4. Save your web.config file and restart IIS.

Now, when you navigate to a route in your application, IIS will serve your root document and your React application will handle the route, displaying your custom 404 page when appropriate.
