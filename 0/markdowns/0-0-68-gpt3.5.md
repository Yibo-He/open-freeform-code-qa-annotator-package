I am trying to spy on useState React hook but i always get the test failed
This is my React component:
```
const Counter= () => {
    const[counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

    const handleClick=() => {
        setCounter(counter + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{counter}</h2>
            <button onClick={handleClick} id="button">increment</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

:
```
it('increment counter correctlry', () => {
    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);
     const button = wrapper.find("button")
     button.simulate('click');
     expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work and i get the test failed with that message:
```
expected 1
Number of calls: 0
```

It looks like the issue is with the way you are using `setState` in your test. Instead of passing `1` as an argument to `setState`, you should be passing `counter + 1`. Here's the updated test code:

```
it('increments counter correctly', () => {
  let wrapper = shallow(<Counter />);
  const setState = jest.fn();
  const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

  useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);
  const button = wrapper.find("button");
  button.simulate('click');
  expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
});
```

Also, make sure that you have imported `React` at the top of your test file:

```
import React from 'react';
```

It looks like the issue is with the way you are spying on the useState hook. Instead of spying on the React module, you should spy on the module where the useState hook is defined, which is the 'react' module. Here's an updated test that should work:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { shallow } from 'enzyme';

const Counter= () => {
    const[counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

    const handleClick=() => {
        setCounter(counter + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{counter}</h2>
            <button onClick={handleClick} id="button">increment</button>
        </div>
    )
}

it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');
    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);

    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);
    const button = wrapper.find("button")
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

In this updated test, we are spying on the 'useState' function in the 'react' module and providing a mock implementation that returns an array with the initial state and the setState function. Then, we are rendering the Counter component and simulating a click on the button, which should trigger the setState function with the expected value. Finally, we are asserting that the setState function was called with the expected value.

It looks like the issue might be with the way you are trying to spy on the useState hook. Instead of spying on the React module, you should spy on the module where the useState hook is defined. Here's an updated test that should work:

```
import { useState } from 'react';

it('increments counter correctly', () => {
  const setState = jest.fn();
  jest.spyOn(React, 'useState').mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);

  const wrapper = shallow(<Counter />);
  const button = wrapper.find('#button');
  button.simulate('click');

  expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
});
```

In this updated test, we are importing the useState hook from the 'react' module and spying on it using jest.spyOn. We then mock the implementation of the useState hook to return the initial state and the setState function that we can spy on. Finally, we simulate a click on the button and expect that the setState function was called with the expected value.
