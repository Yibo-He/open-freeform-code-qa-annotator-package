Trying to install [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) into [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app), but get next error when running linter:

![enter image description here]](https://i.stack.imgur.com/YhtHl.png)

Here is my `.eslintrc` config file:

```
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "parser": "babel-eslint"
}
```


If install `babel-eslint` manually it'll potentially produce another error based on package conflict between  project and `react-scripts` dependencies:

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It looks like you are running into a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One solution is to install `eslint-config-react-app` which is specifically designed to work with `create-react-app`. 

Here are the steps to install and configure `eslint` with `create-react-app`:

1. Install `eslint-config-react-app` as a dev dependency:

   ```
   npm install eslint-config-react-app --save-dev
   ```

2. Update your `.eslintrc` file to extend `eslint-config-react-app`:

   ```
   {
     "extends": "react-app"
   }
   ```

   This will automatically include the necessary plugins and configurations for `eslint` to work with `create-react-app`.

3. Run `eslint` again and see if the error is resolved:

   ```
   eslint src
   ```

   This should run `eslint` on your `src` directory and show any linting errors or warnings.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It looks like you are facing a dependency conflict issue between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One possible solution is to update the `eslint` version to a compatible one with `react-scripts`. You can try running the following command to install a compatible version of `eslint`:

```
npm install eslint@6.8.0 --save-dev
```

Then, update your `.eslintrc` file to use the installed version of `eslint`:

```
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es6": true
  }
}
```

If this doesn't work, you can try removing the `babel-eslint` package and using the default parser that comes with `eslint`. To do this, remove `"parser": "babel-eslint"` from your `.eslintrc` file and run the following command to uninstall `babel-eslint`:

```
npm uninstall babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Then, run the linter again and see if it works.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It looks like you are running into a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One solution is to install `eslint-config-react-app` which is specifically designed to work with `create-react-app` and includes all the necessary dependencies.

Here are the steps to install `eslint-config-react-app`:

1. Remove `eslint` and `babel-eslint` from your project by running the following command:

   ```
   npm uninstall eslint babel-eslint
   ```

2. Install `eslint-config-react-app` by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install eslint-config-react-app --save-dev
   ```

3. Update your `.eslintrc` file to extend `eslint-config-react-app`:

   ```
   {
     "extends": "react-app"
   }
   ```

4. Run your linter again and it should work without any conflicts.

Let me know if this helps!
