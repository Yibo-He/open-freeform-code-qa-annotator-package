I'm trying to update Angular in my project from version 10.2 to 11.0.
Running ng update:
```
@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1002.0 -> 0.1100.1     ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular
  @angular/cdk                       10.2.7 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/cdk
  @angular/cli                       10.2.0 -> 11.0.1         ng update @angular/cli
  @angular/core                      10.2.3 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/core
  @angular/material                  10.2.7 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/material
```

Unfortunately each package I tried to update fails. I tried with --force and --allowDirty flags.

It seems like you're having issues with conflicting dependencies. Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. First, make sure you have the latest version of Node.js and npm installed. You can check your version by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in your terminal. If you don't have the latest version, you can download it from the official Node.js website.

2. Next, you should try to clean your npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force`.

3. Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file. These files will be regenerated in the next steps.

4. Run `npm install -g @angular/cli@11.0.1` to globally install the specific version of Angular CLI.

5. Now, go to your project directory and run `npm install`. This will install all the dependencies defined in your `package.json` file.

6. After that, run `ng update @angular/core@11 @angular/cli@11`. This command will update your Angular core and CLI to version 11.

7. Finally, run `ng update @angular/material@11` and `ng update @angular/cdk@11` to update Angular Material and CDK to version 11.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider creating a new Angular 11 project and moving your source files to the new project. This can be a more reliable way to upgrade if your project has complex dependencies.

The error messages indicate that there are conflicting dependencies in your project. This can happen when you try to update packages that depend on each other in a specific order. 

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. First, update your global Angular CLI to the latest version by running the following command:

```bash
npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
npm cache verify
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

2. Then, navigate to your project directory and remove the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file. You can do this manually or by running the following commands:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
```

3. After that, update your local project's Angular CLI and Core by running the following command:

```bash
ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
```

4. Then, update the rest of the Angular packages:

```bash
ng update @angular/cdk @angular/material
```

5. Finally, reinstall your `node_modules` by running `npm install`.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to consider creating a new Angular 11 project and moving your source files to the new project. This can be a more reliable way to update Angular, especially for major version changes.

The error messages you're seeing are due to conflicting dependencies in your project. The Angular CLI is trying to update `@angular-devkit/build-angular` to version `0.1100.1`, but this version requires `@angular/compiler-cli` version `11.0.0` or later. However, your project currently has a different version of `@angular/compiler-cli` installed, hence the conflict.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to resolve this issue:

1. First, update your global Angular CLI to version 11.0.1 by running the following command:

   ```
   npm uninstall -g @angular/cli
   npm cache verify
   npm install -g @angular/cli@11.0.1
   ```

2. Then, navigate to your project directory and update the local Angular CLI:

   ```
   ng update @angular/cli@11.0.1
   ```

3. Next, update `@angular/core`:

   ```
   ng update @angular/core@11.0.0
   ```

4. After that, update `@angular-devkit/build-angular`:

   ```
   ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
   ```

5. Now, update `@angular/cdk` and `@angular/material`:

   ```
   ng update @angular/cdk@11.0.0
   ng update @angular/material@11.0.0
   ```

6. Finally, run `npm install` to install any remaining dependencies.

If you still encounter issues, try deleting your `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again. This will force npm to resolve and fetch the latest versions of all dependencies.

Remember to backup your project before making these changes, just in case something goes wrong.
