## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can use the `:first-of-type` selector to select the first element of the four elements. Here's an example code snippet:

```
const firstElement = cy.get('[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:first-of-type');
```

This will select the first `span` element within the `offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer` element.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the `:first-of-type` selector to select the first element of a certain type within its parent element. In this case, you can modify your locator to select the first `span` element within the first `div` element that matches the `data-cy` attribute value:

```
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] > div:first-of-type > span:first-of-type
```

This should select the "Joined" heading element that you are looking for.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `:first-of-type` selector to select the first element of a certain type within its parent element. In this case, you can modify your locator to select the first `span` element within the parent element, like this:

```
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:first-of-type
```

This should select only the first `span` element within the parent element, which should be the "Joined" heading you are looking for.
