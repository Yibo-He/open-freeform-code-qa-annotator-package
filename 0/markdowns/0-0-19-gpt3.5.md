I have a Node.js application. When I try to run `npm install` it hangs with this:

```
loadIdealTree:loadAllDepsIntoIdealTree: sill install loadIdealTree
```


`npm install --verbose` gives me a little extra info:

I came across instances where other people experienced this but the below seemed to resolve their issue. It doesn't fix mine:

```
npm set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
```


Does anybody know what might be wrong?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like the package `aws-sdk-js` is not available in the npm registry or the version you are trying to install is not available. This is indicated by the `404 Not Found` error message in the log.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package `aws-sdk-js` exists in the npm registry by visiting the following link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-js. If it does not exist, then you will need to find an alternative package or contact the package author.

2. If the package exists, try installing a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>` instead of `npm install aws-sdk-js`. You can find the available versions of the package on the npm registry page.

3. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. Try using a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and then running `npm install` again.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable.
2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.
3. Try installing a different package to see if the issue is specific to `aws-sdk-js`. For example, you can try running `npm install express`.
4. If the issue persists, you can try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`. This will set the registry to the default npm registry.

If none of these steps work, you can try reaching out to the npm support team for further assistance.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Based on the error message, it seems that `npm` is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the registry. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package has been removed from the registry.
2. There is an issue with the registry itself.
3. There is a problem with your internet connection.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package exists in the registry by visiting the following URL: https://registry.npmjs.org/aws-sdk-js. If the package is not found, it may have been removed.
2. Try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.
3. Check your internet connection to make sure it is working properly.
4. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then running `npm install` again.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to reach out to the package maintainer or the npm support team for further assistance.
