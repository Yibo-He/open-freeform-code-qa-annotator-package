Re-posting a similar question to my last because of a new issue. I'm trying to use context with hooks to manage authentication in my react app. I'm getting the error `TypeError: Cannot destructure property 'isAuthenticated' of 'Object(...)(...)' as it is undefined.`, yet when I `console.log` the property where it's defined, I see `false` not `undefined`.

I have the context definition and provider in `authContext.js`

```
import React, { useState, useEffect, createContext } from "react";
import axios from "axios";

const AuthContext = createContext();
export { AuthContext };

const AuthContextProvider = (props) => {
  const [isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated] = useState(false);

  const setAuth = (boolean) => {
    setIsAuthenticated(boolean);
  };

  const apiOptions = {
    url: "users/is-verified",
    method: "GET",
    headers: {
      token: localStorage.token,
    },
  };

  function isAuth() {
    axios(apiOptions)
      .then((response) => {
        console.log("auth ran");
        const resData = response.data;
        resData === true ? setIsAuthenticated(true) : setIsAuthenticated(false);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log(error.response);
      });
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    isAuth();
  }, []);
  console.log(isAuthenticated);
  return (
    <AuthContext.Provider
      value={{ isAuthenticated, setIsAuthenticated, setAuth }}
    >
      {props.children}
    </AuthContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default AuthContextProvider;
```


Then I have my routes wrapped in the provider in `app.js`

```
import React from "react";
import {
  Switch,
  Route,
} from "react-router-dom";
import "./App.css";
import Register from "./components/pages/register";
import AuthContextProvider from "./components/context/authContext";
import RegisterRoutes from "./components/routing/registerRoutes";

function App() {

  return (
    <AuthContextProvider>
      <div className="App h-100 ">
        <Switch>
          <Route
            exact
            path="/register"
            render={(props) => (
              <RegisterRoutes {...props} />
            )}
          />
        </Switch>
      </div>
    </AuthContextProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```


Then I have a `RegisterRoutes` component that returns one of two pages based on the `isAuthenticated` value

```
import React, { useContext } from "react";
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
import { Redirect } from "react-router-dom";
import Register from "../pages/register";

function RegisterRoutes(props) {
  const { isAuthenticated, setAuth } = useContext(AuthContext);
  console.log(isAuthenticated);

  return !isAuthenticated ? (
    <Register {...props} setAuth={setAuth} />
  ) : (
    <Redirect to="/login" />
  );
}

export default RegisterRoutes;
```

The issue you're facing is likely due to the way you're exporting and importing `AuthContext`. In your `authContext.js` file, you're exporting `AuthContext` as a named export:

```javascript
export { AuthContext };
```

However, in your `RegisterRoutes` component, you're trying to import it as a default export:

```javascript
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
```

This is why `AuthContext` is `undefined` in `RegisterRoutes`. To fix this, you should import `AuthContext` as a named import:

```javascript
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

Alternatively, you can change the export in `authContext.js` to be a default export:

```javascript
export default AuthContext;
```

Then you can keep your import in `RegisterRoutes` as it is. 

Also, make sure that you're exporting `AuthContextProvider` correctly in `authContext.js`. If you're using a default export, your import in `App.js` is correct. If you're using a named export, you'll need to adjust your import in `App.js` to match.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue is with the way you're importing `AuthContext` in your `RegisterRoutes` component. You're trying to import it as a default export, but it's not being exported as default from `authContext.js`. 

In your `authContext.js`, you're exporting `AuthContext` as a named export:

```jsx
export { AuthContext };
```

And `AuthContextProvider` as a default export:

```jsx
export default AuthContextProvider;
```

So, in your `RegisterRoutes` component, you should import `AuthContext` like this:

```jsx
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

This should resolve the issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue seems to be with how you're importing the `AuthContext` in your `RegisterRoutes` component. You're trying to import it as a default export, but it's not being exported as default from `authContext.js`.

In `authContext.js`, you're exporting `AuthContext` as a named export:

```javascript
export { AuthContext };
```

So, in `RegisterRoutes.js`, you should import it like this:

```javascript
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

Instead of:

```javascript
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
```

This should solve the issue of `isAuthenticated` being `undefined`.
