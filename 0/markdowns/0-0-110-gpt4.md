I have a simple component that acts as an error boundary in my React app, and which passes off any errors to a logging service.

It looks something like this:

```
export class CatchError extends React.PureComponent {
  state = {
    hasError: false
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    this.props.log({ error, info })
    this.setState({ hasError: true })
  }

  render() {
    const child = typeof this.props.children === "function"
      ? this.props.children({ error: hasError })
      : children

    return React.cloneElement(child, { error: this.state.hasError })
  }
}
```


Is there a React hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch` so I can make this component a function and not a class?

So it might look something like this:

```
export function CatchError({ children, log }) {
  const [hasError, setHasError] = useState(false)
  const caught = useDidCatch()

  useEffect(() => {
    const [error, info] = caught
    log({ error, info })
    setHasError(true)
  }, [caught])

  const child = typeof children === "function"
    ? children({ error: hasError })
    : children

  return React.cloneElement(child, { error: hasError })
}
```

Unfortunately, as of now, React does not provide a hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch`. Error boundaries, as of the current version of React (17.x), can only be class components.

React team has mentioned that they are considering adding this feature in the future, but for now, you will have to use class components to catch errors in the component tree.

Here's a link to the official React documentation on error boundaries: https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html

So, for now, you will have to stick with your class component for error handling.

As of the current version of React (17.0.2), there is no hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch` or `getDerivedStateFromError`. Error boundaries must be class components.

The React team has mentioned that they are considering adding this feature in the future, but as of now, there is no way to catch errors in a function component.

So, for now, you have to use class components to catch errors. Here is an example of how you can do it:

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```

You can use it as a regular component to wrap any part of your application:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

In this example, if `MyComponent` throws an error during rendering, the `ErrorBoundary` will catch it, log it to your service, and render a fallback UI.

You can follow this issue on the official React GitHub repository for updates: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11334

So, for now, you'll have to stick with class components for error boundaries.
