While running
```
npm run dev
```

I suddenly start getting error without pretty much any change to the code of the project:
```

Modifying the code of the app so it won't include any files or load anything still produces the same error.

This error is typically caused by a mismatch in dependencies or a corrupted node_modules folder. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:** Sometimes, the node_modules folder or the package-lock.json file can become corrupted. Delete both the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file from your project directory.

2. **Clear npm cache:** Run the following command to clear the npm cache:

    ```
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run the following command to reinstall your project dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. **Update next.js:** If the error persists, it might be due to a bug in the version of next.js you are using. You can update next.js by running:

    ```
    npm install next@latest
    ```

5. **Check your code:** If the error still persists, check your code to ensure that you are not trying to extend an undefined class. The error message suggests that somewhere in your code, a class is trying to extend something that is undefined.

If none of the above steps work, please provide more details about your project setup, including the versions of Node.js and npm you are using, as well as the contents of your package.json file.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `postcss-scss` package, which is a part of the `next` package in your project. It seems like a class is trying to extend from something that is either `undefined` or `null`.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Clear Node Modules and Reinstall**: Sometimes, the node_modules folder or the package-lock.json file can get corrupted. Delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` to reinstall your packages.

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

2. **Update Next.js and PostCSS**: The issue might be due to a specific version of Next.js or PostCSS. Try updating these packages to their latest versions.

```bash
npm install next@latest
npm install postcss@latest
```

3. **Check Your PostCSS Configuration**: If you have a PostCSS configuration file in your project (usually `postcss.config.js`), check to make sure it's correctly configured. If you're not sure, refer to the [Next.js documentation on PostCSS](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/customizing-postcss-config) for guidance.

4. **Check Your Code**: Even though you mentioned that modifying the code to not include any files or load anything still produces the same error, it's worth double-checking. The error message suggests that a class is trying to extend from something that is either `undefined` or `null`. Make sure that all classes are extending from valid constructors.

If none of these steps resolve your issue, it might be a bug in the `next` or `postcss-scss` package. In this case, you might want to create an issue in the relevant GitHub repository to get help from the package maintainers.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `postcss-scss` package in your `node_modules` directory. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as a corrupted package, an incompatible version, or a problem with your `node_modules` directory itself.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` then reinstall dependencies**

Sometimes, the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file can get corrupted, causing issues like this. You can try deleting both and then reinstalling your dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

2. **Check your package versions**

Make sure that the versions of your packages are compatible with each other. In particular, check the version of `postcss-scss` and `next.js` you're using. You might need to upgrade or downgrade one or both of these packages to get them to work together.

3. **Check your Node.js version**

Ensure that you're using a version of Node.js that's compatible with your packages. You can check your Node.js version with `node -v`. If you're using an older version, you might need to upgrade.

4. **Check your code**

The error message suggests that a class is extending an undefined value. This could be due to an issue in your code. Even though you mentioned that modifying the code so it won't include any files or load anything still produces the same error, it's worth double-checking to make sure there's not a problem with the code itself.

If none of these steps work, please provide more details about your project setup, including the versions of `next.js`, `postcss-scss`, and Node.js you're using, and any other relevant information. This will help in diagnosing the problem.
