I suspect the issue is with the line `const active = document.querySelector(".accordion.active");` in JS code below. It doesn't seem to be retrieving that element. Could you please help me debug it? Or should I use something else instead of `querySelector`? It is also found that `this.classList.add("active");` is not adding the "active class" to the accordion element when it is clicked.
```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
      const active = document.querySelector(".accordion.active");
      console.log(active);
      if (active) {
        active.classList.remove('active'); // remove active class from accordions
      }
      this.classList.add("active"); // add it to this one
      
      this.classList.toggle("active");
      var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
      if (panel.style.display === "block") {
        panel.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        panel.style.display = "block";
      }
    });
  }
});
```
```
.accordion {
  background-color: #eee;
  color: #444;
  cursor: pointer;
  padding: 1.5rem;
  width: 100%;
  border: none;
  text-align: left;
  outline: none;
  font-size: 15px;
  transition: 0.4s;
}

.active,
.accordion:hover {
  background-color: #ccc;
}

.panel {
  padding: 0 18px;
  display: none;
  background-color: white;
  overflow: hidden;
  background: red;
}

.active+.panel {
  display: block;
}
```
```
<div class="row">
  <button class="accordion"><div class="question"><?php echo $label; ?></div></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p class="answer">
      <?php echo $answer; ?>
    </p>
    </br>
  </div>
</div>
<div class="row">
  <button class="accordion"><div class="question"><?php echo $label; ?></div></button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p class="answer">
      <?php echo $answer; ?>
    </p>
    </br>
  </div>
</div>
```

The issue seems to be that you are adding the "active" class and then immediately toggling it off again. The line `this.classList.add("active");` adds the "active" class, but then `this.classList.toggle("active");` immediately removes it if it's present, which it is, because you just added it.

Here's the corrected JavaScript:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
      const active = document.querySelector(".accordion.active");
      console.log(active);
      if (active) {
        active.classList.remove('active'); // remove active class from accordions
      }
      this.classList.add("active"); // add it to this one
      
      var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
      if (panel.style.display === "block") {
        panel.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        panel.style.display = "block";
      }
    });
  }
});
```

I've removed the line `this.classList.toggle("active");` because it's not needed. The "active" class is added to the clicked element, and if there's another element with the "active" class, it's removed from that element. This should ensure that only one accordion can be active at a time.

Also, please make sure that the element with the "accordion" class is actually getting the "active" class. If it's not, the `querySelector` won't be able to find it. You can check this by inspecting the element in your browser's developer tools.

The issue seems to be that you're adding the "active" class and then immediately toggling it off again. This is why `document.querySelector(".accordion.active");` is not finding any element, because the "active" class is being removed right after it's added. 

Here's the corrected JavaScript code:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
      const active = document.querySelector(".accordion.active");
      console.log(active);
      if (active) {
        active.classList.remove('active'); // remove active class from accordions
      }
      this.classList.add("active"); // add it to this one
      
      var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
      if (panel.style.display === "block") {
        panel.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        panel.style.display = "block";
      }
    });
  }
});
```

I removed the line `this.classList.toggle("active");` because it was toggling off the "active" class right after it was added. Now, when you click on an accordion, it should add the "active" class to it, and if there was another accordion that was active, it should remove the "active" class from it.

The issue seems to be that you're adding the "active" class and then immediately toggling it. This means that if the element didn't have the "active" class before, it will be added and then immediately removed. If it did have the "active" class, it will be added again (which doesn't change anything), and then removed. 

Here's how you can fix it:

```javascript
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
      const active = document.querySelector(".accordion.active");
      console.log(active);
      if (active) {
        active.classList.remove('active'); // remove active class from accordions
      }
      this.classList.add("active"); // add it to this one
      
      var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
      if (panel.style.display === "block") {
        panel.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        panel.style.display = "block";
      }
    });
  }
});
```

In this code, I've removed the line `this.classList.toggle("active");` because it's unnecessary and was causing the issue. Now, when you click on an accordion, the "active" class will be removed from any other accordions that have it, and then added to the one you clicked on. The panel associated with the accordion will then be shown or hidden depending on its current state.
