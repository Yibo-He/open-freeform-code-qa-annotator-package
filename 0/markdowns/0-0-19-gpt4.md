I have a Node.js application. When I try to run `npm install` it hangs with this:

```
loadIdealTree:loadAllDepsIntoIdealTree: sill install loadIdealTree
```


`npm install --verbose` gives me a little extra info:

I came across instances where other people experienced this but the below seemed to resolve their issue. It doesn't fix mine:

```
npm set registry http://registry.npmjs.org/
```


Does anybody know what might be wrong?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry. 

The correct package name for the AWS SDK for JavaScript in Node.js is `aws-sdk`. 

You should be able to install it using the following command:

```bash
npm install aws-sdk
```

Please try this and let me know if you still encounter any issues.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message `npm http fetch GET 404 https://registry.npmjs.org/aws-sdk-js 2211ms` suggests that npm is trying to fetch the package `aws-sdk-js` from the npm registry but it's not found, hence the 404 error.

The correct package name for the AWS SDK in the npm registry is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You should replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in the npm install command. 

So, the correct command should be:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

And if you're adding it to your `package.json` file, it should look something like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "aws-sdk": "^2.789.0"
}
```

Remember to replace `^2.789.0` with the version you want to use.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that the package `aws-sdk-js` cannot be found in the npm registry. This is because there is no package with that exact name in the npm registry.

If you're trying to install the AWS SDK for JavaScript, the correct package name is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install aws-sdk
```

This should resolve your issue.
