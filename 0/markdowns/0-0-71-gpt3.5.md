I have custom type in `src/@types/app.d.ts` ( `export type AuthKeyT = string` )

I would like to use it in `tsx` react file (using `import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app'`), but I am getting an error:

> Cannot import type declaration files. Consider importing 'app' instead of '@types/app' 

So, when I use `import { AuthKeyT } from 'app'` I am getting:

> Cannot find module 'app'.

So.. what is wrong? How should I import custom type?

I am using typescript `3.7.2` in react app.

The error message you are seeing is because TypeScript does not allow importing type declarations directly. Instead, you should import the module that exports the type declaration.

In your case, you should export the `AuthKeyT` type from a module in your project, and then import it in your React component like this:

```
// src/types/app.ts
export type AuthKeyT = string;

// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../types/app';

// use AuthKeyT in your component
```

Make sure that the path to the `app.ts` file is correct relative to the file that is importing it.

Also, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file has the `"baseUrl": "./src"` and `"paths"` set up correctly to allow for importing modules using the `@` symbol. For example:

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@types/*": ["./@types/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, you should be able to import your custom type like this:

```
import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app';
```

The error message you are seeing is because TypeScript does not allow importing type declarations directly. Instead, you should import the module that exports the type declaration.

In your case, it seems that you have defined the type declaration in a file located at `src/@types/app.d.ts`. This file is not a module, but rather a type declaration file that provides type information for other modules in your project.

To use the `AuthKeyT` type in your React component, you need to make sure that the type declaration file is included in your project's TypeScript configuration. You can do this by adding the following line to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*",
    "src/@types/*" // Add this line to include the type declaration file
  ]
}
```

Once you have done this, you should be able to import the `AuthKeyT` type in your React component like this:

```
import { AuthKeyT } from 'app'
```

If you are still seeing the "Cannot find module 'app'" error, make sure that the module that exports the `AuthKeyT` type is actually named `app`. You may need to adjust the import statement to match the actual name of the module.

The error message you are seeing is because TypeScript does not allow importing type declarations directly. Instead, you should import the module that exports the type declaration.

// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../types/app';

// use AuthKeyT in your component
```

Make sure that the path to your `app.ts` file is correct. If it is located in a different directory, adjust the import path accordingly.

Also, make sure that your TypeScript configuration is set up correctly to include the `types` directory in the `include` section of your `tsconfig.json` file:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*",
    "types/**/*"
  ]
}
``` 

This should allow TypeScript to find your custom type declaration.
