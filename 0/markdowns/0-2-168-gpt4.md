I see people recommending that whenever one uses `target="_blank"` in a link to open it in a different window, they should put `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. I wonder how does this prevent me from using Developer Tools in Chrome, for example, and removing the rel attribute. Then clicking the link...

Is that an easy way to still keep the vulnerability?

The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is not meant to prevent someone from using Developer Tools to manipulate the HTML on their own browser. It's meant to protect users from a specific type of vulnerability known as "tabnapping" or "reverse tabnapping".

When you open a new window using `target="_blank"`, the new page runs on the same process as your page and with the `window.opener` property, it can potentially navigate your page to a different URL. This can be used in phishing attacks where the new page navigates the original page to a fake version of a website and prompts the user to enter their credentials.

By using `rel="noopener"`, you're preventing the new page from having the ability to manipulate `window.opener`. The `noreferrer` part also prevents the new page from knowing where the traffic came from, which can be useful for privacy reasons.

As for your question, yes, if someone with malicious intent has access to the Developer Tools and can remove these attributes, then the vulnerability is still there. But this would require the user to intentionally do this, which is unlikely in most cases. The attribute is there to protect users from unknowingly being exploited by this vulnerability.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is not intended to prevent someone from using Developer Tools to manipulate the webpage. It's intended to prevent a specific type of vulnerability known as "tabnapping" or "reverse tabnapping".

When you open a link in a new tab with `target="_blank"`, the new page has access to the `window.opener` property, which points to the previous page. This means the new page can potentially redirect the previous page to a malicious URL, or even run scripts on the previous page if both pages are on the same origin.

Adding `rel="noopener"` prevents the new page from accessing the `window.opener` property. Adding `rel="noreferrer"` also prevents the new page from knowing where the traffic came from.

If someone is able to use Developer Tools to remove the `rel` attribute, then they already have control over the webpage and can do much more harmful things than just removing that attribute. The attribute is there to protect users who are just browsing the web, not to protect against someone who has the ability to modify the webpage.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is not meant to prevent someone with access to the Developer Tools from modifying the page's HTML. It's meant to protect users from a specific type of vulnerability called "tabnapping" or "reverse tabnapping".

When you open a link in a new tab with `target="_blank"`, the new page can access the original page via the `window.opener` property. This can be exploited by malicious websites to redirect the original page to a different URL, which can be used for phishing attacks.

The `rel="noopener"` attribute prevents the new page from accessing the `window.opener` property. The `rel="noreferrer"` attribute goes a step further and also prevents the Referer header from being sent to the new page.

If someone has access to the Developer Tools and can modify the page's HTML, they can do a lot more than just remove the `rel` attribute. They could inject scripts, modify the page's content, etc. But this requires either physical access to the machine or remote access via some sort of malware, both of which are much bigger security issues than a potential tabnapping attack.

In other words, the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is not meant to protect against someone with access to the Developer Tools. It's meant to protect regular users who are just clicking on links.
