I'm stuck at `geolocation`. Actually it working fine but some problem appear when I using `If else`. When User click allow location it working but the problem appear when user click not allow, it not insert in `else`. This [DEMO](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-geolocation-blitz-yvyeyv) as reference.



```
ngOnInit() {
       this.getUserLocation();
    }

    getUserLocation() {
       if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
          });
    }else {
       console.log("User not allow")

    }
}
```

The problem is that the `else` block in your code is executed when the browser does not support the Geolocation API, not when the user denies the location permission.

The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` function takes a second argument which is a function that will be called when an error occurs. This is where you should handle the case when the user denies the location permission.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
ngOnInit() {
    this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            position => {
                this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
                this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
            },
            error => {
                if (error.code === error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                    console.log("User denied the request for Geolocation.");
            }
        );
    } else {
        console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
    }
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the location permission, the error function will be called and "User denied the request for Geolocation." will be logged to the console. If the browser does not support the Geolocation API, "Geolocation is not supported by this browser." will be logged to the console.

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the `else` statement in your code is not actually handling the case where the user denies the location permission. The `if (navigator.geolocation)` check is only verifying if the geolocation API is available in the user's browser, not whether the user has granted or denied permission.

The `getCurrentPosition` method takes a second argument which is an error handling function. This function will be called if the user denies the location permission. Here's how you can modify your code to handle this:

```javascript
ngOnInit() {
   this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
   if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
        },
        error => {
            // This will be called if the user denies location permission
            console.log("User not allow");
        }
    );
   } else {
       console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
   }
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the location permission, the error handling function will be called and "User not allow" will be logged to the console.

The problem is that the `else` block in your code is not for handling the case when the user denies the permission for geolocation. It is for the case when the geolocation feature is not available in the user's browser at all.

The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method takes a second argument which is a function that will be called when an error occurs. This is where you should handle the case when the user denies the permission.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
ngOnInit() {
    this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            position => {
                this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
                this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
            },
            error => {
                if (error.code === error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                    console.log("User denied the request for Geolocation.");
            }
        );
    } else {
        console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
    }
}
```

In the above code, if the user denies the permission for geolocation, the error function will be called and "User denied the request for Geolocation." will be logged to the console.
