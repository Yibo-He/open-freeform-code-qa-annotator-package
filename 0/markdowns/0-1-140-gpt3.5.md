I integrated Font Awesome 5 in a project with bootstrap 4. When I recall a font via CSS it does not work.
with Font Awesome 4 the code was as follows:

```
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "FontAwesome";
}
```


I tried to change the font name but it does not work

```
font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'
```

With Font Awesome 5, the font family name has changed. You need to use the following font family name:

```
font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
```

Also, make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project. You can include it using the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css" integrity="sha384-4oV9txTYmz8v+6Xz6TiQqVgXuZxO+KaS40+q9yZzP5TCF0sw7I1lZg6QL0UuZ/hU" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

Make sure that you have included this code before your custom CSS code.

With Font Awesome 5, the font family name has changed. You can use the following code to call the Font Awesome 5 icon:

```
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Note that the font-weight property is also required to properly display the icon. You can adjust the font-weight value to change the thickness of the icon.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

With Font Awesome 5, you need to use a different font family name. Try using the following code instead:

```
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Note that I added `font-weight: 900` to ensure that the icon is displayed correctly. Also, make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
