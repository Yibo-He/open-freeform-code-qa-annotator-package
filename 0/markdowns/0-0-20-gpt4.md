I just read in the `styled-components` [documentation](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props) that the following is wrong and it will affect render times. If that is the case, how can I refactor the code and use the required props to create a dynamic style?

Thank you in advance.



```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
    const TabWrapper = styled.li`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 100px;
    margin: 1px;
    font-size: 3em;
    color: ${props => (isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
    background-color: ${props => (isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
    cursor: ${props => (isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

    return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}


export default Tab
```

The issue with your current implementation is that you are defining the styled component inside your component function. This means that a new styled component is created every time your component re-renders, which is inefficient and can lead to performance issues.

To fix this, you should define your styled component outside of your component function and pass the props you need to it. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 100px;
    margin: 1px;
    font-size: 3em;
    color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
    background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
    cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
    return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, `TabWrapper` is defined outside of the `Tab` component, so it's not recreated on every render. The `isSelected` prop is passed to `TabWrapper` when it's used in `Tab`, so it can still dynamically adjust its styles based on whether the tab is selected.

The issue with your current code is that you're defining the `TabWrapper` styled component inside your `Tab` component. This means that a new `TabWrapper` is created every time `Tab` is rendered, which is inefficient.

You should define your styled components outside of your render method (or functional component body). You can still make the styles dynamic by passing props to the styled component. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 100px;
    margin: 1px;
    font-size: 3em;
    color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
    background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
    cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
    return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, `TabWrapper` is only created once, and then reused with different props for each `Tab`. This is more efficient and will improve render times.

The issue with your code is that you're defining `TabWrapper` inside the `Tab` component. This means that a new `TabWrapper` is created every time `Tab` is rendered, which is inefficient and can lead to performance issues.

To fix this, you should define `TabWrapper` outside of the `Tab` component. You can still pass props to `TabWrapper` to make it dynamic. Here's how you can refactor your code:

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 100px;
    margin: 1px;
    font-size: 3em;
    color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
    background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
    cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
    return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, `TabWrapper` is defined outside of `Tab`, so a new `TabWrapper` isn't created every time `Tab` is rendered. The `isSelected` prop is passed to `TabWrapper` in the `Tab` component's return statement, so you can still use it to dynamically style `TabWrapper`.
