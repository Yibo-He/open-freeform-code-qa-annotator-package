Yes, I can recommend a few libraries that you can use to implement an international mobile number input in your Angular 9 application.

1. **ngx-intl-tel-input**: This is a very popular library for Angular applications. It provides an input field with a dropdown list of countries and their respective flags, and it also validates the phone number based on the selected country. You can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ngx-intl-tel-input

2. **ng2-tel-input**: This is another library that you can use. It's a bit older and not as popular as ngx-intl-tel-input, but it supports Angular 2+ and should work with Angular 9. You can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng2-tel-input

3. **angular4-intl-phone**: This library provides an Angular 4+ directive for formatting and validating international phone numbers. It uses Google's libphonenumber library. You can find it here: https://www.npmjs.com/package/angular4-intl-phone

Remember to check the documentation for each library to understand how to install and use it in your project.

Yes, I do have a recommendation. You can use the "ngx-intl-tel-input" library. It's an International Telephone Input field with country flags and codes for Angular. It's easy to use and highly customizable.

Here's how you can install and use it:

1. Install the package via npm:
```bash
npm install ngx-intl-tel-input --save
```

2. Import the NgxIntlTelInputModule in your module:
```javascript
import { NgxIntlTelInputModule } from 'ngx-intl-tel-input';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    // ...
    NgxIntlTelInputModule,
  ],
})
export class AppModule { }
```

3. Use it in your component:
```html
<form [formGroup]="form">
  <ngx-intl-tel-input
    [cssClass]="'your-custom-class'"
    [preferredCountries]="['us', 'gb']"
    [enableAutoCountrySelect]="true"
    [enablePlaceholder]="true"
    [searchCountryFlag]="true"
    [searchCountryField]="['iso2', 'name']"
    [selectFirstCountry]="false"
    [selectedCountryISO]="CountryISO.UnitedStates"
    [maxLength]="10"
    [phoneValidation]="true"
    [inputId]="'phone'"
    [allowDropdown]="true"
    [onlyNumbers]="false"
    formControlName="phone">
  </ngx-intl-tel-input>
</form>
```

4. In your component.ts file:
```javascript
import { FormGroup, FormBuilder, Validators } from '@angular/forms';
import { CountryISO } from 'ngx-intl-tel-input';

export class AppComponent {
  form: FormGroup;
  CountryISO = CountryISO;

  constructor(private fb: FormBuilder) {
    this.form = this.fb.group({
      phone: ['', [Validators.required]]
    });
  }
}
```

Please note that you need to have ReactiveFormsModule imported in your module where you're using this component.

This library is compatible with Angular 9 and should meet your needs for an international phone input.
