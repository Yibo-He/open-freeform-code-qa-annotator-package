This is only an issue in Safari and looks like a Safari bug to me. Here is a [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/0scrgd9j/) with a simplified version of the issue.

When an image is in a nested flexbox element with a width set and `height: auto` it is being stretched... the auto height is not working. Does something extra need to be added for this to work in Safari?

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```
```
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
  </section>
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
  </section>
</div>
```



I expect the height of the image to automatically be adjusted to maintain aspect ratio. This works in all browsers except Safari. In Safari the image is stretched and the auto height does not work.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

This is a known issue in Safari where the `height: auto` property does not work as expected on flexbox items. One workaround is to set the `align-items` property of the flex container to `flex-start`. Here's the updated CSS:

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start; /* workaround for Safari */
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should fix the issue in Safari and maintain the aspect ratio of the images.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

This is a known issue in Safari where it does not properly calculate the height of flex items with images that have a width set and `height: auto`. One workaround is to set a max-height on the image instead of using `height: auto`. 

You can try updating your CSS to the following:

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

This should maintain the aspect ratio of the image and prevent it from being stretched in Safari.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

This is a known issue in Safari where it doesn't properly calculate the height of images with `height: auto` inside nested flexbox containers. One workaround is to set a fixed height on the parent container of the image. 

In your case, you can add a fixed height to the `section` element that contains the image, like this:

```
.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
  height: 125px; /* add a fixed height */
}
```

This will ensure that the image maintains its aspect ratio and doesn't get stretched in Safari.
