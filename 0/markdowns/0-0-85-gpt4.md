I want to set the primary and secondary color in my theme.js/theme.ts. Is there any way to do that?
I am used to work with Material UI components in my React projects.
It is possible to set a palette with 'primary' and 'secondary' there.
I mean something like this:
```
export const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: "#7bb9e8"
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#eb7f7f"
    }
  }
})
```

Yes, you can set primary and secondary colors in your theme.js or theme.ts file. The code you provided is a good example of how to do this using Material-UI's `createTheme` function.

Here's an example in TypeScript:

```typescript
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

And here's the same example in JavaScript:

```javascript
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

In both examples, the `createTheme` function is used to create a theme object with a palette that has primary and secondary colors. The `main` property is used to set the main color for each palette type. The theme object is then exported so it can be used in other parts of your application.

Yes, you can set the primary and secondary colors in your theme.js or theme.ts file in a similar way to how you've done it with Material UI. Here's how you can do it:

If you're using JavaScript:

```javascript
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "#7bb9e8",
    secondary: "#eb7f7f",
  },
};
```

If you're using TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Theme {
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
  };
}

export const theme: Theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "#7bb9e8",
    secondary: "#eb7f7f",
  },
};
```

Then, you can use these colors in your components like this:

```javascript
import { theme } from './theme';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: theme.colors.primary, backgroundColor: theme.colors.secondary }}>
      Hello, world!
    </div>
  );
}
```

Please note that this is a very basic example. Depending on your project setup and requirements, you might want to use a more sophisticated theming solution, such as styled-components' `ThemeProvider` or Emotion's `ThemeProvider`.

Yes, you can definitely set primary and secondary colors in your theme.js or theme.ts file. The code you've provided is a perfect example of how to do it using Material-UI's `createTheme` function in a React project.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
import { createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

In this code, `createTheme` is a function from Material-UI that generates a theme object. Inside this function, you can specify the primary and secondary colors of your theme by providing an object to the `palette` property. The `main` property inside `primary` and `secondary` objects is used to specify the main color for each.

After defining the theme, you can use it in your components with the `ThemeProvider` component from Material-UI:

```javascript
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import theme from './theme';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your components go here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

In this code, `ThemeProvider` is a React component that applies a theme to all its child components. You pass the theme object to the `theme` prop of `ThemeProvider`. Now, all your components inside `ThemeProvider` will have access to the theme.
