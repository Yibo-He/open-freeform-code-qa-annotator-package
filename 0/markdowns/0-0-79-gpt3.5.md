I am getting an error when trying to import a local file, though no problem when using npm packages.


# server.js



```
import express from 'express'
import next from 'next'

import apis from './src/server/api'
```



# api.js



```
export default {
  ello: 'bye',
  jamie: 'hey'
}
```



# Starting app



```
node --experimental-modules --inspect server.js
```



# Error



```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It looks like the error is caused by the fact that you are trying to import a local file using a relative path, but the path is incorrect. 

Make sure that the path to the `api.js` file is correct and that it is relative to the `server.js` file. 

Also, try adding the file extension to the import statement like this:

```
import apis from './src/server/api.js'
``` 

If the issue persists, you can try using the `path` module to resolve the correct path to the file. 

```
import path from 'path';
import apis from path.resolve(__dirname, './src/server/api.js');
``` 

This should resolve the correct path to the `api.js` file.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It looks like the error is caused by the fact that you are trying to import a local file using a relative path, but Node.js is unable to resolve the path correctly. 

To fix this, you can try using an absolute path instead of a relative path. For example, you can use the `__dirname` global variable to get the absolute path of the current module and then append the path to the `api.js` file. 

Here's an example:

```
import path from 'path';
import apis from path.join(__dirname, 'src', 'server', 'api');
```

This should resolve the path correctly and allow you to import the `api.js` file without any issues.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It looks like the error is caused by the fact that you are trying to import a local file using a relative path, but the path is incorrect. 

Make sure that the path to the `api.js` file is correct and that it is relative to the `server.js` file. 

For example, if the `api.js` file is located in the same directory as the `server.js` file, you can try changing the import statement to:

```
import apis from './api'
```

If the `api.js` file is located in a different directory, you will need to adjust the path accordingly.
