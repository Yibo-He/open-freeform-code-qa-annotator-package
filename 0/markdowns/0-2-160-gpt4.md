I'm new in Angular. I saw `sourcemap` in `tsconfig.json` and by default it is `"sourceMap": true`. I had few doubts and found [this link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21719562/javascript-map-files-javascript-source-maps) useful. Still I have the following doubt regarding the same.

I set `"sourceMap": false`, but couldn't find any change in the app. What will be the actual change if I set so?

The `sourceMap` option in `tsconfig.json` is used for debugging purposes. When you set `"sourceMap": true`, the TypeScript compiler generates corresponding `.map` files for each `.js` file it outputs. These `.map` files are source maps - they are a way to map a combined/minified file back to an unbuilt state. 

When you debug your TypeScript code, the debugger uses the source map to show the code like you wrote it, not like it's translated into JavaScript. This is extremely useful because it allows you to debug your original TypeScript code directly.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the TypeScript compiler will not generate these `.map` files. This means that if you try to debug your TypeScript code, the debugger will show the compiled JavaScript code, not your original TypeScript code. 

However, you might not notice any immediate change in your app's behavior or performance because source maps are not used during the normal execution of your app. They are only used when you're debugging your code. 

So, if you're not debugging your app, you won't see any difference whether you set `"sourceMap"` to `true` or `false`. But if you are debugging, and you set `"sourceMap": false`, you'll find that you can't debug your TypeScript code as easily or as effectively.

Setting `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript files.

Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript files back to the original TypeScript files. They are used for debugging purposes. When you debug your Angular application in a browser, the browser uses the source maps to show the TypeScript code, which is much easier to understand and debug than the compiled JavaScript code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the debugging process will become more difficult because the browser will only show the compiled JavaScript code, not the original TypeScript code. However, you might not notice any difference in the behavior of your application because source maps do not affect the runtime behavior of your application. They are only used for development and debugging.

In summary, if you are not planning to debug your application or if you are okay with debugging the compiled JavaScript code, you can set `"sourceMap": false`. Otherwise, it's recommended to leave it as `"sourceMap": true`.

Setting `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file means that the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript files.

Source maps are files that associate the compiled JavaScript code with the original TypeScript code. They are used by debugging tools (like browser DevTools) to display the original TypeScript code when you're debugging, instead of the compiled JavaScript code. This makes debugging easier because you can read and understand your original code, not the compiled code.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the debugging tools will show the compiled JavaScript code instead of the original TypeScript code. This might make debugging more difficult because the compiled code can be harder to read and understand.

However, in a production environment, you might want to set `"sourceMap": false` to reduce the size of your deployment package and to hide your source code from users. 

Remember, the change will not affect the functionality of your app, it only affects the debugging process.
