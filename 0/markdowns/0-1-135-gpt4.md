This is only an issue in Safari and looks like a Safari bug to me. Here is a [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/0scrgd9j/) with a simplified version of the issue.

When an image is in a nested flexbox element with a width set and `height: auto` it is being stretched... the auto height is not working. Does something extra need to be added for this to work in Safari?

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```
```
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
  </section>
  <section>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
  </section>
</div>
```



I expect the height of the image to automatically be adjusted to maintain aspect ratio. This works in all browsers except Safari. In Safari the image is stretched and the auto height does not work.

This is indeed a known issue with Safari and flexbox. Safari has some issues with flexbox and `height:auto`. 

A workaround for this issue is to use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will prevent Safari from stretching the image.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make your images display correctly in Safari.

This is indeed a known issue with Safari and its handling of flexbox and images. Safari has some problems with the `height: auto` property on images within flex containers.

To fix this issue, you can use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which in this case is vertical, and it will stop the image from stretching.

Here is the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should solve your problem in Safari without affecting the layout in other browsers.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

This is a known issue with Safari and flexbox. Safari has some problems with `height: auto` for images inside a flex container. 

A workaround for this issue is to wrap the image in a div and apply the flex properties to the div instead of the image. 

Here is an updated version of your code:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container .img-container {
  width: 125px;
}

.container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

In this version, the `img` tag is wrapped in a div with class `img-container`. The `width: 125px;` is applied to `.img-container` and the `img` tag has `width: 100%;` and `height: auto;`. This should maintain the aspect ratio of the image in Safari.
