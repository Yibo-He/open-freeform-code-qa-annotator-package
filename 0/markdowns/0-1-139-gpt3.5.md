How should I deal with responsive breakpoints as components in Tailwind?

Without Tailwind, I used to declare breakpoints as a scss mixins:

```
@mixin tablet-portrait {
  @media (min-width: 700px) {
    @content;
  }
}
```


Then:

```
@include tablet-portrait {
  // whatever
}
```


I know that Tailwind has responsive utility clases to use it inline as `md:color-red` but I need to abstract this breakpoins as components, as in above example.

How should I extract Tailwind breakpoints from Tailwind config file?

You can extract the breakpoints from the Tailwind config file by accessing the `theme` object and looking for the `screens` property. This property contains an object with the breakpoints defined in your Tailwind configuration.

Here's an example of how you can extract the breakpoints and use them in your own mixins:

```
// Import the Tailwind configuration
const tailwindConfig = require('tailwindcss/defaultConfig');

// Extract the breakpoints from the configuration
const breakpoints = tailwindConfig.theme.screens;

// Define your own mixin using the breakpoints
const tabletPortrait = (content) => `
  @media (min-width: ${breakpoints.md}) {
    ${content}
  }
`;

// Use the mixin in your CSS
.my-class {
  ${tabletPortrait(`
    color: red;
  `)}
}
```

In this example, we're importing the default Tailwind configuration and extracting the breakpoints from the `screens` property. We then define our own mixin using the `md` breakpoint and use it in our CSS.

You can define your own mixins for each breakpoint by accessing the corresponding key in the `screens` object. For example, `breakpoints.sm` for the small breakpoint.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can extract the breakpoints from the Tailwind config file by accessing the `theme` object and then the `screens` property. Here's an example:

```
const { screens } = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');

console.log(screens);
```

This will output an object with the default breakpoints defined by Tailwind:

```
{
  'sm': '640px',
  'md': '768px',
  'lg': '1024px',
  'xl': '1280px',
  '2xl': '1536px',
}
```

You can then use these breakpoints to create your own mixins or functions, like this:

```
const { screens } = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');

function tabletPortrait(css) {
  return `@media (min-width: ${screens['md']}) {
    ${css}
  }`;
}

// Usage:
const myStyles = `
  color: red;
`;

const tabletPortraitStyles = tabletPortrait(myStyles);
```

This will output the following CSS:

```
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  color: red;
}
```

You can also use the `@apply` directive to apply Tailwind classes within your custom mixins or functions, like this:

```
const { screens } = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');

function tabletPortrait(css) {
  return `@media (min-width: ${screens['md']}) {
    @apply bg-gray-100;
    ${css}
  }`;
}

// Usage:
const myStyles = `
  color: red;
`;

const tabletPortraitStyles = tabletPortrait(myStyles);
```

This will output the following CSS:

```
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  background-color: #f7fafc;
  color: red;
}
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can extract the breakpoints from the Tailwind config file by accessing the `theme` object and looking for the `screens` property. This property contains an object with the breakpoint names as keys and the corresponding screen sizes as values.

Here's an example of how you can extract the breakpoints as mixins in SCSS:

```
@each $breakpoint, $size in theme('screens') {
  @mixin #{$breakpoint} {
    @media (min-width: #{$size}) {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
```

This will create mixins for each breakpoint defined in the Tailwind config file, which you can then use in your styles like this:

```
@include md {
  // styles for medium screens and above
}
``` 

Hope this helps!
