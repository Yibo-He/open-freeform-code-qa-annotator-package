I am beginner web developer. I have in my website accordion:  [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/)
and this code:
```
<div class="accordion pb-3" id="accordionExample">
                    <div class="accordion-item">
                        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
                            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
                                name and surname
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                        <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="background-color: red;">
                            <div class="accordion-body">
                                This is aółóźńthe first item's accordion body.It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
```

It's work fine. I would like to change the accordion arrow color to green. How can this be done?
Please help me

The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter to it. 

Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may need to adjust the filter value to get the exact color you want */
    filter: invert(48%) sepia(99%) saturate(1362%) hue-rotate(106deg) brightness(96%) contrast(91%);
}
```

This CSS rule targets the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class, which is where the arrow image is located. The `filter` property is used to apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

In this case, we're using a combination of different filter functions to change the color of the arrow. You may need to adjust the values to get the exact color you want.

Add this CSS to your stylesheet or in a `<style>` tag in your HTML file.

The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter to it. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a custom class to your accordion button. Let's call it `custom-accordion-button`.

```html
<button class="accordion-button custom-accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

Then, in your CSS, you can apply a filter to change the color of the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.custom-accordion-button::after {
    /* This is a Bootstrap 5 built-in class for accordion button */
    /* You can change the color by adjusting the hue-rotate degree */
    filter: invert(36%) sepia(93%) saturate(3443%) hue-rotate(106deg) brightness(102%) contrast(104%);
}
```

The `filter` property applies graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

In this case, we're using a combination of different filter functions to achieve the desired color. You can adjust the values to get the exact color you want.

Please note that this solution might not work in all browsers, as the support for CSS filters is not universal.

The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a custom class to your accordion button. Let's call it `custom-accordion-button`:

```html
<button class="accordion-button custom-accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

Then, in your CSS, you can apply a filter to this class to change the color of the arrow. The `hue-rotate` filter can be used to change the color. The value of `hue-rotate` is an angle, so `120deg` will rotate the color wheel by 120 degrees, which should change the color from the default black to green:

```css
.custom-accordion-button::after {
    filter: hue-rotate(120deg);
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. Note that the exact color will depend on the original color of the arrow and the degree of rotation. You may need to adjust the value to get the exact color you want.

Also, please note that CSS filters are not supported in Internet Explorer.
