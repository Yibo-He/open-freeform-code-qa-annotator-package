Similar to "[How to detect if OS X is in dark mode?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25207077/how-to-detect-if-os-x-is-in-dark-mode)" only for browsers.

Has anyone found if there is a way to detect if the user's system is in the new OS X Dark Mode in Safari/Chrome/Firefox?

We would like to change our site's design to be dark-mode friendly based on the current operating mode.

Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in browsers. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query: This media query allows you to detect if the user has set their system to use a light or dark color scheme. You can use it in your CSS to apply different styles based on the user's preference. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for dark mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Styles for light mode */
}
```

2. Using the `matchMedia` JavaScript method: You can use the `matchMedia` method to check if the user's system is in Dark Mode and then apply different styles accordingly. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Apply dark mode styles
} else {
  // Apply light mode styles
}
```

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query yet, so you may need to use a JavaScript fallback for those browsers.

Also, keep in mind that the user can override their system's color scheme preference in their browser settings, so it's not always a reliable indicator of the user's preference.

Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in browsers using CSS media queries and JavaScript.

In CSS, you can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

In JavaScript, you can use the `matchMedia` method to check if the user's system is in Dark Mode. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User is in Dark Mode
} else {
  // User is not in Dark Mode
}
```

Note that the `prefers-color-scheme` media query and `matchMedia` method are not supported in all browsers, so you may need to use a fallback method for older browsers.

Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in browsers using CSS media queries and JavaScript.

In CSS, you can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

In JavaScript, you can use the `matchMedia` method to check if the `prefers-color-scheme` media query matches. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User is in Dark Mode
} else {
  // User is not in Dark Mode
}
```

Note that this feature is only supported in modern browsers. If the browser does not support `prefers-color-scheme`, it will default to the light mode.
