I'm presently learning React-Testing-Library.
I'd like to test mouse interaction with an element. Presently it's a bit unclear to me the difference between userEvent.click(element) and fireEvent.click(element). Are both recommended for use, and in the example below are they being correctly implemented?
```
const mockFunction = jest.fn(() => console.info('button clicked'));
const { getByTestId } = render(<MyAwesomeButton onClick={mockFunction} />);
const myAwesomeButton = getByTestId('my-awesome-button');

// Solution A
fireEvent(myAwesomeButton)
expect(mockFunction.toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);

// Solution B
userEvent.click(myAwesomeButton);
expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```

Thanks in advance for any clarity.

Great question! Both `userEvent.click(element)` and `fireEvent.click(element)` can be used to simulate a user clicking on an element, but there are some differences between the two.

`userEvent.click(element)` is a higher-level API that simulates more realistic user interactions. It not only triggers the click event on the element, but also simulates the mouse down and mouse up events that typically precede and follow a click event. This can be useful for testing more complex interactions, such as drag-and-drop or double-clicking.

`fireEvent.click(element)` is a lower-level API that simply triggers the click event on the element. It doesn't simulate the mouse down and mouse up events, so it may not be as realistic as `userEvent.click(element)`.

In your example, both solutions A and B should work correctly. Solution A uses `fireEvent.click(element)` to trigger the click event on the button, while solution B uses `userEvent.click(element)` to simulate a more realistic user interaction. Since your goal is to test the `onClick` function, either solution should work fine. However, if you were testing a more complex interaction, such as drag-and-drop, you would likely need to use `userEvent` to simulate the full interaction.

Great question! Both `userEvent.click(element)` and `fireEvent.click(element)` can be used to simulate a mouse click on an element in React-Testing-Library. However, there are some differences between the two.

`userEvent.click(element)` is a higher-level API that simulates a user's interaction with an element more realistically. It not only triggers a click event on the element but also simulates other events that a user might trigger, such as focus, blur, and pointer events. This can be useful when testing complex user interactions, such as drag-and-drop or keyboard navigation.

On the other hand, `fireEvent.click(element)` is a lower-level API that only triggers a click event on the element. It does not simulate other events that a user might trigger. This can be useful when you only need to test the click event itself and not the entire user interaction.

In your example, both Solution A and Solution B should work correctly. However, Solution B using `userEvent.click(element)` is recommended because it simulates a more realistic user interaction with the button. Additionally, `userEvent` has some other useful methods, such as `userEvent.type(element, text)` for simulating user typing, that can make your tests more realistic and reliable.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Great question! Both `userEvent.click(element)` and `fireEvent.click(element)` can be used to simulate a mouse click on an element in React-Testing-Library. However, there are some differences between the two.

`userEvent.click(element)` is a higher-level API that simulates user interactions with an element, including mouse clicks, keyboard events, and more. It tries to simulate the way a real user would interact with the element, so it's a good choice for testing user flows and interactions.

`fireEvent.click(element)` is a lower-level API that directly fires a click event on the element. It's useful for testing specific event handlers and edge cases.

In your example, both solutions A and B should work correctly. Solution A uses `fireEvent.click(element)` to directly fire a click event on the button, while Solution B uses `userEvent.click(element)` to simulate a user clicking on the button. Since your goal is to test the `onClick` handler, either solution should work fine.

However, if you were testing a more complex user flow that involved multiple interactions with the button (e.g. clicking, typing, hovering), `userEvent` would be a better choice since it simulates more realistic user behavior.
