It seems like there is an issue with the gradlew.bat file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Close your project and open the Android Studio.
2. Click on "File" -> "Invalidate Caches / Restart".
3. In the pop-up window, click on "Invalidate and Restart".
4. Wait for Android Studio to restart.
5. Open your project again and try running the "react-native link" command.

If the above steps do not work, you can try the following:

1. Open the "android" folder in your project.
2. Delete the "gradle" folder.
3. Run the "react-native link" command again.

If the issue still persists, you can try updating your gradle version. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open the "android" folder in your project.
2. Open the "gradle/wrapper" folder.
3. Open the "gradle-wrapper.properties" file.
4. Change the "distributionUrl" to the latest version of gradle. For example, "distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.5-all.zip".
5. Save the file and run the "react-native link" command again.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue.

This error occurs when the Gradle wrapper script is unable to download the Gradle distribution specified in the project's Gradle wrapper files. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Check your internet connection and try again. Sometimes, the download may fail due to a poor internet connection.

2. Try deleting the `gradle` folder in your project's root directory and run the `react-native link` command again. This will force the Gradle wrapper to download the distribution again.

3. If the above solutions don't work, you can try manually downloading the Gradle distribution and placing it in the `gradle/wrapper` directory of your project. You can download the distribution from the Gradle website.

4. Another solution is to update the Gradle version in your project's `android/build.gradle` file. You can try changing the `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'` to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.0'` or a higher version.

I hope one of these solutions works for you.

The error message indicates that the Gradle build tool is unable to find the Java Development Kit (JDK) on your system. You need to install the JDK and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to its installation directory.

Here are the steps to install the JDK and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable:

1. Download the JDK from the official website: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html

2. Install the JDK on your system.

3. Set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to the installation directory of the JDK. The exact steps to set the environment variable depend on your operating system.

   - On Windows: 
     - Open the Control Panel and go to System and Security > System > Advanced system settings.
     - Click the Environment Variables button.
     - Under System Variables, click the New button.
     - Enter JAVA_HOME as the variable name and the installation directory of the JDK as the variable value (e.g. C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_281).
     - Click OK to save the variable.

   - On macOS or Linux:
     - Open a terminal window.
     - Enter the following command to open the .bash_profile file: `nano ~/.bash_profile`
     - Add the following line to the file: `export JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_281.jdk/Contents/Home` (replace the path with the installation directory of the JDK).
     - Press Ctrl+X to exit nano and save the file.
     - Enter the following command to reload the .bash_profile file: `source ~/.bash_profile`

4. Restart your terminal or command prompt to apply the changes.

After setting the JAVA_HOME environment variable, try running the `react-native link` command again and see if the error is resolved.
