I have a Vue-cli app that I'm trying to convert to vite. I am using Docker to run the server. I looked at a couple tutorials and got vite to run in development mode without errors. However, the browser can't access the port. That is, when I'm on my macbook's command line (outside of Docker) I can't `curl` it:
```
$ curl localhost:8080
curl: (52) Empty reply from server
```

If I try localhost:8081 I get `Failed to connect`. In addition, if I run the webpack dev server it works normally so I know that my container's port is exposed.
Also, if I run curl in the same virtual machine that is running the vite server it works, so I know that vite is working.
Here are the details:
In package.json:
```
...
"dev": "vue-cli-service serve",
"vite": "vite",
...
```

The entire vite.config.ts file:
```
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

The command that starts the container:
```
docker-compose run --publish 8080:8080 --rm app bash
```

The docker-compose.yml file:
```
version: '3.7'

services:
  app:
    image: myapp
    build: .
    container_name: myapp
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
```

The Dockerfile:
```
FROM node:16.10.0

RUN npm install -g npm@8.1.3
RUN npm install -g @vue/cli@4.5.15

RUN mkdir /srv/app && chown node:node /srv/app

USER node

WORKDIR /srv/app
```

The command that I run inside the docker container for vite:
```
npm run vite
```

The command that I run inside the docker container for vue-cli:
```
npm run dev
```

So, to summarize: my setup works when running the vue-cli dev server but doesn't work when using the vite dev server.

The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server configuration. By default, Vite's development server only accepts connections from localhost for security reasons. This means that when you're running Vite inside a Docker container, it won't accept connections from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to accept connections from any origin. You can do this by setting the `host` option to `0.0.0.0` in your Vite configuration file. Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Accept connections from any origin
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.

The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside of the Docker container. You need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it can be accessed from outside the container.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This will tell Vite to bind to all network interfaces, making it accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server at `localhost:8080` from your host machine.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server defaulting to localhost, which in the context of a Docker container, is the container itself. This means that the server is not accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to tell Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost. You can do this by setting the `host` option in the `server` section of your Vite config to `0.0.0.0`.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible from outside the Docker container.
