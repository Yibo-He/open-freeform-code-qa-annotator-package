## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

This error occurs because the `graphql-upload` package does not have a `main` field defined in its `package.json` file. To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `graphql-upload` package to the latest version by running `npm install graphql-upload@latest`.

2. If the issue persists, try adding the following line to your `package.json` file:

   `"type": "module"`

   This tells Node.js to treat your project as an ECMAScript module, which may help resolve the issue.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different package for handling file uploads in GraphQL, such as `apollo-upload-server` or `graphql-multipart-request-spec`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

This error occurs when the package you are trying to import does not have a main export defined in its package.json file. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the graphql-upload package has been installed correctly by running `npm ls graphql-upload` in your project directory. If it is not installed, run `npm install graphql-upload` to install it.

2. If the package is installed, try deleting the node_modules folder and running `npm install` again to reinstall all dependencies.

3. If the issue persists, you can try downgrading the graphql-upload package to version 13.0.0 by running `npm install graphql-upload@13.0.0`.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different package for handling file uploads in GraphQL, such as apollo-upload-server or multer-graphql.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

This error occurs when the package you are trying to import does not have a main export defined in its package.json file. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if there is a newer version of graphql-upload available. If so, update your package.json file to use the latest version and run `npm install` again.

2. If updating the package does not work, you can try importing the package using a different syntax. Instead of using the named import, try using the default import like this:

```
const { default: graphqlUploadExpress } = require('graphql-upload');
```

3. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different package for handling file uploads in GraphQL, such as `apollo-upload-server` or `graphql-multipart-request-spec`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
