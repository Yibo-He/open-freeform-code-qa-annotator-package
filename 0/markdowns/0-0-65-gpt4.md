I have a simple example of a component: 

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);
  console.log(observed.current);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```


I would expect that `observed.current` would be of type element and current would not be empty but the div element with all its properties. My understanding would be:


1. The ref is initialised with a value of null
2. Null is overwritten by the ref



But as it turns out, `.current` remains empty. This is bad since I want to pass observed to a function that expects an argument of type Element.

The reason `observed.current` is `null` at the time of logging is because the logging happens during the initial render, at which point the `ref` has not yet been attached to the `div`. 

React `ref` updates happen before the component updates, but after the render is complete. This means that if you want to log the `ref` after it has been attached to the `div`, you should do so in a `useEffect` hook, which runs after the render is complete.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In this code, `useEffect` is used to schedule a side effect that runs after the render is complete. The empty array `[]` passed as the second argument to `useEffect` ensures that the side effect only runs once, after the initial render. This way, you can be sure that the `ref` has been attached to the `div` by the time the `console.log` statement runs.

The reason `observed.current` is `null` at the time of logging is because the log statement is being executed during the initial render of the component, at which point the `ref` has not yet been attached to the `div`. 

React `ref`s are updated after the render is committed to the screen. So, if you want to access the `ref` after it's been attached to the `div`, you can use the `useEffect` hook, which runs after the render is committed to the screen.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In this code, `useEffect` is used with an empty dependency array `[]`, which means it will only run once after the first render. At this point, `observed.current` will point to the `div` element.

The `useRef` hook is used to create a mutable ref object whose `.current` property is initialized with the passed argument (`null` in this case). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

The reason why `observed.current` is `null` at the time of logging is because the `console.log(observed.current);` is executed during the render phase, but the ref is not attached to the DOM element until after the component is rendered and the DOM is updated. This is why you are seeing `null` in the console.

If you want to access the ref after it's been attached, you can use the `useEffect` hook, which runs after the render is committed to the screen:

```jsx
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In the above code, `useEffect` is used to schedule a side effect that runs after render. The side effect logs the `observed.current` to the console. Since the empty array `[]` is passed as the second argument to `useEffect`, the side effect runs only once after the initial render, when the ref is already attached to the DOM element.
