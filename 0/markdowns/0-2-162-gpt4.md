Is there any way to change background color dynamically on scroll?

For example, refer this site([https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/](https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/))

When you first access that site, background color is blue.

While scroll down, it's color change to black smoothly.

Also see this site(`codepen.io/Funsella/pen/yLfAG/`)

Second site is same with first. But it's color changed at once.

But first site's color is not change at once.

It changed gradually related to scroll position.

```
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
.section1 {
  background-color: white;
  height: 100%;
}
.section2 {
  background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654);
  height: 100%;
}
```
```
<html>
<body>
  <section class="section1">
    SECTION1
  </section>
  <section class="section2">
    SECTION2
  </section>
</body>
</html>
```



Above code is what I'm worked on.

Current it's color is split by each section.

When I scroll down, I want to change color `background-color: white` -> `background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654)`

Is there any solution about this?

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript or jQuery along with CSS. Here is a simple example using jQuery:

First, include the jQuery library in your HTML file:

```html
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

Then, use the following jQuery code:

```javascript
$(window).scroll(function() {
  var scroll = $(window).scrollTop();
  if (scroll < 500) {
    $('.section1').css('background', 'white');
  } else {
    $('.section1').css('background', 'linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654)');
  }
});
```

This code changes the background color of `.section1` based on the scroll position. When the scroll position is less than 500, the background color is white. When the scroll position is 500 or more, the background color changes to a gradient.

However, this will result in an abrupt change. If you want a smooth transition, you can add a transition in your CSS:

```css
.section1 {
  transition: background 2s ease;
}
```

This will make the background color change over a period of 2 seconds.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not work perfectly for your needs. You might need to adjust the scroll position and the transition duration to get the desired effect. Also, this example assumes that you are scrolling vertically. If you are scrolling horizontally, you will need to use `scrollLeft` instead of `scrollTop`.

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript (or jQuery) to change the background color based on the scroll position. Here's a simple example using jQuery:

```html
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      height: 200vh;
      transition: background 1s linear;
    }
    .section1 {
      height: 100vh;
    }
    .section2 {
      height: 100vh;
    }
  </style>
  <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
  <script>
    $(document).ready(function(){
      $(window).scroll(function(){
        var scrollPos = $(window).scrollTop();
        var windowHeight = $(window).height();
        if(scrollPos <= windowHeight){
          var percentage = scrollPos / windowHeight;
          var gradient = "linear-gradient(to bottom, #ffffff " + (100 - percentage * 100) + "%, #f05fa6 " + (percentage * 100) + "%)";
          $("body").css("background", gradient);
        } else {
          $("body").css("background", "linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654)");
        }
      });
    });
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <section class="section1">
    SECTION1
  </section>
  <section class="section2">
    SECTION2
  </section>
</body>
</html>
```

In this example, we use the `scroll()` function to listen for scroll events. When the user scrolls, we calculate the scroll position as a percentage of the window height. We then use this percentage to create a linear gradient that transitions from white to pink as the user scrolls down the page. Once the user scrolls past the first section, the background color is set to a fixed gradient.

Please note that this is a very basic example and may not work perfectly in all situations. You may need to adjust the code to fit your specific needs.

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript in combination with CSS. The idea is to listen for the scroll event on the window and then calculate how far the user has scrolled as a percentage of the total scrollable height. This percentage is then used to interpolate between the start and end colors.

Here is a simple example using jQuery:

```html
<html>
<body>
  <section class="section1">
    SECTION1
  </section>
  <section class="section2">
    SECTION2
  </section>
</body>
<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.5.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
<script>
$(window).on('scroll', function() {
  var scrollTop = $(window).scrollTop();
  var docHeight = $(document).height();
  var winHeight = $(window).height();
  var scrollPercent = (scrollTop) / (docHeight - winHeight);
  var scrollPercentRounded = Math.round(scrollPercent*100);

  // Interpolate start and end colors
  var startColor = { r: 255, g: 255, b: 255 }; // white
  var endColor = { r: 240, g: 95, b: 166 }; // #f05fa6

  var r = startColor.r + scrollPercent * (endColor.r - startColor.r);
  var g = startColor.g + scrollPercent * (endColor.g - startColor.g);
  var b = startColor.b + scrollPercent * (endColor.b - startColor.b);

  $('body').css('background-color', 'rgb(' + r + ',' + g + ',' + b + ')');
});
</script>
</html>
```

In this example, the background color of the body will gradually change from white to #f05fa6 as you scroll down the page.

Please note that this is a very basic example and may not work perfectly in all situations. For a more robust solution, you may want to consider using a library like ScrollMagic or GSAP.
