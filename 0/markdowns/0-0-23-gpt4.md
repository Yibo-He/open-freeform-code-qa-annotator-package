Scenario is relatively simple: we have a long-running, on-demand calculation that occurs on a remote server. We want to memoize the result. Even though we are fetching asychronously from a remote resource, this isn't a side effect because we just want the result of this calculation to display to the user and we definitely don't want to do this on every render.

Problem: it seems that React.useMemo does not directly support Typescript's async/await and will return a promise:

```
//returns a promise: 
let myMemoizedResult = React.useMemo(() => myLongAsyncFunction(args), [args])
//also returns a promise:
let myMemoizedResult = React.useMemo(() => (async () => await myLongAsyncFunction(args)), [args])
```


What is the correct way to wait on the result from an asynchronous function and memoize the result using React.useMemo? I've used regular promises with plain JS but still struggle with them in these types of situations.

I've tried other approaches such as memoize-one, but the issue seems to be that the `this` context changes due to the way that React function components work [break the memoization](https://github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one#changes-to-this-is-considered-an-argument-change), which is why I'm trying to use React.useMemo.

Maybe I'm trying to fit a square peg in a round hole here - if that's the case it would be good to know that too. For now I'm probably just going to roll my own memoizing function.

Edit: I think part of it was that I was making a different silly mistake with memoize-one, but I'm still interested to know the answer here wrt React.memo.

Here's a snippet - the idea is not to use the memoized result directly in the render method, but rather as something to reference in an event-driven way i.e. on a Calculate button click.

```
export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
    let [arg, setArg] = React.useState('100');
    let [result, setResult] = React.useState('Not yet calculated');

    //My hang up at the moment is that myExpensiveResultObject is 
    //Promise<T> rather than T
    let myExpensiveResultObject = React.useMemo(
        async () => await SomeLongRunningApi(arg),
        [arg]
    );

    const getResult = () => {
        setResult(myExpensiveResultObject.interestingProperty);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Get your result:</p>
            <input value={arg} onChange={e => setArg(e.target.value)}></input>
            <button onClick={getResult}>Calculate</button>
            <p>{`Result is ${result}`}</p>
        </div>);
}
```

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that React's `useMemo` hook is not designed to handle asynchronous operations. It's meant to synchronously return a memoized value.

In your case, you're trying to use `useMemo` to memoize the result of an asynchronous operation, which is why you're getting a promise instead of the actual result.

One possible solution would be to use `useEffect` to handle the asynchronous operation and `useState` to store the result. Here's how you could modify your code:

```jsx
export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
    let [arg, setArg] = React.useState('100');
    let [result, setResult] = React.useState('Not yet calculated');

    React.useEffect(() => {
        const fetchResult = async () => {
            const resultObject = await SomeLongRunningApi(arg);
            setResult(resultObject.interestingProperty);
        };

        fetchResult();
    }, [arg]);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Get your result:</p>
            <input value={arg} onChange={e => setArg(e.target.value)}></input>
            <button onClick={() => setResult('Not yet calculated')}>Calculate</button>
            <p>{`Result is ${result}`}</p>
        </div>);
}
```

In this code, `useEffect` will run whenever `arg` changes. It will then call `SomeLongRunningApi` with the new `arg` value, and store the result in the `result` state. The `Calculate` button now just resets the `result` state to its initial value.

This way, you're not trying to use `useMemo` for something it's not designed to handle, and you're still effectively memoizing the result of the long-running operation.

React's `useMemo` hook is not designed to handle asynchronous operations. It's meant to be used for expensive calculations that you want to avoid repeating on every render, but it expects those calculations to be synchronous.

For handling asynchronous operations, you should use the `useEffect` hook. This hook is designed to handle side effects, including asynchronous operations.

Here's how you can modify your code to use `useEffect`:

```jsx
export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
    let [arg, setArg] = React.useState('100');
    let [result, setResult] = React.useState('Not yet calculated');

    React.useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const myExpensiveResultObject = await SomeLongRunningApi(arg);
            setResult(myExpensiveResultObject.interestingProperty);
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [arg]);

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Get your result:</p>
            <input value={arg} onChange={e => setArg(e.target.value)}></input>
            <button onClick={() => setResult('Not yet calculated')}>Calculate</button>
            <p>{`Result is ${result}`}</p>
        </div>);
}
```

In this code, `useEffect` will run every time `arg` changes. It will call the `fetchData` function, which is an asynchronous function that fetches the data and then sets the result. The `setResult` function will cause the component to re-render with the new result.

The button now resets the result to 'Not yet calculated' when clicked, which gives the user feedback that the calculation is in progress. The actual calculation is triggered by changing the input, not by clicking the button.

This approach has the advantage of giving the user feedback that the calculation is in progress, which is important for long-running calculations. It also ensures that the calculation is only performed when necessary, i.e., when `arg` changes.

The `React.useMemo` hook is not designed to handle asynchronous operations. It's meant to optimize synchronous, expensive computations. For handling asynchronous operations, you should use the `React.useEffect` hook.

Here's how you can modify your code to use `React.useEffect` and `React.useState` to handle the asynchronous operation and store the result:

```jsx
export const MyComponent: React.FC = () => {
    let [arg, setArg] = React.useState('100');
    let [result, setResult] = React.useState('Not yet calculated');
    let [myExpensiveResultObject, setMyExpensiveResultObject] = React.useState(null);

    React.useEffect(() => {
        const fetchData = async () => {
            const result = await SomeLongRunningApi(arg);
            setMyExpensiveResultObject(result);
        };

        fetchData();
    }, [arg]);

    const getResult = () => {
        if (myExpensiveResultObject) {
            setResult(myExpensiveResultObject.interestingProperty);
        }
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <p>Get your result:</p>
            <input value={arg} onChange={e => setArg(e.target.value)}></input>
            <button onClick={getResult}>Calculate</button>
            <p>{`Result is ${result}`}</p>
        </div>);
}
```

In this code, `React.useEffect` is used to call the asynchronous function `SomeLongRunningApi(arg)` whenever `arg` changes. The result of this function is stored in the state variable `myExpensiveResultObject` using the `setMyExpensiveResultObject` function. The `getResult` function then uses this state variable to update the `result` state variable.
