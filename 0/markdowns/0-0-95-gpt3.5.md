While running
```
npm run dev
```

I suddenly start getting error without pretty much any change to the code of the project:
```

Modifying the code of the app so it won't include any files or load anything still produces the same error.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

This error message suggests that there is an issue with the `postcss-scss` package. One possible solution is to try reinstalling the package by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install postcss-scss
```

If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling all packages by running:

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

If the issue persists, you can try upgrading your Node.js version or downgrading the `postcss-scss` package version to a previous stable version.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

This error message indicates that there is a problem with the `postcss-scss` package. It seems like the package is not being loaded correctly or there is an issue with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache and reinstall the dependencies by running the following commands:
```
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

2. Check if there are any updates available for the `postcss-scss` package by running the following command:
```
npm outdated postcss-scss
```

If there is an update available, try updating the package by running:
```
npm update postcss-scss
```

3. If the above steps do not work, try removing the `postcss-scss` package and reinstalling it by running the following commands:
```
npm uninstall postcss-scss
npm install postcss-scss
```

4. If none of the above steps work, try downgrading the `postcss-scss` package to a previous version that was working by running the following command:
```
npm install postcss-scss@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number that was working previously.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

This error message is related to the postcss-scss package. It seems like the package is not installed or not properly installed. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm install` to reinstall all the packages.
3. If the issue persists, try updating the `postcss-scss` package to the latest version by running `npm install postcss-scss@latest`.
4. If the issue still persists, try downgrading the `postcss-scss` package to the previous version by running `npm install postcss-scss@0.36.2`.

If none of the above steps work, you can try checking if there are any conflicts between the packages installed in your project. You can use the `npm ls` command to check for any dependency conflicts.
