I am getting image as base64 blob from a service and I am binding into
view. But I am facing an issue. How can I sanitize the url into a
trusted url. I have tried with sanitizer but no luck..
Please help me out..

```
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{{inspectionDetails.reportImage}}" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```


```
this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.ImgUrl);
```

It seems like you are on the right track. You are using Angular's DomSanitizer to sanitize the base64 image URL. However, you are not using the sanitized URL in your template. 

Here's how you can do it:

In your component:

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer, SafeResourceUrl } from '@angular/platform-browser';

export class YourComponent {
  base64Image: SafeResourceUrl;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('data:image/jpg;base64,' + this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In your template:

```html
<img [src]="base64Image" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```

In the above code, we are using property binding to bind the sanitized URL to the `src` attribute of the `img` tag. This way, Angular knows that the URL is safe to use.

It seems like you're on the right track. The Angular's DomSanitizer service is used to tell Angular that the value is safe to use in the specified context. The bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl method is used to bypass the security trust of a Resource URL.

Here's how you can use it:

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }

getSafeUrl() {
    return this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage);
}
```

And in your HTML:

```html
<img [src]="getSafeUrl()" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```

This should work if `inspectionDetails.reportImage` is a valid base64 image string. If it still doesn't work, you might want to check the value of `inspectionDetails.reportImage` to ensure it's a valid base64 image string.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

It seems like you're on the right track. The `bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl` method from Angular's DomSanitizer should be used to sanitize the base64 image URL. 

However, you need to ensure that you're binding the sanitized URL to your image source in your template. Here's how you can do it:

In your component:

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer, SafeResourceUrl } from '@angular/platform-browser';

// ...

base64Image: SafeResourceUrl;

constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }

ngOnInit() {
  this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
  this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('data:image/jpg;base64,' + this.ImgUrl);
}
```

In your template:

```html
<img [src]="base64Image" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```

Here, `[src]="base64Image"` is used instead of `src="{{base64Image}}"` to bind the sanitized URL to the image source. This is because the former is property binding, which binds an input property to a DOM property, while the latter is interpolation, which is used to incorporate calculated strings into the text between HTML element tags and within attribute assignments. 

In this case, we want to bind the sanitized URL to the `src` property of the `img` element, so we use property binding.
