I wanted to build a timer application in `React` using `functional component` and below are the requirements.
The component will display a number initialized to `0` know as `counter`.
The component will display a `Start` button below the `counter` number.
On clicking the `Start` button the counter will start running. This means the `counter` number will start incrementing by 1 for every one second.
When the counter is running(incrementing), the `Start` button will become the `Pause` button.
On clicking the `Pause` button, the `counter` will preserve its value (number) but stops running(incrementing).
The component will also display a `Reset` button.
On clicking the `Reset` button, the `counter` will go to its initial value(which is `0` in our case) and stops running(incrementing).
Below is the code that I have implemented, but `clearInterval` doesn't seems to be working, Also how do i implement Reset Button?
Code:
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [flag, setFlag] = useState(false);
  const [isClicked, setClicked] = useState(false);
  var myInterval;

  function incrementCounter() {
    setClicked(!isClicked);
    if (flag) {
      myInterval = setInterval(
        () => setCounter((counter) => counter + 1),
        1000
      );
      setFlag(false);
    } else {
      console.log("sasdsad");
      clearInterval(myInterval);
    }
  }

  function resetCounter() {
    clearInterval(myInterval);
    setCounter(0);
  }

  useEffect(() => {
    setFlag(true);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={incrementCounter}>
        {isClicked ? "Pause" : "Start"}
      </button>
      <button onClick={resetCounter}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

The issue you're facing is due to the scope of the `myInterval` variable. It's not preserving its value between renders, so when you're trying to clear the interval, it's not the same interval that was set in the previous render.

To fix this, you can use `useRef` hook to store the interval id. This will preserve the value across renders. Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
  const intervalRef = useRef();

  function startCounter() {
    setIsRunning(true);
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => setCounter((counter) => counter + 1), 1000);
  }

  function pauseCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }

  function resetCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    setCounter(0);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={isRunning ? pauseCounter : startCounter}>
        {isRunning ? "Pause" : "Start"}
      </button>
      <button onClick={resetCounter}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, `intervalRef` is a mutable object which holds the interval id. `startCounter` and `pauseCounter` functions are used to start and pause the counter respectively. `isRunning` state is used to track whether the counter is running or not. This state is also used to decide which function (`startCounter` or `pauseCounter`) to call when the button is clicked.

The problem with your code is that the `myInterval` variable is not preserving its value between renders. This is because every time your component re-renders, a new `myInterval` variable is created. So when you call `clearInterval(myInterval)`, it's not clearing the interval you think it is.

To solve this, you can use the `useRef` hook to store the interval ID. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object with a `.current` property that you can change without causing a re-render.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
  const intervalRef = useRef();

  function startCounter() {
    setIsRunning(true);
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => setCounter((counter) => counter + 1), 1000);
  }

  function pauseCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }

  function resetCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    setCounter(0);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={isRunning ? pauseCounter : startCounter}>
        {isRunning ? "Pause" : "Start"}
      </button>
      <button onClick={resetCounter}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, I've made the following changes:

1. I've added the `useRef` hook and created a `intervalRef` variable to store the interval ID.
2. I've split your `incrementCounter` function into two separate functions: `startCounter` and `pauseCounter`. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. I've updated the `onClick` handler for the start/pause button to call `startCounter` or `pauseCounter` depending on whether the counter is currently running.
4. I've updated the `resetCounter` function to clear the interval using `intervalRef.current`.
5. I've removed the `flag` state variable and the `useEffect` hook because they are no longer needed.

The problem with your code is that `myInterval` is not persisting its value between renders. This is because every time your component re-renders, a new instance of `myInterval` is created. So, when you call `clearInterval(myInterval)`, it is not clearing the interval you think it is.

To solve this, you can use `useRef` hook to create a mutable ref object where `.current` property is initialized to the passed argument (`null` in this case). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component.

Here is the corrected code:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
  const intervalRef = useRef(null);

  function startCounter() {
    setIsRunning(true);
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(
      () => setCounter((counter) => counter + 1),
      1000
    );
  }

  function pauseCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }

  function resetCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    setCounter(0);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={isRunning ? pauseCounter : startCounter}>
        {isRunning ? "Pause" : "Start"}
      </button>
      <button onClick={resetCounter}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, I've used `useRef` to create a `intervalRef` that holds the interval ID. This ref is then used in the `startCounter`, `pauseCounter` and `resetCounter` functions to start, pause and reset the counter respectively. I've also replaced `flag` and `isClicked` states with a single `isRunning` state that indicates whether the counter is currently running or not. This state is used to determine which function to call and what label to display on the start/pause button.
