I'm working on a `Vue + typescript` project. I want to use `process.env.var_name` to adjust the project is in development mode or production mode, just like
```
const isProduct = process.env.APP_ENV === "prod";
```

; however I got an error below. I never meet this error before, so could any one give me a clue why this would happen so I can try to figure out what happend in the project and then fix it.[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VEk1H.png)

The error message you're seeing is because TypeScript is unable to find a declaration for `process.env`. This is because `process.env` is a Node.js global variable, and TypeScript does not include Node.js type definitions by default.

To fix this issue, you need to install the Node.js type definitions. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

After you've installed the type definitions, you should be able to use `process.env` without any issues.

However, if you're using Vue CLI, you should note that all environment variables that start with `VUE_APP_` will be automatically loaded into your Vue application. So, you could use `process.env.VUE_APP_APP_ENV` instead of `process.env.APP_ENV`.

Also, remember to define your environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project. For example:

```
VUE_APP_APP_ENV=prod
```

And then in your code, you can access this variable like this:

```typescript
const isProduct = process.env.VUE_APP_APP_ENV === "prod";
```

This way, you are following the Vue CLI's convention for environment variables, and you don't need to worry about the TypeScript error.

The error message you're seeing is a TypeScript error. TypeScript is complaining because it doesn't know the type of `process.env.APP_ENV`. TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means it needs to know the types of all variables at compile time. 

In this case, `process.env.APP_ENV` is a Node.js environment variable, and TypeScript doesn't know what type it is. 

To fix this error, you need to tell TypeScript what type `process.env.APP_ENV` is. You can do this by declaring a global interface for `process.env` and adding `APP_ENV` as a property. Here's an example:

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv {
      APP_ENV: string;
    }
  }
}
```

This tells TypeScript that `process.env.APP_ENV` is a string. Now you should be able to use `process.env.APP_ENV` without any TypeScript errors.

Remember to place this declaration in a `.d.ts` file (like `typings.d.ts` or `env.d.ts`) in your project, so TypeScript can pick it up during the compilation process. 

Also, make sure that you have set the `APP_ENV` variable in your environment. You can do this in your `.env` file or in your deployment settings, depending on how your project is set up.

The error message you're seeing is a TypeScript error. TypeScript is complaining because it doesn't know what `process.env.APP_ENV` is. TypeScript is a statically typed language, so it needs to know the types of all objects at compile time.

In Node.js, `process.env` is an object that exposes environment variables as properties. However, TypeScript doesn't know this by default. You can solve this issue by declaring the type of `process.env` or the specific environment variable you're trying to access.

Here are a few ways to solve this:

1. **Declare the type of `process.env` globally:**

You can add a declaration for `process.env` in a `.d.ts` file in your project:

```typescript
declare namespace NodeJS {
  export interface ProcessEnv {
    APP_ENV: string;
    // define other variables here as necessary
  }
}
```

2. **Declare the type of `APP_ENV` locally:**

If you only need to use `APP_ENV` in one place, you can declare its type locally:

```typescript
const isProduct = (process.env as any).APP_ENV === "prod";
```

3. **Use a type assertion:**

You can also use a type assertion to tell TypeScript that `process.env.APP_ENV` is a string:

```typescript
const isProduct = (<any>process.env).APP_ENV === "prod";
```

Remember to set the environment variable `APP_ENV` in your production or development environment. If you're using Node.js, you can do this in your `package.json` scripts:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "APP_ENV=prod node server.js",
  "dev": "APP_ENV=dev node server.js"
}
```

Or you can use a package like `dotenv` to load environment variables from a `.env` file.
