I have a collaborative chat application that uses [tiptap](https://www.tiptap.dev/) for it's messaging area. I found it useful as it can support multiple formats already and can add some flexibility. However, I found myself stuck when looking for an event listener that listens for "enter" key. When the user hit the enter, I want to submit their chat and clear the editor.
I found this  event listener but I couldn't find exactly the place where it detects what key is pressed.
Sample code is below:
```
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });

  editor.on("update", e => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

I'm using Vue2, btw.
Thanks

You can add an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view. Here's an example code snippet that listens for the "Enter" key and submits the chat message:

```
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });

  editor.on("update", e => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  editor.view.dom.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key === "Enter" && !event.shiftKey) {
      event.preventDefault(); // prevent default behavior of adding a new line
      const message = this.editor.getHTML();
      // submit the message and clear the editor
      // ...
    }
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we add an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view. We check if the pressed key is the "Enter" key and if the shift key is not pressed (to allow for multiline messages). If the conditions are met, we prevent the default behavior of adding a new line and get the message from the editor. You can then submit the message and clear the editor as needed.

You can add an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view. Here's an example code snippet that listens for the "Enter" key press and emits an event to submit the chat and clear the editor:

```
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });

  editor.on("update", e => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  editor.view.dom.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key === "Enter") {
      event.preventDefault(); // prevent default behavior of adding a new line
      this.$emit("submitChat", this.editor.getHTML());
      this.editor.commands.setContent("");
    }
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

In this code, we added an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view. When the "Enter" key is pressed, we prevent the default behavior of adding a new line, emit an event to submit the chat with the current HTML content of the editor, and then clear the editor's content using the `setContent` command. 

Note that we also added a new event called "submitChat" that you can use to handle the submission of the chat outside of this component. You can listen for this event in the parent component and handle the submission logic there.

You can add an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view element to detect when the enter key is pressed. Here's an example code snippet that should work for you:

```
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });

  editor.on("update", e => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  editor.view.dom.addEventListener("keydown", event => {
    if (event.key === "Enter") {
      // Submit chat and clear editor
      console.log("Enter key pressed");
      // Add your code here to submit the chat and clear the editor
    }
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

This code adds an event listener for the "keydown" event on the editor's view element. When the event is fired, it checks if the key pressed was the enter key. If it was, you can add your code to submit the chat and clear the editor.
