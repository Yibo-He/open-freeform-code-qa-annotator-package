I have a custom modal component. When it's open, there is no scrolling whatsoever in the background.

I tried this code below:

```
componentDidMount() {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'unset';
}
```


Which seems to work at first, but when I use the modal component, in another page, there is no scroll even when the modal is closed.

Is there a better solution for this?

My modal component:

```
export class Modal extends React.Component {

constructor(props) {
    super(props);
}

componentDidMount() {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
}

componentWillUnmount() {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'unset';
}

render() {
    return (
        <React.Fragment>
            {this.props.showAt ?
                this.props.show ?
                    <div style={style} className={`${this.props.sectionName} ${modalTypeStyle ? modalTypeStyle : styles.modalWhite} ${modalTypeSize ? modalTypeSize : styles.modalSmall} ${!this.props.showAt ? styles.modalWhiteFixed : ""}`}>
                        {this.props.arrowShape ? <div className={arrowTypeStyle ? arrowTypeStyle : styles.triangleToprightWhite} /> : null}
                        {this.props.children}
                    </div>
                    : null
                :
                this.props.show ?
                    <div className={`${this.props.className} ${styles.modal}`}>
                        <div style={style} className={`${this.props.sectionName} ${modalTypeStyle ? modalTypeStyle : styles.modalWhite} ${modalTypeSize ? modalTypeSize : styles.modalSmall} ${!this.props.showAt ? styles.modalWhiteFixed : ""}`}>
                            {this.props.arrowShape ? <div className={arrowTypeStyle ? arrowTypeStyle : styles.triangleToprightWhite} /> : null}
                            {this.props.children}
                        </div>
                    </div> :
                    null}
        </React.Fragment>
    )
  }
}
```

The issue you're facing is likely due to the lifecycle methods `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount` being called at different times than you expect. When a component is unmounted, it doesn't necessarily mean that the modal is closed. The component could be unmounted for various reasons, such as a parent component re-rendering, causing all child components to unmount and remount.

A better approach would be to use the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method to check if the `show` prop has changed. If it has, you can then adjust the body overflow accordingly.

Here's how you could modify your code:

```jsx
export class Modal extends React.Component {

  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (prevProps.show !== this.props.show) {
      document.body.style.overflow = this.props.show ? 'hidden' : 'unset';
    }
  }

  render() {
    // your render code
  }
}
```

In this code, `componentDidUpdate` is called whenever the props or state of the component changes. We're checking if the `show` prop has changed, and if it has, we're setting the body overflow to 'hidden' if the modal is shown, and 'unset' if it's not.

This should ensure that the body overflow is set correctly based on whether the modal is currently shown or not.

The issue you are experiencing might be due to the fact that the `componentWillUnmount` method is not being called when you expect it to be. This could happen if the modal component is not actually being unmounted when it is closed, but just hidden. If this is the case, the `componentWillUnmount` method will not be called and the overflow style will not be reset.

Instead of using `componentDidMount` and `componentWillUnmount`, you could use `componentDidUpdate` to check if the `show` prop has changed and then set the overflow style accordingly. Here is how you could do it:

```jsx
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (this.props.show !== prevProps.show) {
        document.body.style.overflow = this.props.show ? 'hidden' : 'unset';
    }
}
```

This way, whenever the `show` prop changes, the overflow style of the body will be updated. When the modal is shown, the overflow will be set to 'hidden' and when it is hidden, the overflow will be set to 'unset'. This should ensure that the overflow style is always correct, regardless of whether the modal component is actually unmounted or not.

The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that the `componentWillUnmount` method is not being called when you expect it to be. This can happen if the modal component is not being unmounted from the DOM when it's closed, but rather just being hidden. 

A better approach would be to use the `componentDidUpdate` lifecycle method to check for changes in the `show` prop. If the modal is being opened, you can set the body overflow to 'hidden', and if it's being closed, you can set it back to 'auto' or 'scroll'. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (this.props.show && !prevProps.show) {
        // The modal is being opened
        document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    } else if (!this.props.show && prevProps.show) {
        // The modal is being closed
        document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
    }
}
```

This way, you're ensuring that the body overflow is being set correctly based on the current state of the modal, regardless of whether the modal component is being unmounted or not. 

Also, remember to set the initial body overflow style in the `componentDidMount` method if the modal is initially shown:

```jsx
componentDidMount() {
    if (this.props.show) {
        document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    }
}
```

And reset it in `componentWillUnmount` just in case:

```jsx
componentWillUnmount() {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'auto';
}
```

This should solve your issue.
