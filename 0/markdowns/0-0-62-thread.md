I'm building a clone of HackerNews and am getting the following error:

```
vue.esm.js?efeb:591 [Vue warn]: Avoid using non-primitive value as key, use string/number value instead.

found in

---> <Single> at src/components/Single.vue
       <App> at src/App.vue
         <Root>
```


The error seems to be coming from Single.vue but I can't work what it is? The template is as follows:

```
<template>
    <div class="container">
        <h2>{{ story.title }}</h2>
        <p>Score: {{ story.score }}</p>
        <p>{{ story.url }}</p>
        <div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">
          <div class="comment-wrap">
                <div class="comment-block">
                    <p class="comment-text">{{ comment.text }}</p>
                    <div class="bottom-comment">
                        <div class="comment-author">{{ comment.by }}</div>
                        <div class="comment-date">{{ comment.time }}</div>
                    </div>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
</template>
```


If anyone out there can help, that would be great!?

You can simply avoid the use of `:key` in your `v-for`.
```
...
<div v-for="comment in comments">
...
```

As vuejs [documentation](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#key) said:
> It is recommended to provide a key with v-for whenever possible, unless the
iterated DOM content is simple, or you are intentionally relying on the
default behavior for performance gains.

Other answers work, but the following is also worth a try:

```
<div v-for="(comment, idx) in comments" :key="idx">
  <!-- ... -->
</div>
```

The warning sources from `<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">`, where the object `comment` is used as a `key` for `v-for`. The meaning of the warning is quite literal, don't use Object as key.

Use unique primitive value as key, maybe something like `comment.id` or `${comment.time}${comment.by}`

Use unique primitive value as key,
It is recommended to provide a `key` attribute with `v-for` whenever possible.
> like `:key="design.uniqueId"`
```
<li v-for="design in designs" :key="design.id">
    <!-- code -->
</li>

<li v-for="loop in loops" :key="loop.id">
    <!-- code -->
</li>
```

Such as [Vue.js Documentation](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Maintaining-State)

as per vue js [Maintaining State](https://v2.vuejs.org/v2/guide/list.html#Maintaining-State) Doc it says your id is find multiple times
That means your code should look like this
`div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">`
insted of
`div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">`
To give Vue a hint so that it can track each nodeâ€™s identity, and thus reuse and reorder existing elements, you need to provide a unique key attribute for each item

Maybe you are using an Object type as the key, if it can be converted into a unique string, use the string instead of the instance by calling such as `toString`.
I had same issue when I used `mongoose.Types.ObjectId()` as the key, after I changed to `mongoose.Types.ObjectId().toHexString()` the warning disappear.
