Let's say I have a `div` in the DOM with `'200px'` of width and a `class` of `'target'`.
In order to test its width with cypress, I should write the code below:
```
cy.get('.target').should('have.css', 'width', '200px');
```

and there's a bunch of tests, testing widths and heights of elements...
...
Today something weird happened!
All these tests have failed because the value of `width` that cypress found was `200.0000000000032038879956012px` instead of `200px` !!!
The first solution that came into my mind was to test them on the actual numbers (ex, `200`), instead of the string (ex, `'200px'`) that the cypress found; which I think is an expensive idea!

Yes, you're correct. The issue you're facing is due to floating point precision error. JavaScript (and many other languages) use a binary floating point representation which can sometimes result in these tiny rounding errors.

You can solve this issue by parsing the width value to an integer before comparing it. This way, you're only comparing the whole number part of the width, and ignoring the decimal part.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
cy.get('.target').then(($el) => {
  const width = parseInt($el.css('width'), 10);
  expect(width).to.eq(200);
});
```

In this code, `$el.css('width')` gets the width of the element as a string, `parseInt` converts it to an integer, and then `expect` is used to check that the width is equal to 200.

This way, you're not comparing the exact string values, but the actual numeric values, which should be more reliable and less prone to these kinds of precision errors.

Yes, you're right. Testing on actual numbers instead of the string that Cypress found could be expensive and might not be the best approach. This issue is likely due to floating point precision in JavaScript, which can sometimes lead to unexpected results.

A better approach would be to parse the returned width to a fixed number of decimal places before comparing it. This way, you can avoid the precision issue. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
cy.get('.target').then(($el) => {
  const width = parseFloat($el.css('width'));
  expect(width).to.be.closeTo(200, 1); // The second parameter is the precision
});
```

In this code, we're using the `parseFloat` function to convert the width to a floating point number. Then, we're using the `expect` function's `closeTo` method to check if the width is close to 200 within a precision of 1.

This way, even if the width is `200.0000000000032038879956012px`, the test will still pass because it's close enough to `200px`.

The issue you're encountering is due to the way JavaScript handles floating point numbers. It's a common problem in many programming languages, not just JavaScript.

Instead of testing for an exact match, you could test to see if the width is within a certain range. This will allow for some slight variation in the actual value due to the way JavaScript handles floating point numbers.

Here's how you could do it:

```javascript
cy.get('.target').then(($el) => {
  const width = parseFloat($el.css('width'));
  expect(width).to.be.closeTo(200, 1); // 1px tolerance
});
```

In this code, we're using the `closeTo` assertion from Chai (the assertion library used by Cypress) to check if the width is within 1px of 200. This should be enough to handle any slight variations in the actual width due to floating point precision issues.

This approach should be more efficient than converting the widths to numbers for each test, and it will also make your tests more robust and less likely to fail due to minor differences in the actual and expected values.
