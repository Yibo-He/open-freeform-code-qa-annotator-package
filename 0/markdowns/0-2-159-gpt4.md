I am wondering how to insert an image inside of a div element in HTML. I have tried inserting an image through  and through  inside of a div element, but none of those have worked for me and I am not sure how to get it to work. I am wondering how to get my image inserted inside of the div element, so my program will actually display it. The problem is that my image never displays and my solutions did not work for me. Here is the simple and full code: [https://jsfiddle.net/mxafg1vu/](https://jsfiddle.net/mxafg1vu/)
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

</head>
<body>

<div class="header">
<div id ="header">
<h2 style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: Helvetica; color: blue;">Holograms</h2>
</div></div><br>


<div class="row">
  <div class="leftcolumn">
   <div class="card">
    <div id="title">
      <h2>Holograms In The Future?</h2>
      <h5>November 24th, 2021.</h5>

      <!-- <div class="hologram.jpg" style="height:200px; width: 200px"></div> -->
       <!--Img src -->
      <img src="hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>

      <p>Text </p>
      <p>Text </p>
    </div>

    </div>

<div class="footer">

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The code you have written for inserting an image is correct. The problem might be with the path of the image you are trying to display. 

```html
<img src="hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>
```
In the `src` attribute, you have given the name of the image file as `hologram.jpg`. This means that the HTML file is looking for this image in the same directory where the HTML file is located. If the image is not in the same directory, you need to provide the correct path to the image file.

Here are some examples:

- If your image is in a subfolder named `images`, the `src` would be `src="images/hologram.jpg"`
- If your image is in the parent directory of your HTML file, the `src` would be `src="../hologram.jpg"`

Also, make sure that the image file name and extension are correct. File names are case-sensitive, so `hologram.jpg` is different from `Hologram.jpg` or `hologram.JPG`.

If the image is hosted online, you can use the direct URL to the image file in the `src` attribute.

```html
<img src="https://example.com/path/to/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>
```

If none of these solutions work, the problem might be with the image file itself. Try opening it with an image viewer to make sure it's not corrupted.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The problem you're experiencing might be due to the path of the image you're trying to display. The `src` attribute in the `img` tag is used to specify the path of the image. If the image is in the same directory as your HTML file, you can just put the image name with its extension (like you did). But if it's in another directory, you need to specify the path correctly.

Here are some examples:

- If your image is in a subdirectory, you would use something like this: `src="images/hologram.jpg"`
- If your image is in a parent directory, you would use something like this: `src="../hologram.jpg"`

So, in your case, you should check the path of your image. If it's not in the same directory as your HTML file, you need to adjust the `src` attribute accordingly.

Also, make sure that the image file actually exists and the name is spelled correctly, including the file extension. File names are case-sensitive on some systems, so `hologram.jpg` is different from `Hologram.jpg`.

Lastly, ensure that the image is in a format that the browser can display. Most browsers can display JPEG, PNG, and GIF images. If your image is in a different format, you might need to convert it to a format the browser can handle.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The code you've provided seems to be correct for displaying an image in a div element. The `<img>` tag is the correct way to insert an image in HTML. However, there could be a few reasons why your image is not displaying:

1. **Incorrect Path:** The `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag specifies the path to the image. If the image is not in the same directory as your HTML file, you need to specify the correct path. For example, if your image is in a folder named "images", you would use `<img src="images/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500">`.

2. **Incorrect Filename or Extension:** Ensure that the filename and its extension in your `src` attribute exactly match the name and extension of your image file. Filenames are case-sensitive, so "hologram.jpg" is different from "Hologram.jpg" or "hologram.JPG".

3. **Image File Doesn't Exist:** Make sure the image file actually exists in the specified path.

4. **Browser Cache:** Sometimes, the browser cache can cause issues. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page.

5. **Broken Image:** The image file itself could be broken or corrupted. Try opening the image file directly in your browser to see if it displays.

6. **Server Issues:** If your HTML file is hosted on a server, there could be server issues preventing the image from being loaded. Check your server's error logs for any issues.

If you've checked all of these and the image still doesn't display, there could be an issue with your CSS or JavaScript that's preventing the image from being displayed. You would need to check your CSS and JavaScript code for any issues.
