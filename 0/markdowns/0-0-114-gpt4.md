`Flipper` is a platform for debugging iOS, Android and React Native apps.
I have downloaded the `Flipper` app from [https://fbflipper.com/](https://fbflipper.com/), but I can't run it.

The issue you're facing might be due to the security settings on your Mac. MacOS Catalina has increased security settings that prevent applications from unidentified developers or sources from being run.

Here are the steps to resolve this issue:

1. Open `System Preferences` on your Mac.
2. Go to `Security & Privacy`.
3. Click on the `General` tab.
4. At the bottom of the window, you should see a message like "`Flipper` was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."
5. Click on the `Open Anyway` button next to this message.
6. A dialog box will pop up, asking if you're sure. Click `Open`.

If you don't see the `Open Anyway` button, make sure you're logged in as an administrator. If you're still having trouble, you may need to click the lock icon in the bottom left corner of the `Security & Privacy` window to make changes.

After these steps, you should be able to run `Flipper` on your Mac.

If the problem persists, please let me know so I can assist you further.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to the security settings on your Mac. MacOS Catalina has increased security measures, and one of them includes blocking applications from unidentified developers or from the internet.

Here's how you can open the application:

1. Go to your `Applications` folder and find `Flipper`.
2. Control-click the `Flipper` icon, then choose `Open` from the menu.
3. Click `Open` in the dialog box. If you don't see this option, choose `Apple menu > System Preferences`, click `Security & Privacy`, then click `General`. Under the `General` tab, click `Open Anyway` to confirm your intent to open or install the app.

The warning prompt reappears, and you can click `Open`.

The app is saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it, just like a registered app.

If the problem persists, it might be a different issue. Please provide more details about the error message you're getting.
