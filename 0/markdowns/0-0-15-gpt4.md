I have an API class that I am trying to use in a React app.
```
// API file

class API {
...
}

export default API;

// Other file
import API from "utils/API";

const api = new API();
```

And I am getting the error:
```
TypeError: _API.default is not a constructor
```

But.. it seems like my default is set?
My Jest setup is like this:
```
"jest": {
    "setupFiles": [
      "./jestSetupFile.js"
    ],
    "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
    "preset": "jest-expo",
    "transformIgnorePatterns": [
      "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-svg|react-router-native/.*|@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/.*)"
    ]
  },
```

My  guess is that this is due to a configuration of my babel, webpack or package.json.
What could be causing this?
Note, I want to be clear, this doesn't happen whatsoever in my main application,  in Jest testing

---


If I change it to a named export/import, I get this:
```
TypeError: _API.API is not a constructor
```

 confusing behavior.

The error message you're seeing usually indicates that the module you're trying to import is not exporting what you think it's exporting. In this case, it seems like `API` is not being recognized as a class.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your class definition**: Make sure that your `API` class is defined correctly and that it can be instantiated. You can try to log the `API` object in your test file to see what it actually is.

2. **Check your import/export statements**: Make sure that you're exporting and importing the `API` class correctly. If you're using named exports, you should import the class like this: `import { API } from "utils/API";`.

3. **Check your mock files**: If you're using Jest and you have mock files for your modules, make sure that they're correctly mocking the `API` class. If you're mocking the `API` module, you should return a constructor function from your mock file.

4. **Check your Jest configuration**: Make sure that your Jest configuration is correct and that it's not causing any issues with your modules. You can try to create a minimal Jest configuration to see if the problem persists.

5. **Check your Babel configuration**: If you're using Babel, make sure that your Babel configuration is correct and that it's not causing any issues with your modules. You can try to create a minimal Babel configuration to see if the problem persists.

6. **Check your Webpack configuration**: If you're using Webpack, make sure that your Webpack configuration is correct and that it's not causing any issues with your modules. You can try to create a minimal Webpack configuration to see if the problem persists.

Without seeing your actual code and configuration, it's hard to say what exactly is causing the issue. But these are some common things you can check when you're seeing this kind of error.

The error message you're seeing usually means that the thing you're trying to use as a constructor is not a class or function. In your case, it seems like the `API` class is not being exported or imported correctly.

Here are a few things you could check:

1. **File Path**: Make sure the file path in the import statement is correct. If the `API` file is not in the same directory as the file where you're trying to use it, you'll need to adjust the path accordingly.

2. **Class Definition**: Check the `API` class definition. Make sure it's a class and it has a constructor. If it's an empty class with no constructor, you might get this error.

3. **Mocking**: If you're mocking the `API` class in your tests, make sure the mock is correctly set up. If Jest replaces the `API` class with a mock that's not a constructor, you'll get this error.

4. **Transpilation**: Babel might be transpiling the `API` class into something that's not a constructor. Check your Babel configuration and make sure it's set up to handle ES6 classes correctly.

5. **Named vs Default Exports**: If you're using named exports, you'll need to import the `API` class like this: `import { API } from 'utils/API';`. If you're using default exports, you'll need to import it like this: `import API from 'utils/API';`. Make sure you're using the correct syntax for the type of export you're using.

If none of these suggestions solve the problem, it would be helpful to see the actual code of the `API` class and the code where you're trying to use it.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is usually caused by trying to instantiate a non-class as a class. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The API class is not being exported correctly.
2. The API class is not being imported correctly.
3. The API class is not a class at all.

Given that you've tried both default and named exports and imports, it seems like the issue might be with the API class itself or how it's being transpiled.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the API class**: Make sure that the API class is actually a class and that it's being defined correctly. If it's not a class, you won't be able to instantiate it with `new`.

2. **Check the transpilation process**: If you're using Babel or another transpiler, make sure that it's correctly transpiling your code. You can try to log the API class in your test file to see what it looks like after being transpiled.

3. **Mock the API class in Jest**: If the issue is only happening in Jest and not in your main application, it might be due to how Jest is handling the import. You can try to mock the API class in Jest to see if that resolves the issue.

4. **Check the Jest configuration**: Make sure that your Jest configuration is correct. If you're using `jest-expo`, make sure that it's compatible with your version of Expo and that it's correctly set up.

5. **Check the import path**: Make sure that the path in your import statement is correct. If the path is incorrect, the import will fail and you won't be able to instantiate the API class.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about the API class and how it's being used and I'll be happy to help further.
