Generally new to web design and watching some tutorials on creating some backend for a project, getting really tired of writing out the  manually, I see youtubers do .classname and then the class with the div appears, but for some reason it isn't working for me? Any help would be appreciated.

Also, would it be easier to switch to Sublime, my buddies think that it is the way to go.

Cheers.

It sounds like you're referring to a feature called "Emmet" which is a plugin for many text editors that helps you write HTML and CSS faster. You can write shorthand code like `.classname` and Emmet will automatically expand it to `<div class="classname"></div>` when you press tab.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that you don't have Emmet installed or enabled in your text editor. You didn't mention which text editor you're currently using, but you can usually find Emmet in the plugin or extension marketplace for your editor.

As for switching to Sublime, it's a popular text editor and many developers find it very efficient and user-friendly. However, whether it's "better" or "easier" than your current editor depends on your personal preferences and needs. Sublime, Atom, and Visual Studio Code are all solid choices with similar features, so you might want to try them out and see which one you like best. They all support Emmet, so you'll be able to use the `.classname` shortcut in any of them once you have Emmet installed and enabled.

The feature you're referring to is called "Emmet" which is a plugin for many popular text editors that helps you write HTML and CSS code quickly using abbreviations. For example, typing `.classname` and then pressing `Tab` will automatically expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that either your text editor doesn't support Emmet, or it's not enabled. You didn't mention which text editor you're currently using, but most modern ones like Visual Studio Code, Atom, and Sublime Text all support Emmet.

As for whether you should switch to Sublime, it really depends on your personal preference. Sublime is a very powerful and fast text editor with a lot of features and plugins, including Emmet. However, other text editors like Visual Studio Code and Atom also have similar features and might be easier to use for beginners. 

I would recommend trying out a few different text editors to see which one you like best. It's also worth noting that the text editor is just a tool, and it's more important to understand the underlying concepts of web design and development. 

If you're using Visual Studio Code, Emmet is built-in and should work out of the box. If it's not working, you might want to check your settings or see if there's a conflict with another extension. If you're using a different text editor, you might need to install Emmet as a plugin. 

Here's how you can do it in some popular text editors:

- **Sublime Text**: Go to `Preferences > Package Control > Install Package`, then search for `Emmet` and install it.
- **Atom**: Go to `Atom > Preferences > Install`, then search for `emmet` and install it.

After installing Emmet, you should be able to use the `.classname` shortcut to quickly create divs with a class.

The feature you're referring to is called "Emmet" which is a web development tool for faster HTML and CSS coding. It works based on abbreviations that expand to valid HTML tags. For example, if you type `.classname` and press `Tab`, it should expand to `<div class="classname"></div>`.

If this isn't working for you, it's possible that the text editor you're using doesn't support Emmet, or you haven't installed or enabled it. Emmet is built-in in many popular text editors like VS Code, Sublime Text, Atom, and Brackets. If you're using one of these, make sure you have the latest version and that Emmet is enabled in the settings.

As for switching to Sublime, it's a matter of personal preference. Sublime Text is a very popular text editor due to its speed, functionality, and customization options. However, other text editors like VS Code or Atom also offer great features and might be more user-friendly for beginners. I would recommend trying out different text editors and see which one you like best. They all have their strengths and weaknesses, and the best one for you depends on your personal needs and preferences.
