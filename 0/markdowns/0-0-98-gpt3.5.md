I need to display  of my react app in the footer in  format.

I need this version to increment every time I deploy the app by being provided a choice if I want to increment  or  or .

How do I achieve this? :)

To display the version of your React app in the footer in the format you mentioned, you can create a version file in your project's root directory and add the version number to it. Then, you can import this file into your React component and display the version number in the footer.

To increment the version number every time you deploy the app, you can use a build tool like Webpack or Gulp to automate the process. You can create a script that prompts you to choose whether to increment the major, minor, or patch version number and then updates the version file accordingly.

Here's an example script using Node.js and the `inquirer` package to prompt the user for the version increment type:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const inquirer = require('inquirer');

// Read the current version from the version file
const version = fs.readFileSync('./version.txt', 'utf8').trim();

// Prompt the user for the version increment type
inquirer.prompt([
  {
    type: 'list',
    name: 'incrementType',
    message: 'Choose the version increment type:',
    choices: ['major', 'minor', 'patch']
  }
]).then(answers => {
  // Increment the version number based on the user's choice
  const [major, minor, patch] = version.split('.');
  let newVersion;
  switch (answers.incrementType) {
    case 'major':
      newVersion = `${Number(major) + 1}.0.0`;
      break;
    case 'minor':
      newVersion = `${major}.${Number(minor) + 1}.0`;
      break;
    case 'patch':
      newVersion = `${major}.${minor}.${Number(patch) + 1}`;
      break;
  }

  // Write the new version to the version file
  fs.writeFileSync('./version.txt', newVersion);

  console.log(`Version updated to ${newVersion}`);
});
```

You can then add this script to your build process to automatically update the version number before deploying your app.

To display the version of your React app in the footer in the format you specified, you can create a version file in your project's root directory and store the version number in it. Then, you can read the version number from the file and display it in the footer of your app.

To increment the version number every time you deploy the app, you can create a script that prompts you for the type of increment you want to make (major, minor, or patch) and then updates the version number in the version file accordingly.

Here are the steps you can follow to achieve this:

1. Create a version file in your project's root directory. You can name it `version.txt` or any other name you prefer.

2. In the version file, store the version number in the format `major.minor.patch`. For example, if your app's current version is 1.2.3, the version file should contain the text `1.2.3`.

3. In your React app, create a component for the footer and import the version number from the version file. You can use the `fs` module in Node.js to read the version file. Here's an example:

```
import React from 'react';
import fs from 'fs';

const version = fs.readFileSync('version.txt', 'utf-8').trim();

function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      Version {version}
    </footer>
  );
}

export default Footer;
```

4. Create a script in your `package.json` file that updates the version number in the version file. Here's an example:

```
"scripts": {
  "version": "node scripts/version.js"
}
```

5. Create a `version.js` file in a `scripts` directory in your project's root directory. In this file, write code that prompts you for the type of increment you want to make and updates the version number in the version file accordingly. Here's an example:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');

const versionFile = 'version.txt';

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

fs.readFile(versionFile, 'utf-8', (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    process.exit(1);
  }

  const [major, minor, patch] = data.trim().split('.');

  rl.question('Which version number do you want to increment? (major/minor/patch) ', answer => {
    let newMajor = major;
    let newMinor = minor;
    let newPatch = patch;

    switch (answer) {
      case 'major':
        newMajor = parseInt(major) + 1;
        newMinor = 0;
        newPatch = 0;
        break;
      case 'minor':
        newMinor = parseInt(minor) + 1;
        newPatch = 0;
        break;
      case 'patch':
        newPatch = parseInt(patch) + 1;
        break;
      default:
        console.error('Invalid answer');
        process.exit(1);
    }

    const newVersion = `${newMajor}.${newMinor}.${newPatch}`;

    fs.writeFile(versionFile, newVersion, err => {
      if (err) {
        console.error(err);
        process.exit(1);
      }

      console.log(`Version updated to ${newVersion}`);
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
});
```

6. Run the script by running `npm run version` in your terminal. The script will prompt you for the type of increment you want to make and update the version number in the version file accordingly.

7. Finally, make sure to commit the updated version file to your version control system (e.g. Git) after running the script. This will ensure that the version number is incremented every time you deploy the app.

To display the version of your React app in the footer in the format you specified, you can create a version file in your project's root directory and store the version number in it. Then, you can import the version number into your React component and display it in the footer.

To increment the version number every time you deploy the app, you can use a build tool like Webpack or Gulp to automate the process. You can create a script that prompts you to choose whether to increment the major, minor, or patch version number and then updates the version file accordingly.

Here's an example of how you can achieve this using Node.js and the `readline` module:

1. Create a version file in your project's root directory:

```
// version.js
module.exports = '1.0.0';
```

2. Import the version number into your React component and display it in the footer:

```
import React from 'react';
import version from './version';

function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer>
      <p>Version {version}</p>
    </footer>
  );
}

export default Footer;
```

3. Create a script to update the version file:

```
// update-version.js
const fs = require('fs');
const readline = require('readline');

const versionFile = './version.js';

const rl = readline.createInterface({
  input: process.stdin,
  output: process.stdout
});

rl.question('Which version number do you want to increment? (major/minor/patch) ', (answer) => {
  const version = require(versionFile);
  const [major, minor, patch] = version.split('.');

  switch (answer) {
    case 'major':
      fs.writeFileSync(versionFile, `module.exports = '${Number(major) + 1}.0.0';`);
      break;
    case 'minor':
      fs.writeFileSync(versionFile, `module.exports = '${major}.${Number(minor) + 1}.0';`);
      break;
    case 'patch':
      fs.writeFileSync(versionFile, `module.exports = '${major}.${minor}.${Number(patch) + 1}';`);
      break;
    default:
      console.log('Invalid choice');
  }

  rl.close();
});
```

4. Add a `postbuild` script to your `package.json` file to run the `update-version.js` script after each deployment:

```
// package.json
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "react-scripts start",
    "build": "react-scripts build",
    "test": "react-scripts test",
    "eject": "react-scripts eject",
    "postbuild": "node update-version.js"
  }
}
```

Now, every time you run `npm run build`, the `postbuild` script will prompt you to choose which version number to increment and update the version file accordingly. The new version number will be displayed in the footer of your React app.
