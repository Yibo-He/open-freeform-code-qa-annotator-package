I'm learning both Jest and Cypress at same time. I know that they are not direct competitors because Cypress is focused on E2E and Jest on unit testing. For now I have implemented in my project both Jest and Cypress with few tests.
But actually most things I can test in both Cypress and Jest, and often I have hard time to decide with what write my test. Also it is harder to maintain compared to single test library.
I'm wondering - how often is Cypress (or alternative) and Jest (or alternative) used together? Is it really standard and good practice to use both? Or most developers/teams sticks with single one solution and it is fine?
: It was a long time since this question was asked. I got compromise that was also suggested in comment. Instead using only Cypress or Cypress + Jest, I'm using Cypress + new Cypress Component Testing (so no Jest). Thanks to that I'm having same library and assertions (easier to manage) but can test both e2e and components.

The use of Jest and Cypress together is not uncommon, especially in larger projects where different types of testing are required. Jest is often used for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. This combination allows for comprehensive testing coverage.

However, it's important to note that the choice of testing tools often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the development team. Some teams might prefer to use a single tool to keep their testing environment simpler, while others might prefer to use multiple tools to take advantage of the unique features each tool offers.

In your case, using Cypress for both end-to-end and component testing seems like a good compromise. This approach allows you to maintain consistency in your testing environment while still being able to test different aspects of your application.

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure the quality and reliability of your application. The tools you use to achieve this goal can vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's always a good idea to evaluate different tools and choose the ones that best fit your project's needs.

It's not uncommon for developers to use both Jest and Cypress in the same project, as they serve different purposes. Jest is primarily used for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. 

Unit tests with Jest help to ensure that individual components of your application work as expected in isolation. These tests are typically quick to run and can be used to test a wide variety of scenarios, including edge cases that might be difficult to replicate in a full end-to-end test.

On the other hand, Cypress tests help to ensure that your application works as expected when all of its components are working together. These tests simulate real user interactions, so they can catch issues that unit tests might miss, such as problems with the way components interact with each other or with backend services.

While there is some overlap in what these tools can do, they each have their strengths and are typically used together to provide a comprehensive testing strategy.

However, maintaining two testing frameworks can indeed be more complex and time-consuming than just using one. If you find that this is the case for you, you might consider focusing on one tool that best fits your needs.

Your decision to use Cypress Component Testing is a good one, as it allows you to leverage the strengths of Cypress for both end-to-end and component testing, simplifying your testing strategy and reducing the overhead of maintaining multiple testing frameworks.

In conclusion, whether to use both Jest and Cypress, or just one of them, depends on your specific needs and circumstances. Both approaches can be effective, and the best choice depends on factors like the complexity of your application, the skills and preferences of your team, and the time and resources you have available for testing.

It's not uncommon for developers to use both Jest and Cypress in the same project, as they serve different purposes and can complement each other well. Jest is primarily used for unit testing and snapshot testing, while Cypress is used for end-to-end testing. 

However, it's also true that maintaining tests in two different libraries can be more complex and time-consuming. The decision to use both should be based on the specific needs of your project. If your application has a lot of complex interactions that need to be tested in a real browser environment, then Cypress would be a good choice. On the other hand, if your application is more focused on logic and data manipulation, then Jest's unit testing capabilities would be more beneficial.

The new Cypress Component Testing feature you mentioned is a great solution as it allows you to test both components and end-to-end scenarios using the same library, which simplifies maintenance and learning curve.

In conclusion, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to this question. It depends on the specific needs of your project and your personal preference. It's always a good idea to experiment with different tools and see which one works best for you.
