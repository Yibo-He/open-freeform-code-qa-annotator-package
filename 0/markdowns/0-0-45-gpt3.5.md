I'm making a chess game and I am using Vue 3 and TypeScript with Pinia for the state management.
I want to do something like the following:
```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: undefined
    }
  },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})
```

UpdateGameState.vue
```
setup() {
    const store = useStore()
    const previousPieceSelected: Piece | undefined = store.previousPieceSelected;
    let playerTurn: PieceColor = store.playerTurn;

    const initialGameState: GameState = {
      boardState: store.gameBoard,
      playerTurn,
    };

    const updateGameState = (
      cellRow: number,
      cellCol: number,
      currentPiece: Piece
    ) => {
      if (
        previousPieceSelected === undefined ||
        previousPieceSelected.pieceType === PieceType.None
      ) {
        store.updatePreviousPieceSelected(currentPiece);
      }
      if (
        (previousPieceSelected !== currentPiece && (currentPiece.pieceType === PieceType.None || currentPiece.color !== previousPieceSelected.color)) 
      ) {
        MovePiece(store.gameBoard, previousPieceSelected, {row: cellRow, col: cellCol} as Position)
        store.updatePreviousPieceSelected(undefined);
        store.changePlayer();
      }
    };
```

However, I get that an error on the following line:
```
store.updatePreviousPieceSelected(currentPiece);
```

That currentPiece (of type Piece) is not assignable to type undefined. I found a hack to get this to work by doing the following in my store:
```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: getInitialPreviousPieceSelected()
    }
  },
  actions: {
    changePlayer() {
      this.playerTurn =
          this.playerTurn === PieceColor.White
            ? PieceColor.Black
            : PieceColor.White;
    },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})

function getInitialPreviousPieceSelected(): Piece | undefined {
  return undefined;
}
```

But it feels kluge. Is there another way to type previousPieceSelected in the initial state return?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, there is another way to type `previousPieceSelected` in the initial state return. You can use a union type to allow it to be either `Piece` or `undefined`. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: undefined as Piece | undefined
    }
  },
  actions: {
    changePlayer() {
      this.playerTurn =
          this.playerTurn === PieceColor.White
            ? PieceColor.Black
            : PieceColor.White;
    },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})
```

By using `undefined as Piece | undefined`, you are telling TypeScript that `previousPieceSelected` can be either `Piece` or `undefined`. This way, you won't get the error you were seeing before.

Yes, there is a better way to type `previousPieceSelected` in the initial state return. You can use a union type to allow it to be either a `Piece` or `undefined`. Here's how you can update your code:

```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: undefined as Piece | undefined
    }
  },
  actions: {
    changePlayer() {
      this.playerTurn =
          this.playerTurn === PieceColor.White
            ? PieceColor.Black
            : PieceColor.White;
    },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})
```

By using `undefined as Piece | undefined`, you are telling TypeScript that `previousPieceSelected` can be either a `Piece` or `undefined`. This way, you won't get the error you were seeing before.

Yes, there is a better way to type `previousPieceSelected` in the initial state return. You can use a union type to allow it to be either `Piece` or `undefined`. Here's how you can update your code:

```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: undefined as Piece | undefined
    }
  },
  actions: {
    changePlayer() {
      this.playerTurn =
          this.playerTurn === PieceColor.White
            ? PieceColor.Black
            : PieceColor.White;
    },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})
```

By using `undefined as Piece | undefined`, you are telling TypeScript that `previousPieceSelected` can be either `Piece` or `undefined`. This way, you can avoid the hack you were using earlier.
