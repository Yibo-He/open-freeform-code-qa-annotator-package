Is there any way to change background color dynamically on scroll?

For example, refer this site([https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/](https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/))

When you first access that site, background color is blue.

While scroll down, it's color change to black smoothly.

Also see this site(`codepen.io/Funsella/pen/yLfAG/`)

Second site is same with first. But it's color changed at once.

But first site's color is not change at once.

It changed gradually related to scroll position.

```
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
.section1 {
  background-color: white;
  height: 100%;
}
.section2 {
  background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654);
  height: 100%;
}
```
```
<html>
<body>
  <section class="section1">
    SECTION1
  </section>
  <section class="section2">
    SECTION2
  </section>
</body>
</html>
```



Above code is what I'm worked on.

Current it's color is split by each section.

When I scroll down, I want to change color `background-color: white` -> `background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654)`

Is there any solution about this?

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript and CSS. Here's an example code snippet that you can use as a starting point:

```
// Get the elements that you want to change the background color of
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1');
const section2 = document.querySelector('.section2');

// Listen for the scroll event on the window
window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  // Calculate the percentage of the page that has been scrolled
  const scrollPercentage = (window.scrollY / (document.body.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight)) * 100;

  // Set the background color of the sections based on the scroll percentage
  section1.style.backgroundColor = `rgba(255, 255, 255, ${1 - (scrollPercentage / 100)})`;
  section2.style.background = `linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654 ${scrollPercentage}%, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0) ${scrollPercentage}%)`;
});
```

In this code, we first get the elements that we want to change the background color of (`section1` and `section2`). Then, we listen for the scroll event on the window and calculate the percentage of the page that has been scrolled. We use this percentage to set the background color of the sections dynamically using CSS.

For `section1`, we set the background color to white with an alpha value that decreases as the user scrolls down the page. For `section2`, we set the background to a linear gradient that starts with the colors `#f05fa6` and `#ed1654` and ends with transparent white. The position of the transparent white color in the gradient is determined by the scroll percentage.

You can adjust the colors and positions in the gradient to achieve the effect that you want.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript and CSS. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to change the background color of the body element based on the scroll position:

```
const body = document.querySelector('body');
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1');
const section2 = document.querySelector('.section2');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const scrollPosition = window.scrollY;
  const section2Position = section2.offsetTop;

  if (scrollPosition >= section2Position) {
    body.classList.add('gradient-bg');
  } else {
    body.classList.remove('gradient-bg');
  }
});
```

In this code, we're listening for the `scroll` event on the window object. When the user scrolls, we get the current scroll position using `window.scrollY`. We also get the offset top position of the second section using `section2.offsetTop`.

If the scroll position is greater than or equal to the offset top position of the second section, we add a CSS class to the body element called `gradient-bg`. This class applies a CSS gradient background to the body element.

Here's the CSS code for the `gradient-bg` class:

```
.gradient-bg {
  background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654);
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease-in-out;
}
```

This CSS code applies a linear gradient background to the body element and adds a transition effect to the background color property. This transition effect makes the background color change smoothly over time.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Yes, you can achieve this effect using JavaScript and CSS. Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to change the background color of the body element based on the scroll position:

```
const body = document.querySelector('body');
const section1 = document.querySelector('.section1');
const section2 = document.querySelector('.section2');

window.addEventListener('scroll', () => {
  const scrollPosition = window.scrollY;
  const section2Position = section2.offsetTop;

  if (scrollPosition >= section2Position) {
    body.classList.add('gradient-background');
  } else {
    body.classList.remove('gradient-background');
  }
});
```

In this code, we're listening for the `scroll` event on the window object. When the user scrolls, we get the current scroll position using `window.scrollY`. We also get the offset top position of the second section using `section2.offsetTop`.

If the scroll position is greater than or equal to the offset top position of the second section, we add a CSS class to the body element that applies the gradient background. Otherwise, we remove the class.

Here's the CSS code that applies the gradient background:

```
body {
  transition: background-color 0.5s ease;
  background-color: white;
}

.gradient-background {
  background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654);
}
```

We're using the `transition` property to animate the background color change over 0.5 seconds. The initial background color is white, and the gradient background is applied when the `gradient-background` class is added to the body element.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
