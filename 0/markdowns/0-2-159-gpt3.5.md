I am wondering how to insert an image inside of a div element in HTML. I have tried inserting an image through  and through  inside of a div element, but none of those have worked for me and I am not sure how to get it to work. I am wondering how to get my image inserted inside of the div element, so my program will actually display it. The problem is that my image never displays and my solutions did not work for me. Here is the simple and full code: [https://jsfiddle.net/mxafg1vu/](https://jsfiddle.net/mxafg1vu/)
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">

</head>
<body>

<div class="header">
<div id ="header">
<h2 style="text-indent: 1em; font-family: Helvetica; color: blue;">Holograms</h2>
</div></div><br>


<div class="row">
  <div class="leftcolumn">
   <div class="card">
    <div id="title">
      <h2>Holograms In The Future?</h2>
      <h5>November 24th, 2021.</h5>

      <!-- <div class="hologram.jpg" style="height:200px; width: 200px"></div> -->
       <!--Img src -->
      <img src="hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>

      <p>Text </p>
      <p>Text </p>
    </div>
    </div> 
    </div>
    </div>

<div class="footer">
  <div id="footer">
 </div>

</body>
</html>
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Your code looks fine, but make sure that the image file "hologram.jpg" is in the same directory as your HTML file. If the image file is in a different directory, you need to specify the correct path to the image file. 

Also, make sure that the image file name and extension are correct. If the file name or extension is incorrect, the image will not display.

If the issue persists, try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page. Sometimes, the browser cache can cause images not to display properly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Your code looks fine, and the image tag should work to display the image. However, there are a few things you can check to make sure the image is being loaded correctly:

1. Make sure the image file name and extension are correct. In your code, you have used "hologram.jpg" as the image source. Check that the file name and extension match the actual file name and extension of the image you want to display.

2. Check the file path of the image. If the image file is not in the same folder as your HTML file, you need to specify the correct file path in the "src" attribute of the image tag. For example, if your image file is in a folder called "images" that is located in the same directory as your HTML file, you would use the following code:

```
<img src="images/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500">
```

3. Check that the image file is not corrupted or damaged. Try opening the image file separately to make sure it can be opened and viewed correctly.

If none of these solutions work, try using a different image file to see if the problem is with the file itself.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Your code looks fine, and the issue might be with the image file path. Make sure that the image file is in the same directory as your HTML file, and the file name and extension are correct. Also, check if the image file name is spelled correctly in your HTML code.

If the image file is in a different directory, you need to specify the correct file path in the `src` attribute of the `img` tag. For example, if the image file is in a folder named "images" in the same directory as your HTML file, you can use the following code:

```
<img src="images/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500">
```

If the issue persists, you can try opening the image file separately in your browser to check if it's displaying correctly. If it's not, then the issue might be with the image file itself.
