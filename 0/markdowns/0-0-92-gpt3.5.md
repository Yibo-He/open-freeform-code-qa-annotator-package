I have encountered an error when using the latest version of Webpack (5.1.0). It looks like the configuration is throwing an error because the validation schema is too restrictive. Here is my webpack configuration file in a gist, and the error message I am seeing.

[https://gist.github.com/adarshbhat/3ec5950b66b78102da0cf46e51a3d633](https://gist.github.com/adarshbhat/3ec5950b66b78102da0cf46e51a3d633)

```
[webpack-cli] 
Invalid configuration object. Webpack has been initialized using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
 - configuration.node should be one of these:
   false | object { __dirname?, __filename?, global? }
   -> Include polyfills or mocks for various node stuff.
   Details:
    * configuration.node has an unknown property 'module'. These properties are valid:
      object { __dirname?, __filename?, global? }
      -> Options object for node compatibility features.
    * configuration.node has an unknown property 'net'. These properties are valid:
      object { __dirname?, __filename?, global? }
      -> Options object for node compatibility features.
    * configuration.node has an unknown property 'fs'. These properties are valid:
      object { __dirname?, __filename?, global? }
      -> Options object for node compatibility features.

```

I am attempting to use a parser generator library (antlr4) that works both in a Node.js environment, as well as in browsers. It looks like the library code is requiring global objects like fs, and if it is empty, assumes that it is in a browser environment. According to the [documentation of Antlr4](https://github.com/antlr/antlr4/blob/master/doc/javascript-target.md) and [that of Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/node/) , this is a supported configuration file. But it is not working. Please help.

Antlr JavaScript documentation has now been updated with the new configuration for Webpack 5

It looks like the issue is with the `node` configuration in your webpack configuration file. The error message indicates that the `node` configuration object has unknown properties such as `module`, `net`, and `fs`. 

In Webpack 5, the `node` configuration object has been updated to be more restrictive. It now only allows the properties `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `global`. 

To fix this issue, you can update your `node` configuration to only include these properties. Here's an updated version of your webpack configuration file with the `node` configuration updated:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
  node: {
    __dirname: false,
    __filename: false,
    global: true,
  },
};
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing and allow you to use the `antlr4` library with Webpack 5.

It looks like the issue is with the `node` configuration in your webpack configuration file. The error message indicates that the `node` configuration object has unknown properties `module`, `net`, and `fs`. 

In Webpack 5, the `node` configuration object has been updated to be more restrictive. It now only allows certain properties, such as `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `global`. 

To fix this issue, you can update your `node` configuration to only include these properties. Here's an updated version of your webpack configuration file with the `node` configuration updated:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.g4$/,
        use: 'antlr4-webpack-loader',
      },
    ],
  },
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      antlr4$: path.resolve(__dirname, 'node_modules/antlr4/index.js'),
    },
  },
  node: {
    __dirname: false,
    __filename: false,
    global: true,
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: path.join(__dirname, 'dist'),
    compress: true,
    port: 9000,
  },
};
```

This should resolve the issue with the `node` configuration and allow you to use the `antlr4-webpack-loader` with Webpack 5.

It looks like the issue is with the `node` configuration in your webpack configuration file. The error message indicates that the `node` configuration object has unknown properties `module`, `net`, and `fs`. 

In Webpack 5, the `node` configuration object has been updated to be more restrictive. It now only accepts the properties `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `global`. 

To fix this issue, you can remove the `node` configuration object from your webpack configuration file, or update it to only include the valid properties. Here's an updated version of your webpack configuration file with the `node` configuration object removed:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
};
```

This should resolve the issue you're seeing with the webpack configuration. Let me know if you have any other questions or issues!
