With the update `react native` to version `0.63`, new components have appeared. Can someone more experienced explain how the `Pressable` differs from the `TouchableOpacity` and when it is better to use them.

`Pressable` is a new core component introduced in React Native 0.63. It is designed to handle various states of press interactions in a more unified and extendable way, compared to the older components like `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, etc.

Here are some key differences between `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity`:

1. **State Handling**: `Pressable` provides more control over the press states (pressed, not pressed) with its `pressed` state. This allows you to change the style or behavior of the component based on the press state. `TouchableOpacity` does not have this feature.

2. **Hover and Focus States**: `Pressable` also supports hover and focus states, which are useful for platforms like web, TV, etc. `TouchableOpacity` does not support these states.

3. **Child Function**: `Pressable` can take a function as its child that receives a boolean indicating whether the component is currently pressed. This is not possible with `TouchableOpacity`.

4. **Hit Slop**: Both `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity` support hit slop, but `Pressable` allows you to specify different hit slop values for different sides (left, right, top, bottom, vertical, horizontal).

5. **Ripple Effect**: `Pressable` supports ripple effect on Android, which is not available in `TouchableOpacity`.

6. **Delay Events**: Both components support delay events (`delayLongPress`, `delayPressIn`, `delayPressOut`), but `Pressable` also supports `android_disableSound`, `android_ripple`, and `unstable_pressDelay`.

When to use `Pressable` over `TouchableOpacity`?

- When you need more control over the press states.
- When you need to support hover and focus states.
- When you need to use a function as a child that receives the press state.
- When you need to specify different hit slop values for different sides.
- When you want to use the ripple effect on Android.

In general, `Pressable` is more flexible and powerful than `TouchableOpacity`, and it is recommended to use `Pressable` for new projects. However, if you have an existing project that uses `TouchableOpacity` and it meets all your needs, there is no urgent need to switch to `Pressable`.

`Pressable` is a new core component introduced in React Native 0.63. It is a more flexible, extensible alternative to the existing touchable components like `TouchableOpacity`, `TouchableHighlight`, etc.

Here are some differences between `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity`:

1. **Event Handling**: `Pressable` provides more event handlers than `TouchableOpacity`. It includes `onPress`, `onLongPress`, `onPressIn`, `onPressOut`, and `onPressMove`. This gives you more control over the press events.

2. **Styling**: `Pressable` introduces a new way to handle styles. It accepts a function as its `style` prop, which receives an object indicating whether the component is currently pressed. This allows you to change styles based on the press state. `TouchableOpacity` doesn't have this feature.

3. **Hover, Focus, Blur Events**: `Pressable` also supports `onHoverIn`, `onHoverOut`, `onFocus`, `onBlur` events which are not available in `TouchableOpacity`.

4. **Hit Slop**: Both `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity` support hit slop, but `Pressable` allows you to specify different values for each side (top, bottom, left, right), while `TouchableOpacity` applies the same value to all sides.

5. **Ripple Effect**: `Pressable` supports ripple effect on Android, which is not available in `TouchableOpacity`.

When to use them:

- Use `TouchableOpacity` when you need a simple button with an opacity effect on press, and you don't need to handle many different press events.

- Use `Pressable` when you need more control over the press events, want to change styles based on the press state, or need to support hover, focus, blur events. It's also a good choice when you want to create a button with a ripple effect on Android.

In general, `Pressable` is more flexible and powerful, and it's likely to replace the existing touchable components in the future. However, `TouchableOpacity` is simpler and easier to use, so it might be a better choice for simple use cases.

`Pressable` is a new core component introduced in React Native 0.63. It is designed to handle various states of press interactions in a more unified and extendable way. 

Here are some key differences between `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity`:

1. **State Control**: `Pressable` gives you more control over the component's visual feedback on different states of interaction like press in, press out, long press, etc. You can change the style of the component based on these states. This is something `TouchableOpacity` doesn't provide.

2. **Hit Slop**: Both `Pressable` and `TouchableOpacity` support hit slop, but `Pressable` provides more flexibility by allowing you to specify different hit slop values for different sides (top, left, bottom, right).

3. **Long Press**: `Pressable` provides a separate `onLongPress` event, which is not available in `TouchableOpacity`.

4. **Children as Function**: `Pressable` allows you to use a function as children. The function receives a boolean indicating whether the component is currently pressed. This is a powerful feature that allows you to customize the component's appearance based on its press state.

5. **Hover, Focus, Pressed States**: `Pressable` can handle hover, focus, and pressed states, which is useful for platforms like web, desktop, and TV platforms. `TouchableOpacity` does not have this feature.

When to use them:

- Use `TouchableOpacity` when you need a simple button with an opacity effect on press and don't need to control different interaction states. It's simpler and has been around for a long time, so it's well-tested and widely used.

- Use `Pressable` when you need more control over the component's visual feedback on different interaction states, or when you're targeting platforms like web, desktop, and TV. It's more flexible and powerful, but also more complex and newer, so it might have some issues that haven't been discovered yet.
