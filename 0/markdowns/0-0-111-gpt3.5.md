I'm trying to update Angular in my project from version 10.2 to 11.0.
Running ng update:
```
@angular-devkit/build-angular      0.1002.0 -> 0.1100.1     ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular
  @angular/cdk                       10.2.7 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/cdk
  @angular/cli                       10.2.0 -> 11.0.1         ng update @angular/cli
  @angular/core                      10.2.3 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/core
  @angular/material                  10.2.7 -> 11.0.0         ng update @angular/material
```

Unfortunately each package I tried to update fails. I tried with --force and --allowDirty flags.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like you are facing dependency conflicts while updating your Angular project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running the following command:
```
npm cache clean --force
```

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

3. Install the latest version of `@angular/cli` globally by running the following command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

4. Install the packages in the following order:
```
npm install @angular/compiler-cli@11.0.0
npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
npm install @angular/core@11.0.0
npm install @angular/cdk@11.0.0
npm install @angular/material@11.0.0
```

5. If you still face dependency conflicts, try updating the conflicting packages individually by running the following commands:
```
ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular
ng update @angular/cdk
ng update @angular/material
```

6. If the issue persists, try updating to a lower version of Angular and then updating to the desired version.

7. If none of the above steps work, you can try creating a new Angular project with the desired version and copying over your code and dependencies.

I hope these steps help you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like there are conflicting dependencies in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache.
3. Update your `npm` version by running `npm install -g npm`.
4. Install the latest version of `@angular/cli` globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
5. Install the dependencies in the correct order:

```
npm install @angular/compiler-cli@11.0.0
npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
npm install @angular/cdk@11.0.0
npm install @angular/core@11.0.0
npm install @angular/material@11.0.0
npm install
```

6. If the issue persists, try running `npm audit fix --force` to force the installation of the latest compatible versions of the dependencies.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like there are conflicting dependencies between the packages you are trying to update. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies again.
4. Try updating the packages one by one in a specific order:

   a. `@angular/cli`
   
   b. `@angular/core`
   
   c. `@angular-devkit/build-angular`
   
   d. `@angular/cdk`
   
   e. `@angular/material`

   You can use the following commands to update each package:
   
   ```
   ng update @angular/cli@11.0.1
   ng update @angular/core@11.0.0
   ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
   ng update @angular/cdk@11.0.0
   ng update @angular/material@11.0.0
   ```
   
5. If you still encounter errors, try running `npm audit fix --force` to force npm to install the latest compatible versions of the packages.

If none of these steps work, you may need to manually update the conflicting dependencies in your `package.json` file to resolve the issue.
