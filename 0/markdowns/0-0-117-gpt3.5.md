I quick question!
I have a webapp that only fetches data from an API so i dont have i backend part. My question is where do you keep your API key? Accordingly to React docs you should not store API keys in the app so how do you manage this when you have an webapp that consumes an API and you have to use the API key in your get requests?

Great question! It's important to keep API keys secure to prevent unauthorized access to your API. One common approach is to store the API key on the server-side and make requests to the API from the server. This way, the API key is not exposed to the client-side code.

However, since you mentioned that you don't have a backend part, another approach is to use environment variables. You can create a `.env` file in your project's root directory and store the API key as an environment variable. Then, you can access the environment variable in your client-side code using `process.env.API_KEY`.

Note that this approach is not completely secure as the API key is still visible in the client-side code. However, it's better than hardcoding the API key in your code. Additionally, you can use tools like webpack or create-react-app to obfuscate your code and make it harder for someone to find the API key.

Another option is to use a service like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to create a serverless backend that can handle API requests and store the API key securely. This approach requires more setup but provides a more secure solution.

Overall, it's important to consider the security implications of storing API keys and choose an approach that best fits your needs.

Great question! It's important to keep API keys secure to prevent unauthorized access to your API. One way to handle this is to store the API key on the server-side and make requests to the API through a backend server. This way, the API key is not exposed to the client-side code. 

If you don't have a backend server, you can use environment variables to store the API key on the client-side. This way, the API key is not hard-coded in your code and is not visible in your code repository. You can use a package like dotenv to manage environment variables in your React app. 

Another option is to use a service like AWS Secrets Manager or Google Cloud Secret Manager to securely store and manage your API keys. These services allow you to store and retrieve secrets securely, and you can access them from your code using the appropriate SDK. 

In any case, it's important to keep your API keys secure and not expose them in your code or in public repositories.

Great question! It's true that you should not store API keys in your React app, as they can be easily accessed by anyone who inspects your code. Instead, you can store your API key on your server-side code and make requests to the API from there. 

One way to do this is to create a simple backend server using a server-side language like Node.js or Python. You can then make requests to the API from your backend server and send the data back to your React app. This way, your API key is kept secure on the server-side code and is not exposed to the client-side code.

Another option is to use environment variables to store your API key. You can set up environment variables on your server or in a separate configuration file, and then reference them in your code. This way, your API key is not hard-coded into your code and is kept secure.

Overall, the key is to keep your API key secure and not expose it in your client-side code. By using a backend server or environment variables, you can ensure that your API key is kept safe.
