I have a form in one of my React components, and and in the outside component that calls it I want to pass a reference to a button there, so that I can also submit that using that button.

To make it more clear I have the following:

```
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class CustomForm extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={alert('Form submitted!')}>
        <button type='submit'>Inside Custom</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <CustomForm />
      <button>In Root</button>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```


Now, I can submit the form using the button titled 'Inside Custom', but I also want to be able to submit the form using the button titled 'In Root' that is located in the root component. Is there a way to somehow pass reference from that button to that custom component, and actually submit the form when `In Root` button is clicked?

Yes, you can achieve this by using refs in React. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired functionality:

```
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class CustomForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert('Form submitted!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <button type='submit'>Inside Custom</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

class App extends Component {
  customFormRef = React.createRef();

  handleSubmit = () => {
    this.customFormRef.current.handleSubmit();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <CustomForm ref={this.customFormRef} />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>In Root</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In the `CustomForm` component, we have defined a `handleSubmit` method that prevents the default form submission behavior and shows an alert message.

In the `App` component, we have created a `customFormRef` using `React.createRef()`. We have also defined a `handleSubmit` method that calls the `handleSubmit` method of the `CustomForm` component using the `customFormRef`.

We have passed the `customFormRef` to the `CustomForm` component using the `ref` prop. Finally, we have added an `onClick` event handler to the 'In Root' button that calls the `handleSubmit` method of the `App` component.

Now, when you click the 'In Root' button, it will call the `handleSubmit` method of the `App` component, which in turn will call the `handleSubmit` method of the `CustomForm` component, resulting in the form submission.

Yes, you can achieve this by using refs in React. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to achieve this:

```
import React, { Component } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

class CustomForm extends Component {
  handleSubmit = () => {
    alert('Form submitted!');
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <button type='submit'>Inside Custom</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}

class App extends Component {
  customFormRef = React.createRef();

  handleSubmit = () => {
    this.customFormRef.current.handleSubmit();
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <CustomForm ref={this.customFormRef} />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>In Root</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In this modified code, we have created a ref using `React.createRef()` in the `App` component and passed it to the `CustomForm` component using the `ref` prop. We have also added a `handleSubmit` method in the `CustomForm` component that will be called when the form is submitted.

In the `App` component, we have added a `handleSubmit` method that will be called when the 'In Root' button is clicked. This method calls the `handleSubmit` method of the `CustomForm` component using the ref.

Now, when you click the 'In Root' button, the form will be submitted just like it would when you click the 'Inside Custom' button.

      </form>
    );
  }
}

class App extends Component {
  customFormRef = React.createRef();

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    this.customFormRef.current.handleSubmit(event);
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <CustomForm ref={this.customFormRef} />
        <button onClick={this.handleSubmit}>In Root</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

In this modified code, we have added a `handleSubmit` method to the `CustomForm` component, which prevents the default form submission behavior and shows an alert message.

In the `App` component, we have created a `customFormRef` using `React.createRef()`. We have also added a `handleSubmit` method that prevents the default button behavior and calls the `handleSubmit` method of the `CustomForm` component using the `customFormRef`.

Finally, we have passed the `customFormRef` as a prop to the `CustomForm` component using the `ref` attribute. This allows us to access the `CustomForm` component's methods and properties from the `App` component.

Now, when you click the 'In Root' button, the `handleSubmit` method of the `App` component is called, which in turn calls the `handleSubmit` method of the `CustomForm` component, submitting the form and showing the alert message.
