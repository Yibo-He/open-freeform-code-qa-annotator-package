So I have nested navigators
Main BottomTab.Navigator
- - - - - - - - 
The problem is when I navigate from Profile View Screen to Following Navigator, I pass some parameters to the parent Following Navigator and I want all of those params in the children tabs Screens (Pages/Groups).
But the route of the children tab screens do not get the parameters which are passed to the parent navigator (Following Tab Navigator)
Is there a way to do that?
Here's my code:

```
const ProfileStack = () => (
  <Stack.Navigator
    initialRouteName='profileView'
  >
    <Stack.Screen
      name='profileView'
      component={ProfileScreen}
      options={{
        headerMode: 'screen',
        headerShown: false,
      }}
    />

    <Stack.Screen
      name='followers'
      component={FollowersScreen}
      options={{
        headerTitle: 'Followers',
      }}
    />
    <Stack.Screen
      name='following'
      component={FollowingTabs}
      options={{
        headerTitle: 'Following',
      }}
    />
 </Stack.Navigator>
```


```
const Tabs = createMaterialTopTabNavigator();
export const FollowingTabs = () => (
  <Tabs.Navigator
    initialRouteName='page'
    lazy
    swipeEnabled
  >
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={PageScreen}
      name='page'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '2 Pages' }}
    />
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={GroupScreen}
      name='groups'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '3 Groups' }}
    />
  </Tabs.Navigator>
);
```

From the profileView Screen I'm trying to navigate to the following Tabs Screen and need to pass some parameters as follows.
```
const onPressHandler = () => {
    navigation.navigate('following', **{ isPublicProfile, firstName }**);  // These parameters are passed to the route of the following Tabs Navigator
  };
```

And when I try to read these parameters in children tabs (Pages/Groups) these are undefined
```
const PageScreen = ({ route }) => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = route.params; // undefined?? Can't read parent's params
...
```

Any help would be appreciated.
Edit: I found this open Issue on GitHub ([https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/issues/43](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/issues/43)) Is this not possible yet?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Unfortunately, passing parameters from a parent navigator to a child navigator is not possible yet in React Navigation. The issue you found on GitHub is still open and unresolved. 

However, there are some workarounds you can try. One option is to use a state management library like Redux or Context API to pass the parameters between screens. Another option is to use a global variable to store the parameters and access them in the child screens. 

Here's an example of using a global variable:

```
// In the parent screen
const onPressHandler = () => {
  global.followingParams = { isPublicProfile, firstName };
  navigation.navigate('following');
};

// In the child screen
const PageScreen = () => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = global.followingParams;
  // Use the parameters here
  ...
};
```

Note that using a global variable is not recommended for larger applications as it can lead to maintenance issues and bugs. It's better to use a state management library or wait for the React Navigation team to implement a solution for passing parameters between navigators.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Unfortunately, passing parameters from a parent navigator to a child navigator is not currently supported in React Navigation. The issue you found on GitHub is still open and there is no official solution yet.

However, there are some workarounds you can try. One option is to use a state management library like Redux or Context API to store the parameters and access them in the child navigator screens. Another option is to pass the parameters down as props to the child navigator screens instead of using the `route.params` object.

Here's an example of passing parameters as props to the child navigator screens:

```
const FollowingTabs = ({ route }) => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = route.params;

  return (
    <Tabs.Navigator
      initialRouteName='page'
      lazy
      swipeEnabled
    >
      <Tabs.Screen
        component={() => <PageScreen isPublicProfile={isPublicProfile} firstName={firstName} />}
        name='page'
        options={{ tabBarLabel: '2 Pages' }}
      />
      <Tabs.Screen
        component={() => <GroupScreen isPublicProfile={isPublicProfile} firstName={firstName} />}
        name='groups'
        options={{ tabBarLabel: '3 Groups' }}
      />
    </Tabs.Navigator>
  );
};
```

Then in the child navigator screens, you can access the props directly:

```
const PageScreen = ({ isPublicProfile, firstName }) => {
  // use isPublicProfile and firstName here
  ...
};
```

I hope this helps!

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Unfortunately, passing parameters from a parent navigator to a child navigator is not currently supported in React Navigation. The issue you found on GitHub confirms this limitation.

However, there are some workarounds you can try:

1. Use a global state management library like Redux or MobX to store the parameters and access them from any screen in your app.

2. Pass the parameters as props to the screens in the child navigator instead of using the `route.params` object. You can do this by creating a custom component that wraps the child navigator and passes the props down to each screen.

Here's an example of how you can implement the second workaround:

```
const FollowingTabsWrapper = ({ isPublicProfile, firstName }) => (
  <Tabs.Navigator
    initialRouteName='page'
    lazy
    swipeEnabled
  >
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={() => <PageScreen isPublicProfile={isPublicProfile} firstName={firstName} />}
      name='page'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '2 Pages' }}
    />
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={() => <GroupScreen isPublicProfile={isPublicProfile} firstName={firstName} />}
      name='groups'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '3 Groups' }}
    />
  </Tabs.Navigator>
);

export const FollowingTabs = ({ route }) => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = route.params;

  return <FollowingTabsWrapper isPublicProfile={isPublicProfile} firstName={firstName} />;
};
```

In this example, we create a new component called `FollowingTabsWrapper` that wraps the child navigator and passes the `isPublicProfile` and `firstName` props down to each screen. We then render this component in the `FollowingTabs` screen and pass the parameters from the parent navigator as props to the wrapper component.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
