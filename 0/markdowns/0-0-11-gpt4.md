I have two utility methods - one for navigating to the parent node and one for reloading self. The first one works as supposed to, while the other one fails to cause the reload.

```
navigateToParent(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  this.router.navigate([".."], options);
}

navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const self = ".";
  this.router.navigate([self]);

  // const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  // this.router.navigate(["."], options);
}
```


I followed the answer [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/57157316/1525840), with the only exception that I'd like my path navigated to, to be generic, not hard-coded. I've tried passing different parameters, like  and  etc. Nothing seems to give me the desired reload.

What do I miss?

I also tried to pick the parts from the  passed into the service's method but I only see a bunch of observables, not the actual segments. And, of course,  only caused an error.

Googling produced a lot of hints with vastly varying suggestions (e.g. [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56715352/how-to-refresh-element-in-angular-8-without-page-reload)), which leads me to the suspicion that it might be heavily dependent on the version (I'm on 8.0) and, also, that many of the suggestions, although accepted, might be misleading and more harmful in the long run, without me realizing it.

The issue here is that you're not passing the `relativeTo` option in the `navigateToSelf` method. This option is necessary because it tells the router that the navigation should be relative to a specific route. Without this option, the router will treat the navigation as absolute, and it will not work as expected.

Here's how you can modify your `navigateToSelf` method:

```typescript
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const self = ".";
  const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  this.router.navigate([self], options);
}
```

This should make the `navigateToSelf` method work as expected. However, keep in mind that the `shouldReuseRoute` function will affect all navigations, not just this one. If you want to reset it to its default behavior after the navigation, you can do so by setting it back to its default implementation:

```typescript
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const self = ".";
  const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  this.router.navigate([self], options).then(() => {
    this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => true;
  });
}
```

This will ensure that the `shouldReuseRoute` function is reset to its default behavior after the navigation is complete.

In Angular, the router does not reload the current page by default if you navigate to the same route. This is a performance feature to prevent unnecessary operations. However, you can force a route (and its component) to reload by using a custom RouteReuseStrategy.

In your case, you are trying to navigate to the same route, but it seems like you are not providing the `relativeTo` option in the `navigateToSelf` method. This could be the reason why the page is not reloading.

Here is how you can modify your `navigateToSelf` method:

```typescript
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  this.router.navigate(['.'], options);
}
```

In this code, `relativeTo: route` tells the router to calculate the navigation path relative to the provided route.

Also, make sure that you reset the `shouldReuseRoute` function back to its original state after the navigation, to avoid affecting other navigations:

```typescript
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  const shouldReuseRoute = this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute;
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const options: NavigationExtras = { relativeTo: route };
  this.router.navigate(['.'], options).then(() => {
    this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = shouldReuseRoute;
  });
}
```

This way, the `shouldReuseRoute` function will be reset to its original state after the navigation is done, ensuring that other navigations are not affected.

In Angular, the router does not reload the current page by default if you navigate to the same route. This is because Angular is designed to be a Single Page Application (SPA) framework, and reloading the page goes against this design.

However, you can force Angular to reload the page by using a custom RouteReuseStrategy. Here is an example of how you can do this:

```typescript
import { ActivatedRouteSnapshot, DetachedRouteHandle, RouteReuseStrategy } from '@angular/router';

export class CustomReuseStrategy implements RouteReuseStrategy {
  shouldDetach(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return false;
  }

  store(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, detachedTree: DetachedRouteHandle): void {}

  shouldAttach(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return false;
  }

  retrieve(route: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): DetachedRouteHandle | null {
    return null;
  }

  shouldReuseRoute(future: ActivatedRouteSnapshot, curr: ActivatedRouteSnapshot): boolean {
    return future.routeConfig === curr.routeConfig && JSON.stringify(future.params) === JSON.stringify(curr.params);
  }
}
```

You can then provide this strategy in your application module:

```typescript
@NgModule({
  providers: [
    { provide: RouteReuseStrategy, useClass: CustomReuseStrategy }
  ]
})
export class AppModule { }
```

In your navigateToSelf method, you can then force a reload like this:

```typescript
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = 'reload';
  this.router.navigate([route.routeConfig.path], { relativeTo: route });
}
```

This should force Angular to reload the page when you navigate to the same route. However, please note that this is not the recommended way to handle this situation in Angular. Instead, you should try to handle changes in your component without needing to reload the entire page. For example, you can use Observables and the async pipe to automatically update your component when the underlying data changes.
