I'm stuck at `geolocation`. Actually it working fine but some problem appear when I using `If else`. When User click allow location it working but the problem appear when user click not allow, it not insert in `else`. This [DEMO](https://stackblitz.com/edit/angular-geolocation-blitz-yvyeyv) as reference.



```
ngOnInit() {
       this.getUserLocation();
    }

    getUserLocation() {
       if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
          });
    }else {
       console.log("User not allow")

    }
}
```

The issue is that `getCurrentPosition` is an asynchronous function, which means that the `else` block is executed before the user has a chance to allow or deny the geolocation request. To fix this, you can move the `else` block inside the `getCurrentPosition` callback function:

```
getUserLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
      this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
      this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
    }, error => {
      console.log("User denied geolocation request");
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
  }
}
```

In this updated code, if the user denies the geolocation request, the error callback function will be executed and the message "User denied geolocation request" will be logged to the console.

The issue is that `getCurrentPosition()` is an asynchronous function, which means that the code inside the `if` block will continue to execute while the browser is asking the user for permission to access their location. If the user denies permission, the code inside the `else` block will not be executed because it is outside of the `getCurrentPosition()` function.

To fix this, you can pass a second function as an argument to `getCurrentPosition()`. This function will be called if the user denies permission or if there is an error getting the location. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
ngOnInit() {
  this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
        this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
      },
      error => {
        console.log("Error getting location:", error);
      }
    );
  } else {
    console.log("Geolocation not supported by browser.");
  }
}
```

Now, if the user denies permission or there is an error getting the location, the code inside the second function will be executed.

The issue with your code is that the `else` block is not being executed because the `getCurrentPosition` method is an asynchronous function and the `if` block is being executed before the user has a chance to respond to the location permission prompt.

To fix this issue, you can pass a second function as a parameter to the `getCurrentPosition` method. This function will be executed if the user denies the location permission. Here's an updated code snippet:

```
ngOnInit() {
   this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
   if (navigator.geolocation) {
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
         position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
         },
         error => {
            console.log("User denied location permission");
         }
      );
   } else {
      console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
   }
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the location permission, the `error` function will be executed and the message "User denied location permission" will be logged to the console.
