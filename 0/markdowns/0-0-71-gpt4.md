I have custom type in `src/@types/app.d.ts` ( `export type AuthKeyT = string` )

I would like to use it in `tsx` react file (using `import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app'`), but I am getting an error:

> Cannot import type declaration files. Consider importing 'app' instead of '@types/app' 

So, when I use `import { AuthKeyT } from 'app'` I am getting:

> Cannot find module 'app'.

So.. what is wrong? How should I import custom type?

I am using typescript `3.7.2` in react app.

The issue you're facing is related to how TypeScript handles type declarations. The '@types' directory is a special directory that TypeScript uses to look for global type definitions. It's not meant to be used for importing types directly.

Instead, you should import your types from the file they are declared in. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, make sure your `tsconfig.json` file includes the `src` directory in the `include` array. If it doesn't, add it:

```json
{
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

2. Then, you can import your type using a relative path from the file you want to use it in. For example, if your `app.d.ts` file is in the `src/@types` directory and you want to use it in a file in the `src/components` directory, you would import it like this:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../@types/app';
```

Remember that the path should be relative to the file you're importing the type into, not the root of your project.

3. If you want to avoid relative paths, you can add a `baseUrl` and `paths` configuration to your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@types/*": ["@types/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Then, you can import your type like this:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app';
```

This tells TypeScript to look for modules starting with '@types/' in the 'src/@types' directory.

The issue here is that TypeScript is not able to resolve the path to your type definition file. TypeScript has a special handling for `@types/` directory which is used for declaration files of libraries that don't provide their own.

Here's how you can solve this:

1. First, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the `src` directory in the `include` array:

```json
{
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

2. Then, you can import your type using a relative path:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../@types/app';
```

The `../` part may vary depending on the structure of your project. Adjust it so that it points to the correct location of your `@types` directory.

3. If you want to avoid using relative paths, you can add a `paths` configuration in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@types/*": ["@types/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Then, you can import your type like this:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app';
```

This tells TypeScript to look for `@types` in the `src` directory.

The issue you're facing is related to how TypeScript handles type declaration files. TypeScript treats `.d.ts` files differently from regular `.ts` files. You cannot import types from a `.d.ts` file the same way you would from a `.ts` file.

To solve this issue, you should use TypeScript's triple-slash directive to reference the type declaration file. This directive will tell TypeScript to include your `app.d.ts` file in the compilation context.

Here's how you can do it:

1. At the top of your `.tsx` file, add the following line:

```tsx
/// <reference types="@types/app" />
```

2. Then you can use your `AuthKeyT` type in your `.tsx` file like this:

```tsx
let myVar: AuthKeyT;
```

Please note that the path in the `types` attribute should be relative to the `tsx` file.

Alternatively, you can include the type declaration file in your `tsconfig.json` file:

```json
{
  "include": [
    "src/@types/app.d.ts"
  ]
}
```

Then you can use your `AuthKeyT` type in your `.tsx` file without importing it.

If you still face issues, please ensure that your `tsconfig.json` file is set up correctly. Specifically, check the `typeRoots` and `types` options.
