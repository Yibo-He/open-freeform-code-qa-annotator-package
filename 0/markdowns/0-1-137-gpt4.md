I want to change bootstrap's default theme-colors with SASS , the problem is when I change a color and compile , it gives me invalid CSS value error.
I've read the docs and saw some tutorials on YouTube but I can't see where is the problem
I'm using bootstrap 5.1.0 , sass 3
this is my scss file:
```
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
"primary": //some color here,
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

and this is the error I get in terminal
```
PS F:\Coding\projects\sepehr\client\src\styles> sass style.scss custom.css
Error: ("primary": #0d6efd, "secondary": #6c757d, "success": #198754, "info": #0dcaf0, 
"warning": #ffc107, "danger": #dc3545, "light": #f8f9fa, "dark": #212529) isn't a valid 
CSS value.

   ╵
```

The error message you're seeing is because of the way you're trying to override the `$theme-colors` map in Bootstrap. 

You're importing the Bootstrap variables file before you declare your own `$theme-colors` map. This means that when the Bootstrap variables file is imported, it doesn't yet know about your `$theme-colors` map, so it uses the default one. Then, when you declare your `$theme-colors` map, it's too late because the Bootstrap variables have already been imported.

Instead, you should declare your `$theme-colors` map before importing the Bootstrap variables and main Bootstrap file. Here's how you can do it:

```scss
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

This way, when the Bootstrap variables file is imported, it will use your `$theme-colors` map instead of the default one.

Also, make sure that the color you're using is a valid CSS color. For example, you can use a hexadecimal color like `#ff0000` for red, or a named color like `blue`.
