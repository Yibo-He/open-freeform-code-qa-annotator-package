I am getting image as base64 blob from a service and I am binding into
view. But I am facing an issue. How can I sanitize the url into a
trusted url. I have tried with sanitizer but no luck..
Please help me out..

```
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{{inspectionDetails.reportImage}}" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```


```
this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.ImgUrl);
```

You can try using the `DomSanitizer` provided by Angular to sanitize the URL. Here's an example:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-image',
  template: `
    <img [src]="sanitizedImgUrl" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
  `
})
export class ImageComponent implements OnInit {
  ImgUrl: string;
  sanitizedImgUrl: any;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.ImgUrl = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.sanitizedImgUrl = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` method of `DomSanitizer` to sanitize the URL. We are also concatenating the `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix to the base64 image data before sanitizing it.

You can try using the `DomSanitizer` provided by Angular to sanitize the URL. Here's an example:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-image',
  template: `
    <img [src]="sanitizedImgUrl" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
  `,
})
export class ImageComponent implements OnInit {
  ImgUrl: string;
  sanitizedImgUrl: any;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.ImgUrl = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.sanitizedImgUrl = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In this example, we're using the `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` method to sanitize the URL. This method tells Angular that the URL is safe to use and prevents any security warnings or errors.

You can try using the `DomSanitizer` service to sanitize the URL. Here's an example:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-image',
  template: `
    <img [src]="sanitizedImgUrl" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
  `,
})
export class ImageComponent implements OnInit {
  ImgUrl: string;
  sanitizedImgUrl: any;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.ImgUrl = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.sanitizedImgUrl = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In this example, we're using the `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` method of the `DomSanitizer` service to sanitize the URL. This method tells Angular that the URL is safe to use, and prevents any security warnings or errors from being thrown.
