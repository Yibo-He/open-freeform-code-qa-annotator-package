How can I change default primary color for primeNG (saga-blue theme) ? changing --primary-color doesn't help, because in node_modules/..../theme.css elements are styled using the main color hex and not ' --primary-color '.
I also can't override styling for all elements that use that primary color because they are too many + they have different shades of --primary-color on hover and on focus, how can I handle this ?

PrimeNG uses the CSS variables for its theming which are defined in the theme.css file. However, if changing the `--primary-color` variable doesn't help, it's likely because the color is hardcoded in the CSS file.

Here's a workaround:

1. Create a new CSS file in your project (e.g., `custom-theme.css`).
2. In this file, override the color variables that PrimeNG uses. For example:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #yourColor;
    --primary-color-dark: #yourDarkerColor;
    --primary-color-light: #yourLighterColor;
    --primary-color-text: #yourContrastTextColor;
}
```

3. Import this file in your `styles.css` or `angular.json` file.

```css
@import 'custom-theme.css';
```

This should override the default colors of the theme. If you want to change the color for a specific component, you can do so by overriding the CSS for that component in your `custom-theme.css` file.

Remember that the color shades for hover and focus states are usually generated by darkening or lightening the primary color. You can use a color generator tool to get the darker and lighter shades of your primary color.

If this doesn't work, it might be because the styles are encapsulated and the view encapsulation needs to be set to `None` in the component where you want to apply the styles.

```typescript
import {ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  ...
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
```

This will make your styles global and they will affect other components as well. So, use this option carefully.

PrimeNG uses the CSS variables for its theming which makes it easier to customize the theme. However, if you're using a pre-built theme like saga-blue, the colors are already compiled into CSS and changing the CSS variable won't have any effect.

To change the primary color, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone the PrimeNG GitHub repository: https://github.com/primefaces/primeng

2. Navigate to the `src/assets/components/themes` folder. Here you will find the saga-blue theme folder.

3. Inside the saga-blue folder, you will find a file named `saga-blue.scss`. This is the file where the primary color is defined.

4. Open the `saga-blue.scss` file and find the line where the primary color is defined. It should look something like this: `$primaryColor: #1976d2;`

5. Change the color value to the color you want.

6. After you've made the changes, you need to compile the SCSS to CSS. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal: `npm run build:styles`.

7. The compiled CSS will be in the `dist` folder. Replace the old CSS file in your project with the new one.

8. Now your theme should have the new primary color.

Remember, you need to have Node.js and npm installed on your computer to run the build command. Also, every time you want to change the color, you need to recompile the SCSS to CSS.

If you want to change the hover and focus colors, you can find them in the `saga-blue.scss` file as well. They are usually defined with the lighten and darken functions. For example, `lighten($primaryColor, 10%)` or `darken($primaryColor, 10%)`. You can adjust the percentage to get the shade you want.

PrimeNG uses the CSS variables for its theming which makes it easier to customize the theme. However, if you're using a pre-built theme like saga-blue, the colors are already compiled into the CSS and the `--primary-color` variable may not have an effect.

To change the primary color, you can follow these steps:

1. **Customize the theme:**

   PrimeNG uses SASS for its styles, and you can customize the theme by changing the SASS variables. You need to download the source SASS files of the theme, change the variables, and then compile the SASS to CSS.

   You can find the SASS files for the saga-blue theme in the PrimeNG GitHub repository. The main file is `_theme.scss` and the variables are defined in `_variables.scss`.

   Change the `$primaryColor` variable to the color you want, and then compile the SASS to CSS. You can use a SASS compiler like `node-sass` or `dart-sass`.

2. **Override the CSS:**

   If you can't or don't want to customize the SASS files, you can override the CSS in your own styles. You need to find the CSS rules that use the primary color and write your own rules with a higher specificity.

   To make it easier, you can use a CSS post-processor like PostCSS. You can write a PostCSS plugin that changes the primary color in the CSS file. The plugin can find the color codes and replace them with your color.

   Note that PrimeNG uses different shades of the primary color for different states like hover and focus. You need to find these shades and replace them too. You can use a color tool to find the shades of your color.

3. **Use a custom theme:**

   If you need more customization, you can create your own theme. PrimeNG provides a tool called Theme Designer that you can use to create a custom theme. You can choose the colors, fonts, and other styles, and the tool generates the CSS for you.

Remember to include your custom CSS file in your project and remove the saga-blue theme.
