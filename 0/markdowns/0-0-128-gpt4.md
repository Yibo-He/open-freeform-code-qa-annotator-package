I'm wondering how should I reset a reactive in vuejs setup? (i know if change it to the ref and using view.value will solve this problem, but there should be an answer to this for using reactive)
```
setup(props, context){
  // states
  const DataTable = reactive((null as unknown) as DataTable);
  const PolicyForm = reactive((null as unknown) as PolicyForm);
  let view = reactive(resetViewState());
  let config = reactive(
    (resetPreRegisterConfig() as unknown) as PreRegisterConfig
  );
  // methods:
  const fetchProfilelist = (
    pagination: Pagination{ page:1, size:15},
    sort_label: string = ""
  ) => {
    DataTable.fetchTablelist(api_fetchProfilelist, pagination, sort_label);
  };
  const pageRefresh = () => {
    view = resetViewState(); // 
    config = resetPreRegisterConfig();
    fetchProfilelist();

  };
  return {
    DataTable,
    PolicyForm,
    view,
    config,
    fetchProfilelist,
    pageRefresh
  }
```

In Vue.js, the `reactive` method is used to create a reactive object. However, reassigning a new value to a reactive object directly won't work as expected because it will lose its reactivity. 

To reset a reactive object, you can use the `Object.assign` method to replace the properties of the reactive object with the properties of the new object. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
setup(props, context){
  // states
  const DataTable = reactive((null as unknown) as DataTable);
  const PolicyForm = reactive((null as unknown) as PolicyForm);
  let view = reactive(resetViewState());
  let config = reactive(
    (resetPreRegisterConfig() as unknown) as PreRegisterConfig
  );
  // methods:
  const fetchProfilelist = (
    pagination: Pagination{ page:1, size:15},
    sort_label: string = ""
  ) => {
    DataTable.fetchTablelist(api_fetchProfilelist, pagination, sort_label);
  };
  const pageRefresh = () => {
    Object.assign(view, resetViewState()); // reset view
    Object.assign(config, resetPreRegisterConfig()); // reset config
    fetchProfilelist();
  };
  return {
    DataTable,
    PolicyForm,
    view,
    config,
    fetchProfilelist,
    pageRefresh
  }
}
```

In the `pageRefresh` method, `Object.assign(view, resetViewState())` will replace the properties of `view` with the properties of the object returned by `resetViewState()`. The same goes for `config`. This way, you can reset the reactive objects without losing their reactivity.

In Vue.js, when you use `reactive()`, you are creating a reactive object. If you want to reset this object, you can't just assign a new object to the variable that holds the reactive object. This is because the variable is just a reference to the reactive object, and changing the reference doesn't change the original object.

Instead, you need to mutate the properties of the reactive object. If you want to reset the object to its initial state, you can create a function that returns the initial state, and then use `Object.assign()` to overwrite the properties of the reactive object with the properties of the initial state.

Here is how you can modify your `pageRefresh` method to reset `view` and `config`:

```javascript
const pageRefresh = () => {
  Object.assign(view, resetViewState());
  Object.assign(config, resetPreRegisterConfig());
  fetchProfilelist();
};
```

In this code, `Object.assign(view, resetViewState())` will mutate all properties of `view` to match the properties of the object returned by `resetViewState()`. The same goes for `config` and `resetPreRegisterConfig()`.

In Vue 3, the `reactive` object is mutable, but you can't assign a new object to it directly. Instead, you can use the `toRefs` function to convert the reactive object to a set of refs, then you can change the properties of the reactive object.

Here's how you can reset the `view` and `config` reactive objects:

```javascript
import { reactive, toRefs } from 'vue';

setup(props, context){
  // states
  const DataTable = reactive((null as unknown) as DataTable);
  const PolicyForm = reactive((null as unknown) as PolicyForm);
  let view = reactive(resetViewState());
  let config = reactive(
    (resetPreRegisterConfig() as unknown) as PreRegisterConfig
  );
  // methods:
  const fetchProfilelist = (
    pagination: Pagination{ page:1, size:15},
    sort_label: string = ""
  ) => {
    DataTable.fetchTablelist(api_fetchProfilelist, pagination, sort_label);
  };
  const pageRefresh = () => {
    const newViewState = resetViewState();
    const newConfig = resetPreRegisterConfig();
    Object.keys(view).forEach(key => {
      view[key] = newViewState[key];
    });
    Object.keys(config).forEach(key => {
      config[key] = newConfig[key];
    });
    fetchProfilelist();
  };
  return {
    DataTable,
    PolicyForm,
    view,
    config,
    fetchProfilelist,
    pageRefresh
  }
}
```

In the `pageRefresh` method, we're creating new objects `newViewState` and `newConfig` by calling the reset functions. Then, we're iterating over the keys of the `view` and `config` objects and assigning the corresponding values from the new objects. This way, we're effectively resetting the `view` and `config` objects without creating new reactive objects.
