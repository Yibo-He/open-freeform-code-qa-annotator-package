I'm trying to fetch data using Apollo Client `useQuery` in React Native, but `loading` hangs at true state and fails to fetch `data`.
below is the actual code.
`App.js`
```
import React from 'react';

import { SafeAreaView, Text, View } from 'react-native';

import { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache, gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
    query GetExchangeRates {
        rates(currency: "USD") {
            currency
            rate
        }
    }
`;

const TestScreen = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

    console.log(loading, error, data); // Stop at "true undefined undefined" 

    if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    if (error) return <Text>Error :(</Text>;

    return data.rates.map(({ currency, rate }) => (
        <View key={currency}>
            <Text>
                {currency}: {rate}
            </Text>
        </View>
    ));
};

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    // this uri is the uri provided by the apolloClient official documentation.
    // https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started#3-connect-your-client-to-react
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const App = () => {
    return (
        <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>
            <SafeAreaView>
                <TestScreen />
            </SafeAreaView>
        </ApolloProvider>
    );
};

export default App;
```

            "node"
        ]
    }
}
```


After running `useQuery()`
```
loading = true, error = undefined, data = undefined
                    â†“
loading = false, error = undefined, data = { ... }
```


After running `useQuery()`
```
loading = true, error = undefined, data = undefined (Stuck at 'loading = true' )
```

I don't know what the problem is. Any help would be appreciated.

Version `3.6` implements `useQuery` using `useSyncExternalStore` API from React 18. Since expo currently supports React 17 you can solve the issue by downgrading `@apollo/client` to version `3.5.4` and `graphql` to version `^16.3.0` for now. You can find more information [here](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/releases/tag/v3.6.0).

Unfortunately, this is a known bug, which happened in apollo client 3.6. The last proper working version was 3.5.10. After that, useQuery and useLazyQuery stopped working (stuck on loading), but only on mobile devices/emulators. The web version still working properly.
Try to downgrade to 3.5.10.
[https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/9689](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-client/issues/9689)
EDIT: The new alpha version solves that case (3.7.0-beta.3).
Try : `npm i @apollo/client@beta`

Upgrading to the new alpha version (3.7.0-beta.3)
from @Dominik Myszkowski fixed my issue, downgrading to 3.5.4 did not.

What fixed it for me was downgrading `styled-react-modal` from `^2.1.0` to `^1.2.3`.
Not sure why, except that it uses a provider that's near the top of the component tree.
