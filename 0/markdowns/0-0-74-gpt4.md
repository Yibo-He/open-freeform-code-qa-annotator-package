How can I get the previous URL in Next.js?
I thought the values `this.props.router.asPath` and `nextProps.router.asPath` are different.
Actually, I want to call `router.push` after login. I know that `router.back` goes to the previous page. But it's possible to go to another site. The users having history stacks go to the previous page, the users not having history stacks go to `/` main page.
```
import { Component } from 'react'
import App, { Container } from 'next/app';
import ErrorComponent from '@/components/error'

export default class MyApp extends App {
  render() {
    console.log(this.props)
    const { Component, pageProps, router } = this.props;
    const props = {
      ...pageProps,
      router
    }
    return (
      <ErrorBoundary>
        <Container>
          <Component {...props} />
        </Container>
      </ErrorBoundary>
    );
  }

  componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
    // previous page url /contents
    console.log(this.props.router.asPath) // /about
    console.log(nextProps.router.asPath) // /about
    console.log('window.history.previous.href', window.history.previous) // undefined
  }
}
```

How can I fix it? Or how can I get the previous URL to move page after login?

Next.js does not provide a built-in way to get the previous URL. However, you can manage this by yourself using a custom middleware in your `_app.js` file. 

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      // store the current URL in localStorage when the route changes
      localStorage.setItem('previousURL', router.asPath);
    };

    // listen to route changes
    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange);

    // cleanup the listener when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

This code will store the current URL in localStorage every time the route changes. You can then retrieve the previous URL from localStorage whenever you need it.

Remember that this solution assumes that localStorage is available. If you're running this code on the server or in an environment where localStorage is not available, you'll need to add a check to prevent errors.

Also, keep in mind that this solution will only work for navigation that happens within your Next.js app. If a user navigates away from your app and then comes back, the previous URL will be the last URL they visited within your app, not the external site they navigated to.

Next.js doesn't provide a built-in way to get the previous URL. However, you can achieve this by using a custom middleware in your `_app.js` file. This middleware will store the current URL in a cookie before rendering a new page. Then, you can read this cookie to get the previous URL.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

1. Install `js-cookie` and `next-cookies`:

```bash
npm install js-cookie next-cookies
```

2. In your `_app.js` file, add a middleware that sets a cookie with the current path:

```jsx
import App from 'next/app';
import Router from 'next/router';
import Cookies from 'js-cookie';

Router.events.on('routeChangeStart', (url) => {
  Cookies.set('previousUrl', url, { expires: 7 });
});

class MyApp extends App {
  // your code...
}

export default MyApp;
```

3. Now, you can get the previous URL from the cookie:

```jsx
import { parseCookies } from 'nookies';

const cookies = parseCookies();
const previousUrl = cookies.previousUrl;
```

This will give you the previous URL before the page was rendered. Remember that this will only work on the client side, as cookies are not accessible on the server side during server-side rendering (SSR). If you need to access the previous URL on the server side, you may need to implement a different solution, such as storing the previous URL in a session.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Next.js does not provide a built-in way to access the previous URL. However, you can manage this by yourself using a custom middleware in your `_app.js` file.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleRouteChange = (url) => {
      // store the current URL in localStorage when the route changes
      localStorage.setItem('previousURL', router.asPath);
    };

    // listen to route changes
    router.events.on('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange);

    // cleanup the listener when the component unmounts
    return () => {
      router.events.off('routeChangeStart', handleRouteChange);
    };
  }, []);

  return <Component {...pageProps} />;
}

export default MyApp;
```

In this example, we're using the `useEffect` hook to listen to route changes. When the route changes, we store the current URL in `localStorage`. You can then access the previous URL from `localStorage` whenever you need it.

Please note that this solution assumes that the user does not manually change the URL in the browser's address bar. If the user manually changes the URL, the previous URL stored in `localStorage` will not be accurate. Also, this solution may not work if the user has disabled `localStorage` in their browser.
