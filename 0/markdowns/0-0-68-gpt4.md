I am trying to spy on useState React hook but i always get the test failed
This is my React component:
```
const Counter= () => {
    const[counter, setCounter] = useState(0);

    const handleClick=() => {
        setCounter(counter + 1);
    }

    return (
        <div>
            <h2>{counter}</h2>
            <button onClick={handleClick} id="button">increment</button>
        </div>
    )
}
```

:
```
it('increment counter correctlry', () => {
    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);
     const button = wrapper.find("button")
     button.simulate('click');
     expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

Unfortunately this doesn't work and i get the test failed with that message:
```
expected 1
Number of calls: 0
```

The issue here is that you're trying to spy on the `useState` hook after the component has already been rendered with `shallow(<Counter/>)`. At this point, the `useState` hook has already been called, and spying on it afterwards won't have any effect.

You need to set up your spy before you render your component. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);

    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);

    const button = wrapper.find("button")
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

However, this approach has a limitation. It assumes that `useState` is only called once in your component. If `useState` is called multiple times, this test will fail because the mock implementation will be used for all calls to `useState`, not just the one you're interested in.

A better approach would be to test the behavior of the component, rather than the implementation details. You can do this by checking if the counter value has been incremented after the button click:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);
    const button = wrapper.find("button")
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(wrapper.find('h2').text()).toEqual('1');
})
```

This test checks that the counter value displayed in the `h2` tag is incremented after the button click, which is the actual behavior you're interested in.

The issue you're facing is because you're trying to mock `useState` after the component has already been rendered with `shallow`. The `useState` hook has already been called before you're trying to mock it. 

Here is how you can fix it:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);

    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);

    const button = wrapper.find("button")
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

However, this approach of spying on `useState` is not recommended. It's generally better to test the behavior of your components rather than their implementation details. 

Instead, you could test if the counter value is incremented after the button click:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);

    const button = wrapper.find("button")
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(wrapper.find('h2').text()).toEqual('1');
})
```

This way, you're testing the actual output of your component, which is more valuable and makes your tests less brittle.

The issue here is that you are trying to spy on the `useState` hook after the component has already been rendered with `shallow(<Counter/>)`. At this point, the `useState` hook has already been called, so the spy won't be able to catch it.

You need to set up the spy before rendering the component. Here's how you can do it:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    const setState = jest.fn();
    const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

    useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);

    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);

    const button = wrapper.find("button");
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
})
```

However, this approach has a problem. The `useState` hook is not being called with the updated state, but with the initial state. This is because the `setState` mock function doesn't actually update the state. 

A better approach would be to test the behavior of the component, rather than the implementation details. You can do this by checking if the counter is incremented when the button is clicked:

```jsx
it('increment counter correctly', () => {
    let wrapper = shallow(<Counter/>);

    const button = wrapper.find("button");
    button.simulate('click');
    expect(wrapper.find('h2').text()).toEqual('1');
})
```

This test checks if the counter is incremented when the button is clicked, which is the actual behavior you want to test.
