I am using Electron to create a Windows application that creates a fullscreen transparent overlay window. The purpose of this overlay is to:

1. take a screenshot of the entire screen (not the overlay itself which is transparent, but the screen 'underneath'),
2. process this image by sending the image as a byte stream to my python server, and
3. draw some things on the overlay


I am getting stuck on the first step, which is the screenshot capturing process.
I tried , which is to use `capturePage()`:
```
this.electronService.remote.getCurrentWindow().webContents.capturePage()
    .then((img: Electron.NativeImage) => { ... }
```

but this captures my overlay window only (and not the desktop screen). This will be a blank image which is useless to me.
 is to use `desktopCapturer`:
```
this.electronService.remote.desktopCapturer.getSources({types: ['screen']}).then(sources => {
    for (const source of sources) {
        if (source.name === 'Screen 1') {
            try {
                const mediaDevices = navigator.mediaDevices as any;
                mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
                    audio: false,
                    video: { // this specification is only available for Chrome -> Electron runs on Chromium browser
                        mandatory: {
                            chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
                            chromeMediaSourceId: source.id,
                            minWidth: 1280,
                            maxWidth: 1280,
                            minHeight: 720,
                            maxHeight: 720
                        }
                    }
                }).then((stream: MediaStream) => { // stream.getVideoTracks()[0] contains the video track I need
                    this.handleStream(stream);
                });
            } catch (e) {
            }
        }
    }
});
```

The next step is where it becomes fuzzy for me.  What do I do with the acquired `MediaStream` to get a bytestream from the screenshot out of it? I see plenty of examples how to display this stream on a webpage, but I wish to send it to my backend. [This StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51543595/get-a-stream-of-bytes-from-navigator-mediadevices-getusermedia) mentions how to do it, but I am not getting it to work properly.  This is how I implemented `handleStream()`:
```
import * as MediaStreamRecorder from 'msr';

private handleStream(stream: MediaStream): void {
    recorder.stop()
    const recorder = new MediaStreamRecorder(stream);
    recorder.ondataavailable = (blob: Blob) => { // I immediately get a blob, while the linked SO page got an event and had to get a blob through event.data
        this.http.post<Result>('http://localhost:5050', blob);
    };

    // make data available event fire every one second
    recorder.start(1000);
}
```

The `blob` is not being accepted by the Python server.  Upon inspecting the contents of `Blob`, it's a video as I suspected.  I verified this with the following code:
```
let url = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
window.open(url, '_blank')
```

which opens the blob in a new window. It displays a video of maybe half a second, but I want to have a static image. So how do I get a specific snapshot out of it? I'm also not sure if simply sending the Javascript blob format in the POST body will do for Python to be correctly interpret it. In Java it works by simply sending a `byte[]` of the image so I verified that the Python server implementation works as expected.
Any suggestions other than using the `desktopCapturer` are also fine.  This implementation is capturing my mouse as well, which I rather not have.  I must admit that I did not expect this feature to be so difficult to implement.

To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, you can use the `desktopCapturer` module in Electron. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
const { desktopCapturer } = require('electron');

desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['screen'] }).then(async sources => {
  for (const source of sources) {
    try {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        audio: false,
        video: {
          mandatory: {
            chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
            chromeMediaSourceId: source.id,
            minWidth: 1280,
            maxWidth: 1280,
            minHeight: 720,
            maxHeight: 720
          }
        }
      });
      const track = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];
      const imageCapture = new ImageCapture(track);
      const bitmap = await imageCapture.grabFrame();
      const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
      canvas.width = bitmap.width;
      canvas.height = bitmap.height;
      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
      ctx.drawImage(bitmap, 0, 0);
      const dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL();
      const base64Data = dataUrl.replace(/^data:image\/png;base64,/, '');
      const buffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');
      // send buffer to server
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  }
});
```

This code uses the `ImageCapture` API to grab a frame from the video stream and then draws it onto a canvas. The resulting image is then converted to a base64-encoded PNG and sent to the server as a buffer.

As for the mouse cursor, you can hide it by setting the `cursor` CSS property to `none` on the body element:

```
document.body.style.cursor = 'none';
```

To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, you can use the `electron.screen` module. Here's an example code snippet:

```
const { screen } = require('electron');

const display = screen.getPrimaryDisplay();
const screenshot = display.getBitmap();

// send the screenshot to your Python server
```

This will capture the entire screen and return a `Bitmap` object that you can send to your Python server. You can then convert the `Bitmap` object to a byte stream using the `toPNG()` or `toJPEG()` methods.

As for the overlay, you can use the `BrowserWindow` module to create a transparent window that overlays the screen. Here's an example code snippet:

```
const { BrowserWindow } = require('electron');

const overlay = new BrowserWindow({
  width: display.bounds.width,
  height: display.bounds.height,
  transparent: true,
  frame: false,
  alwaysOnTop: true,
  skipTaskbar: true,
  webPreferences: {
    nodeIntegration: true
  }
});

overlay.setIgnoreMouseEvents(true);
overlay.setResizable(false);
overlay.setFullScreen(true);
overlay.setFullScreenable(false);
overlay.loadFile('path/to/overlay.html');
```

This will create a transparent window that covers the entire screen and loads an HTML file as the overlay. You can then draw on the overlay using HTML canvas or any other method you prefer.

As for the mouse cursor, you can hide it using CSS:

```
* {
  cursor: none !important;
}
```

Add this to your overlay HTML file to hide the mouse cursor.

To capture a screenshot of the entire screen, you can use the `desktopCapturer` module in Electron. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
const { desktopCapturer } = require('electron');

desktopCapturer.getSources({ types: ['screen'] }).then(async sources => {
  for (const source of sources) {
    try {
      const stream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia({
        audio: false,
        video: {
          mandatory: {
            chromeMediaSource: 'desktop',
            chromeMediaSourceId: source.id,
            minWidth: 1280,
            maxWidth: 1280,
            minHeight: 720,
            maxHeight: 720
          }
        }
      });
      const videoTrack = stream.getVideoTracks()[0];
      const imageCapture = new ImageCapture(videoTrack);
      const bitmap = await imageCapture.grabFrame();
      const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
      canvas.width = bitmap.width;
      canvas.height = bitmap.height;
      const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
      ctx.drawImage(bitmap, 0, 0);
      const dataUrl = canvas.toDataURL();
      const base64Data = dataUrl.replace(/^data:image\/png;base64,/, '');
      const buffer = Buffer.from(base64Data, 'base64');
      // send buffer to server
    } catch (e) {
      console.error(e);
    }
  }
});
```

This code captures a screenshot of the entire screen and converts it to a base64-encoded PNG image. You can then convert this to a buffer and send it to your Python server.

To draw things on the overlay, you can use the `canvas` element and the `getContext()` method to get a 2D rendering context. You can then use the various drawing methods to draw shapes, text, images, etc. Here's an example:

```
const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
canvas.width = window.innerWidth;
canvas.height = window.innerHeight;
canvas.style.position = 'absolute';
canvas.style.top = '0';
canvas.style.left = '0';
canvas.style.pointerEvents = 'none';
document.body.appendChild(canvas);

const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
ctx.fillStyle = 'rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)';
ctx.fillRect(0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);
ctx.font = '48px serif';
ctx.fillStyle = 'white';
ctx.fillText('Hello, world!', 50, 100);
```

This code creates a `canvas` element that covers the entire screen and draws a semi-transparent red rectangle and some white text on it. The `pointerEvents` style is set to `none` so that mouse events pass through the overlay to the underlying window.
