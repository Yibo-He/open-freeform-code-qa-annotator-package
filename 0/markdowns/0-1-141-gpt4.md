I have been experimenting with full responsive layouts between desktops, tablet, and mobile phone sizes for a bit but am having trouble with the layout below.
I was using a grid layout from bootstrap but since it is two columns, as the width shrinks, the second column of two  goes below the left, main content section. I want to split it up as the screen caps below state.
This is the starting view:

This is what I want to happen:

This would be the mobile phone view:

So the wide view will get shrunk during testing and I want it to jump to the mobile view where the top side bar goes above the main content and matches the width of the main content while the bottom sidebar does the same thing to the bottom.
It is easy to put both sidebars on the bottom but I want to try to figure out the possibility of splitting it up.
For testing I am using flexbox, css3 and bootstrap5+ and no plugins or javascript.

In order to achieve the layout you're looking for, you can use CSS Flexbox and Media Queries. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:

HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="main">Main Content</div>
  <div class="sidebar-top">Top Sidebar</div>
  <div class="sidebar-bottom">Bottom Sidebar</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.main {
  order: 2;
}

.sidebar-top {
  order: 1;
}

.sidebar-bottom {
  order: 3;
}

@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }

  .main {
    order: 2;
    flex: 2;
  }

  .sidebar-top {
    order: 1;
    flex: 1;
  }

  .sidebar-bottom {
    order: 3;
    flex: 1;
  }
}

@media (min-width: 992px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: row;
  }

  .main {
    order: 1;
    flex: 2;
  }

  .sidebar-top {
    order: 2;
    flex: 1;
  }

  .sidebar-bottom {
    order: 3;
    flex: 1;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `order` property is used to control the order of the elements in the flex container. The `flex` property is used to control the size of the elements. The `@media` rules are used to apply different styles for different screen sizes. 

The `min-width: 768px` media query is for tablet screens, and the `min-width: 992px` media query is for desktop screens. You can adjust these values according to your needs.

Please note that this is a simplified example and you might need to adjust it according to your specific needs.

To achieve this layout, you can use CSS Grid instead of Bootstrap's grid system. CSS Grid gives you more control over the placement of items at different screen sizes. Here's a basic example of how you can do it:

HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="item1">Sidebar 1</div>
  <div class="item2">Main Content</div>
  <div class="item3">Sidebar 2</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "item1 item2"
    "item3 item2";
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  grid-template-rows: 1fr 1fr;
  gap: 10px;
}

.item1 { grid-area: item1; }
.item2 { grid-area: item2; }
.item3 { grid-area: item3; }

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-areas: 
      "item1"
      "item2"
      "item3";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    grid-template-rows: auto;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `grid-template-areas` property is used to create a grid template. The names specified in this property are associated with the `grid-area` property in the grid items. 

In the media query, the grid template is changed to stack all items on top of each other when the viewport width is 768px or less. This is the point at which the layout will switch to the mobile view. 

You can adjust the values in the `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-rows`, and `gap` properties as needed to fit your design. 

Remember to include the viewport meta tag in your HTML to ensure your media queries work as expected:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">
```

You can achieve this layout using CSS Grid and media queries. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:

HTML:
```html
<div class="container">
  <div class="sidebar-top">Sidebar Top</div>
  <div class="main-content">Main Content</div>
  <div class="sidebar-bottom">Sidebar Bottom</div>
</div>
```

CSS:
```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas: 
    "sidebar-top main-content"
    "sidebar-bottom main-content";
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 3fr;
}

.sidebar-top {
  grid-area: sidebar-top;
}

.main-content {
  grid-area: main-content;
}

.sidebar-bottom {
  grid-area: sidebar-bottom;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-areas: 
      "sidebar-top"
      "main-content"
      "sidebar-bottom";
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }
}
```

In this example, the `.container` div is set to display as a grid. The `grid-template-areas` property is used to define a grid template by referencing the names of the grid areas which are specified with the `grid-area` property.

In the media query, when the viewport is 768px or less, the grid template changes to a single column layout, and the sidebar top, main content, and sidebar bottom are stacked on top of each other.

Please note that you need to replace "sidebar-top", "main-content", and "sidebar-bottom" with the actual class names of your elements. Also, adjust the `max-width` in the media query to the point where you want the layout to change.
