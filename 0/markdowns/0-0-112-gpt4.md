When I try to run `node app.js`, I get error:
> the message is Failed to launch the browser process! spawn
/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
> EACCES

I checked  the folder at `/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app` and the file is not zipped. It can be run.

If I try to execute without the path,  it works, but
I would like to use either Chrome or Chromium to open a new page.
`const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false'});`
```
const express = require('express');
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const app = express();

(async () => {
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false, executablePath:'/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app'});
 const page = await browser.newPage();
 await page.goto('https://google.com', {waitUntil: 'networkidle2'});

})().catch((error) =>{
  console.error("the message is " + error.message);
});

app.listen(3000, function (){
    console.log('server started');
})
```

The error message `EACCES` typically means that the process does not have sufficient permissions to access a file or directory. 

In this case, it seems like the Node.js process does not have the necessary permissions to access the Chromium executable at the specified path. 

You can try to change the permissions of the Chromium executable using the `chmod` command in your terminal:

```bash
sudo chmod 755 /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
```

This command will give read and execute permissions to all users and write permission to the owner.

If this doesn't solve your problem, you can try to use Puppeteer with bundled Chromium (which is the default behavior). Puppeteer will download and use a specific version of Chromium. 

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false});
```

If you still want to use a specific version of Chrome or Chromium, you should point `executablePath` to the actual executable file, not the .app folder. For example:

```javascript
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false, executablePath:'/Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome'});
```

Remember to replace the path with the actual path to your Chrome or Chromium executable.

The error message `EACCES` means that the Node.js process does not have sufficient permissions to execute the file at the specified path. 

You can try to change the permissions of the Chromium.app file to make it executable. You can do this with the `chmod` command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
```

This command changes the permissions of the file to make it executable by the user. The `+x` flag adds execute permissions.

If this doesn't work, you might need to change the ownership of the file or directory with the `chown` command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
```

This command changes the owner of the file or directory to the current user. The `-R` flag applies the command recursively to all files and directories within the specified directory.

If none of these solutions work, there might be an issue with the path you're providing to the `executablePath` option. Make sure that the path points directly to the executable file, not just the .app directory. For example, the path might need to be something like `/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.

The error message `EACCES` usually means that the process does not have necessary permissions to execute the file or access the directory.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Change the permissions of the Chromium directory:**
   You can use the `chmod` command to change the permissions of the directory. Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   sudo chmod -R 755 /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
   ```

   This command will prompt you for your password, then change the permissions of the directory and all its contents to be readable and executable by all users, and writable by the owner.

2. **Use the `puppeteer` package with bundled Chromium:**
   The `puppeteer` package comes with a specific version of Chromium that is guaranteed to work with the library. You can use this version instead of specifying your own path. Just remove the `executablePath` option from the `puppeteer.launch` call:

   ```javascript
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false});
   ```

3. **Specify the correct path to the Chromium executable:**
   The path you're providing should point to the actual executable file, not the `.app` directory. On macOS, the executable is usually located in the `Contents/MacOS` subdirectory. Try changing the `executablePath` option to:

   ```javascript
   const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
     headless: false,
     executablePath: '/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium'
   });
   ```

   Make sure the path is correct and the `Chromium` file is executable.

Remember to replace `/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app` with your actual path if it's different.
