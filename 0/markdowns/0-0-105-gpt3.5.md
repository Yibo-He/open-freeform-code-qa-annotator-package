I'm learning both Jest and Cypress at same time. I know that they are not direct competitors because Cypress is focused on E2E and Jest on unit testing. For now I have implemented in my project both Jest and Cypress with few tests.
But actually most things I can test in both Cypress and Jest, and often I have hard time to decide with what write my test. Also it is harder to maintain compared to single test library.
I'm wondering - how often is Cypress (or alternative) and Jest (or alternative) used together? Is it really standard and good practice to use both? Or most developers/teams sticks with single one solution and it is fine?
: It was a long time since this question was asked. I got compromise that was also suggested in comment. Instead using only Cypress or Cypress + Jest, I'm using Cypress + new Cypress Component Testing (so no Jest). Thanks to that I'm having same library and assertions (easier to manage) but can test both e2e and components.

It is not common to use both Cypress and Jest together in a single project. While it is possible to use both, it can lead to confusion and maintenance issues, as you have mentioned. 

Most developers and teams choose one testing library that best suits their needs and stick with it. If you are testing primarily for end-to-end functionality, Cypress is a great choice. If you are testing primarily for unit testing, Jest is a popular option. 

However, it is important to note that there are other testing libraries available that may better suit your needs, such as Mocha, Chai, and Enzyme. It is worth exploring these options to find the best fit for your project. 

In summary, while it is possible to use both Cypress and Jest together, it is not a common practice. Most developers and teams choose one testing library that best suits their needs and stick with it.

It is not common to use both Cypress and Jest together, as they serve different purposes. Jest is primarily used for unit testing, while Cypress is used for end-to-end testing. 

However, there may be cases where using both can be beneficial. For example, if you have a complex application with many components, you may want to use Jest to test individual components and Cypress to test the application as a whole. 

Ultimately, the decision to use both or just one testing library depends on the specific needs of your project and the preferences of your team. It's important to consider the trade-offs of using multiple testing libraries, such as increased complexity and maintenance, versus the benefits of having a more comprehensive testing strategy.

It is not common to use both Cypress and Jest together in the same project, as they serve different purposes and can lead to unnecessary duplication of effort. 

Cypress is primarily used for end-to-end testing, while Jest is used for unit testing. If you are testing the same functionality in both libraries, it may be worth reconsidering which library is best suited for the task at hand. 

That being said, there may be cases where using both libraries makes sense. For example, if you have a complex application with many different types of tests, you may find that Cypress is better suited for some tests while Jest is better suited for others. 

Ultimately, the decision to use one or both libraries will depend on the specific needs of your project and the preferences of your team. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and choose the one that works best for your situation.
