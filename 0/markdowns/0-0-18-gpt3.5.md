I'm currently working on a signup form and the following is a snippet of my code:

```
const Signup = () => {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
    const [passwordConfirmation, setPasswordConfirmation] = useState('')

    const clearState = () => {
        setUsername('')
        setEmail('')
        setPassword('')
        setPasswordConfirmation('')
    }

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            clearState() // <-----------
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```


Each piece of state is used for a controlled input for the form.

Essentially what I want to do is after the user has successfully signed up, I want the state to go back to the initial state with the fields cleared.

It's quite imperative to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings in`clearState` I was wondering if there is a method or function that comes with React that resets the state back to its initial values?

There is no built-in method or function in React that resets the state back to its initial values. However, you can create a separate object that holds the initial state values and use it to reset the state. Here's an example:

```
const Signup = () => {
    const initialState = {
        username: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        passwordConfirmation: ''
    }

    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

    const clearState = () => {
        setState(initialState)
    }

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            clearState()
        })
    }

    const handleChange = e => {
        const { name, value } = e.target
        setState(prevState => ({ ...prevState, [name]: value }))
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```

In this example, we create an `initialState` object that holds the initial values for each piece of state. We then use `useState` to initialize the state with the `initialState` object. 

In the `clearState` function, we simply call `setState` with the `initialState` object to reset the state.

Note that we also need to update the `handleChange` function to use the `setState` function to update the state. We use the spread operator to copy the previous state and then update the specific property with the new value.

There is no built-in method or function in React that resets the state back to its initial values. However, you can create a separate object that holds the initial state values and use it to reset the state.

Here's an example:

    const initialState = {
        username: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        passwordConfirmation: ''
    }

    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            setState(initialState) // <-----------
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```

In this example, we create an `initialState` object that holds the initial values for each piece of state. Then, in the `handleSubmit` function, we use `setState` to set the state back to the `initialState` object. This way, we don't have to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings in `clearState`.

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            clearState()
        })
    }

    const handleChange = e => {
        const { name, value } = e.target
        setState(prevState => ({ ...prevState, [name]: value }))
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```

In this example, we define an `initialState` object that holds the initial values for each piece of state. We then use `useState` to create a `state` object that holds the current values for each piece of state.

In the `clearState` function, we simply call `setState` with the `initialState` object to reset the state.

We also update the `handleChange` function to use the spread operator to update the state with the new value for the changed input.

By using this approach, you can easily reset the state to its initial values without having to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings.
