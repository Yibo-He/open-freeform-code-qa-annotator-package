I am upgrading react-native from 0.59.5 to 0.60.4 with my existing application. But facing a problem as below

```
* Where:
Build file '/home/bingl/Projects/blackstar/frontend/android/app/build.gradle'

* What went wrong:
Could not compile build file '/home/bingl/Projects/blackstar/frontend/android/app/build.gradle'.
> startup failed:
  General error during semantic analysis: Unsupported class file major version 57

  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 57

```


And my build.gradle is 

```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28
    buildToolsVersion "28.0.3"

    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    defaultConfig {
        applicationId "com.frontend"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 28
        versionCode 1
        versionName "1.0"
    }
    splits {
        abi {
            reset()
            enable enableSeparateBuildPerCPUArchitecture
            universalApk false  // If true, also generate a universal APK
            include "armeabi-v7a", "x86", "arm64-v8a", "x86_64"
        }
    }
    buildTypes {
        release {
            minifyEnabled enableProguardInReleaseBuilds
            proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
        }
    }
    // applicationVariants are e.g. debug, release
    applicationVariants.all { variant ->
        variant.outputs.each { output ->
            // For each separate APK per architecture, set a unique version code as described here:
            // http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/user-guide/apk-splits
            def versionCodes = ["armeabi-v7a":1, "x86":2, "arm64-v8a": 3, "x86_64": 4]
            def abi = output.getFilter(OutputFile.ABI)
            if (abi != null) {  // null for the universal-debug, universal-release variants
                output.versionCodeOverride =
                        versionCodes.get(abi) * 1048576 + defaultConfig.versionCode
            }
        }
    }
```


I have absolutely no clue what this error is about and could not find much helpful articles. Please help me out.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

This error occurs when you are trying to compile a class file that was compiled with a newer version of Java than the one you are currently using. In this case, the error message indicates that the class file was compiled with Java 13 (major version 57), but you are using Java 8.

To fix this issue, you need to update your Java version to at least Java 13. You can download and install the latest version of Java from the official website. Once you have installed the latest version of Java, you need to update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to point to the new installation.

You can update your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable by following these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Type `echo $JAVA_HOME` to check the current value of `JAVA_HOME`.
3. If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, you can set it by typing `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/java` (replace `/path/to/java` with the path to your Java installation directory).
4. If `JAVA_HOME` is already set, you can update it by typing `export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/new/java` (replace `/path/to/new/java` with the path to your new Java installation directory).
5. Type `echo $JAVA_HOME` again to verify that `JAVA_HOME` has been updated correctly.

After updating your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable, try running your build again. This should resolve the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

This error is caused by the fact that the version of the Java bytecode used in your code is not supported by the version of the Java runtime used by the Android build system. 

The error message indicates that the class file major version 57 is not supported. This corresponds to Java 13, which is not yet supported by the Android build system.

To fix this issue, you need to update your Java version to a supported version. You can either downgrade your Java version to a supported version or upgrade your Android build system to support the latest Java version.

To downgrade your Java version, you can install an older version of the JDK and set the JAVA_HOME environment variable to point to the installation directory of the older version.

To upgrade your Android build system, you can update your build.gradle file to use a newer version of the Android Gradle plugin that supports the latest Java version. You can check the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin on the official Android developer website.

Once you have updated your Java version or Android Gradle plugin, you should be able to build your project without any issues.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

This error occurs when the version of the Java compiler used to compile the code is not compatible with the version of the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) used to run the code. In this case, the error message indicates that the class file major version 57 is not supported.

Class file major version 57 corresponds to Java 13, which is not supported by Android. To fix this issue, you need to update the Java version used to compile the code to a version that is compatible with Android.

You can update the Java version by adding the following lines to your build.gradle file:

```
android {
    ...
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }
    ...
}
```

This will set the source and target compatibility to Java 8, which is the version supported by Android. After making this change, try building your project again.
