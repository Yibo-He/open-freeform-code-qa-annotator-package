I'm writing some tests for a React app using [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/). I want to check that some text appears, but I need to check it appears in a particular place because I know it already appears somewhere else.
The [Testing Library documentation for queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-queries#bytext) says that the `getByText` query takes a `container` parameter, which I guessed lets you search within that container. I tried doing this, with the `container` and `text` parameters in the order specified in the docs:
```
const container = getByTestId('my-test-id');
expect(getByText(container, 'some text')).toBeTruthy();
```

and I get an error: `matcher.test is not a function`.
If I put the params the other way round:
```
const container = getByTestId('my-test-id');
expect(getByText('some text', container)).toBeTruthy();
```

I get a different error: `Found multiple elements with the text: some text`
Which means it's not searching inside the specified container.
I think I'm not understanding how `getByText` works. What am I doing wrong?

The `getByText` function from Testing Library does indeed take a `container` parameter, but it's not passed as an argument to the function. Instead, it's used as the context on which to call the function. 

Here's how you can use it:

```jsx
const container = getByTestId('my-test-id');
expect(getByText(container, 'some text')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

In this case, `getByText` is called on the `container` object, and 'some text' is passed as the argument. This will search for the text within the specified container.

Also, note that I've used `toBeInTheDocument()` instead of `toBeTruthy()`. The `toBeInTheDocument()` function is a more accurate way to check if an element is in the document. It's part of the `jest-dom` library, which provides custom jest matchers to test the state of the DOM.

If you're not already using `jest-dom`, you can install it with npm:

```bash
npm install --save @testing-library/jest-dom
```

And then import it in your test file:

```jsx
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

This will give you access to additional matchers like `toBeInTheDocument()`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The `getByText` function from Testing Library does indeed take a `container` parameter, but it's not the first parameter. The first parameter is the text or text matcher you're looking for. The `container` parameter is actually an option that you can pass in as part of an options object as the second parameter.

However, the `container` option is not used to scope the search to a specific part of the DOM. Instead, it's used to specify where to start the search from. By default, `getByText` will start searching from the root of the document.

If you want to search within a specific container, you should call `getByText` on the return value of `getByTestId` or any other query that returns a DOM node. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const container = getByTestId('my-test-id');
expect(within(container).getByText('some text')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

In this example, `within(container).getByText('some text')` will return the element with the text 'some text' that is inside the element with the test ID 'my-test-id'. The `toBeInTheDocument()` function is an assertion from `@testing-library/jest-dom` that checks if the element is in the document.

Remember to import `within` from `@testing-library/react`:

```javascript
import { within } from '@testing-library/react';
```

This way, you're ensuring that the text you're looking for is within a specific part of your component.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `getByText` function from Testing Library does indeed take a `container` parameter, but it's not passed as an argument to the function. Instead, it's called as a method on the `container`.

Here's how you can use it:

```javascript
const container = getByTestId('my-test-id');
expect(within(container).getByText('some text')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

In this example, `within` is a function from Testing Library that gets the `getByText` method (and others) to search within the specified container. 

Also, note that I used `toBeInTheDocument()` instead of `toBeTruthy()`. This is a custom Jest matcher from `@testing-library/jest-dom` that provides a more accurate error message for this use case. If the element is not found, it will say so directly, instead of saying something like `expected false to be true`.

Remember to import `within` from `@testing-library/react`:

```javascript
import { within } from '@testing-library/react';
```

And `toBeInTheDocument` from `@testing-library/jest-dom`:

```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```
