Suddenly in one of my jenkins environment build has started failing, while in local machine it seems to be working fine as i have python installed,

From the logs i was able to detect that the problem is with internal dependency that is  from  when i researched by visiting [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) about node-gyp and found the prerequisite that Python needs to be installed.

So my question is that what version of node-sass can i install to bypass this or is there a better solution as my build was running fine till this morning on the same environment.

Any thoughts are much appreciated, Thanks.

It seems like the issue is with node-gyp not being able to find Python executable on your Jenkins environment. As you have already found out, node-gyp requires Python to be installed on the system.

One solution is to install Python on your Jenkins environment and make sure it is added to the PATH environment variable. You can download Python from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Another solution is to use a pre-built binary of node-sass that does not require node-gyp to build. You can try installing the latest version of node-sass (v4.14.1 as of writing this) which includes pre-built binaries for most platforms. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

If you still face issues, you can try clearing the npm cache and reinstalling node-sass:

```
npm cache clean --force
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue is with the node-sass package which requires node-gyp and Python to be installed. You can try installing a version of node-sass that does not require node-gyp and Python by running the following command:

```
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

This version of node-sass does not require node-gyp and Python to be installed.

Alternatively, you can install Python and add it to your system's PATH environment variable. You can download Python from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Once Python is installed, you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. You can do this by running the following command:

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

Replace `C:\Python27\python.exe` with the path to your Python executable.

After setting the PYTHON environment variable, try running the build again. It should work now.

If you are still facing issues, you can try upgrading node-gyp to the latest version by running the following command:

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

This should update node-gyp to the latest version and fix any issues related to it.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the issue is with the node-sass package which requires Python to be installed. You can try installing a version of node-sass that does not require Python by running the following command:

```
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

This version of node-sass does not require Python and should work without any issues.

Alternatively, you can install Python on your Jenkins environment and set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. This should resolve the issue with node-gyp.

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

You can also try upgrading your Node.js version to the latest stable version as it may have better compatibility with node-sass and other dependencies.
