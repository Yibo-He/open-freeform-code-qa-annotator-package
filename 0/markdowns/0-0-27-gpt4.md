I'm trying to fetch data using Apollo Client `useQuery` in React Native, but `loading` hangs at true state and fails to fetch `data`.
below is the actual code.
`App.js`
```
import React from 'react';

import { SafeAreaView, Text, View } from 'react-native';

import { ApolloClient, ApolloProvider, InMemoryCache, gql, useQuery } from '@apollo/client';

const EXCHANGE_RATES = gql`
    query GetExchangeRates {
        rates(currency: "USD") {
            currency
            rate
        }
    }
`;

const TestScreen = () => {
    const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES);

    console.log(loading, error, data); // Stop at "true undefined undefined" 

    if (loading) return <Text>Loading...</Text>;
    if (error) return <Text>Error :(</Text>;

    return data.rates.map(({ currency, rate }) => (
        <View key={currency}>
            <Text>
                {currency}: {rate}
            </Text>
        </View>
    ));
};

const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    // this uri is the uri provided by the apolloClient official documentation.
    // https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/get-started#3-connect-your-client-to-react
    uri: 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io',
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});

const App = () => {
    return (
        <ApolloProvider client={apolloClient}>
            <SafeAreaView>
                <TestScreen />
            </SafeAreaView>
        </ApolloProvider>
    );
};

export default App;
```

After running `useQuery()`
```
loading = true, error = undefined, data = undefined
                    â†“
loading = false, error = undefined, data = { ... }
```


After running `useQuery()`
```
loading = true, error = undefined, data = undefined (Stuck at 'loading = true' )
```

I don't know what the problem is. Any help would be appreciated.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Network Error**: Check if your device/emulator has access to the internet and can reach the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io'. You can test this by trying to fetch data from the server using a different method (like `fetch` or `axios`).

2. **CORS Issue**: If your server is not configured to allow requests from your client's origin, it will result in a network error. You can check this in your server's network logs. If this is the case, you need to configure your server to allow requests from your client's origin.

3. **Server Error**: There might be an issue with the server you're trying to fetch data from. Check the server logs for any errors.

4. **Apollo Client Configuration**: There might be an issue with how you've configured Apollo Client. Try using a different URI to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with how it handles network requests. Try disabling it to see if that resolves the issue.

6. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using and Apollo Client. Try updating React Native to the latest version.

7. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using and React Native. Try updating Apollo Client to the latest version.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider posting this issue on the Apollo Client GitHub page. The maintainers and community there might be able to provide more insight into what's causing this issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you could check:

1. **Network Connection:** Ensure that your device/emulator has a working internet connection. You can test this by making a fetch request to another API or loading a webpage.

2. **API Endpoint:** Verify that the API endpoint you're using is correct and working as expected. You can test this by making a request to the API endpoint in a REST client like Postman or Insomnia.

3. **CORS Policy:** If your server has a CORS policy, it might be blocking requests from your client. You can check this by inspecting the network tab in your browser's developer tools and looking for any CORS-related errors.

4. **Apollo Client Configuration:** Ensure that your Apollo Client is correctly configured. In your case, it seems to be correct, but it's always a good idea to double-check.

5. **Query Syntax:** Make sure that your GraphQL query is correct. You can test this by running the query in a GraphQL playground connected to your API.

6. **React Native Version:** There might be compatibility issues between the version of React Native you're using and the version of Apollo Client. You can try updating React Native or Apollo Client to the latest version.

7. **Error Handling:** It's possible that an error is occurring but it's not being caught. You can add a `catch` block to your query to handle any errors.

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES).catch((error) => {
  console.error('Error:', error);
});
```

8. **Debugging:** Use React Native Debugger or similar tools to debug your application. This can help you identify where the issue is coming from.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your issue, such as any error messages you're seeing and the exact behavior of your application when the issue occurs.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are some things you could try:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a working internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch data from another API.

2. **Check the server**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to access the server in your web browser or using a tool like Postman.

3. **Check the query**: Make sure the query you're sending is correct and the server is able to respond to it. You can test this by running the query in a GraphQL playground connected to the server.

4. **Check for errors**: The `useQuery` hook should return an `error` object if the query fails. You can log this object to see if it contains any useful information. If `error` is `undefined`, it means that the query is still loading or it was successful.

5. **Check your Apollo Client setup**: Make sure you've set up Apollo Client correctly. This includes setting the correct `uri` in the `ApolloClient` constructor and wrapping your component tree with the `ApolloProvider` component.

6. **Update your dependencies**: There might be a bug in the version of `@apollo/client` or `react-native` you're using. Try updating to the latest version.

7. **Check your React Native environment**: There might be an issue with your React Native environment. Try creating a new React Native project and see if you can fetch data in that project.

8. **Try using `fetchPolicy`**: You can pass `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` to `useQuery` to ensure the query is sent to the server and not just trying to fetch from the cache.

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, { fetchPolicy: 'no-cache' });
```

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your environment and the exact error message you're seeing (if any).
