I have a simple example of a component: 

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);
  console.log(observed.current);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```


I would expect that `observed.current` would be of type element and current would not be empty but the div element with all its properties. My understanding would be:


1. The ref is initialised with a value of null
2. Null is overwritten by the ref



But as it turns out, `.current` remains empty. This is bad since I want to pass observed to a function that expects an argument of type Element.

The reason why `observed.current` is empty is because the `console.log` statement is executed before the component is mounted and the `ref` is assigned to the `div` element. 

To access the `div` element, you can use the `useEffect` hook to log the `observed.current` value after the component has mounted:

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

This will log the `div` element with all its properties after the component has mounted.

The reason why `observed.current` is empty is because the `console.log` statement is executed before the component is fully mounted and rendered. 

To access the `div` element with all its properties, you can use the `useEffect` hook to log the `observed.current` value after the component has mounted:

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

This will log the `div` element with all its properties to the console after the component has mounted.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The reason `observed.current` is empty is because the `console.log` statement is being executed before the component is fully mounted and rendered. 

To access the `div` element with all its properties, you can use the `useEffect` hook to wait for the component to mount and then log the `observed.current` value. Here's an updated example:

```
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";

function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

By using the `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array, the callback function will only be executed after the component is mounted and the `div` element has been assigned to `observed.current`.
