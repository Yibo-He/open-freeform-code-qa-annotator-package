```
expo : File C:\Users\saka\AppData\Roaming\npm\expo.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more

The error message you're seeing is due to the execution policy settings in your PowerShell. PowerShell has a feature called "execution policies" to help control the execution of scripts on your system. By default, the policy is set to "Restricted", which means no scripts like your `expo.ps1` are allowed to run.

You can change the execution policy using the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet. Here's how to do it:

1. Open a PowerShell as Administrator. You can do this by searching for PowerShell in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as Administrator".

2. Run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This will set the policy to "RemoteSigned", which means that as long as a script is signed by a trusted publisher, it will run.

3. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.

4. Try running your `expo --version` command again.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to set the execution policy to "Unrestricted". However, please note that this setting is less secure as it allows all scripts to run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Remember to set the execution policy back to its original setting once you're done to maintain the security of your system.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is related to PowerShell's execution policy, which is a safety feature that controls the conditions under which PowerShell loads configuration files and runs scripts. This feature helps prevent the execution of malicious scripts.

You can change the execution policy by running a command in your PowerShell. Here's how:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by searching for "PowerShell" in the Start menu, right-clicking on the "Windows PowerShell" result, and selecting "Run as administrator".

2. Run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

This command sets the execution policy for the current user (you) to "RemoteSigned", which means that PowerShell will run scripts that you've written and scripts from trusted publishers, but it will not run scripts downloaded from the internet unless they have a trusted signature.

3. PowerShell will ask you to confirm the change. Type "Y" and press Enter to confirm.

4. Try running your `expo --version` command again.

If you still encounter the error, you might need to set the execution policy at a different scope. You can do this by running the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` command again, but replacing `CurrentUser` with `LocalMachine`. This will apply the policy to all users on your computer. Be aware that this requires administrative privileges.

Please note that changing the execution policy can have security implications, so you should only do it if you understand what it means and you trust the scripts that you're running.

The error message you're seeing is due to the default execution policy in PowerShell, which is Restricted. This means no scripts are allowed to run, including your `expo.ps1` script.

To solve this issue, you need to change the execution policy in PowerShell. Here's how to do it:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by searching for PowerShell in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as administrator".

2. Once you have the PowerShell window open, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

This command sets the policy to RemoteSigned, which means that as long as a script is signed by a trusted publisher, it will run.

3. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.

4. After the command completes, close the PowerShell window.

5. Now, try running your `expo --version` command again in the Visual Studio Code terminal. It should work without any issues.

Remember that changing the execution policy can have security implications, so only do this if you understand the risks and trust the scripts you're running.
