I have tried installing react icons, in my application I ran the npm command:

```
sudo npm install react-icons --save
```


I didn't get any errors, apart from some optional dependencies, that where skipped

```
npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.4 
(node_modules/fsevents):
npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for 
fsevents@1.2.4: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: 
{"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})
```


Whenever I try to import some of the icons, I get an error

```
./src/components/SkiDaysCount.js
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-icons/lib/md' in ' 
'/home/kristoffer/ReactApps/navbar/src/components'
```


here are my imports:

```
import {Terrain} from 'react-icons/lib/md'
import {SnowFlake} from 'react-icons/lib/ti'
import {Calender} from 'react-icons/lib/fa'
```


Why am I getting this error?

EDIT:

i have also tried using the old syntax for importing, with the same issue as such:

```
import Calender from 'react-icons/lib/fa/calender'
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The issue is that the import statements are incorrect. The correct syntax for importing icons from `react-icons` is:

```
import { MdTerrain } from 'react-icons/md';
import { TiWeatherSnow } from 'react-icons/ti';
import { FaCalendar } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

You need to use the correct icon component name and import it from the correct path. The icon component name is a combination of the icon library name and the icon name, separated by a capital letter. For example, `MdTerrain` is the component for the `Terrain` icon from the `md` library.

Also, make sure that you have saved the changes to the file after making the corrections.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The issue is that the syntax for importing icons from `react-icons` has changed in version 3.0.0. Instead of importing from `react-icons/lib`, you should import directly from the icon's package. For example:

```
import { MdTerrain } from 'react-icons/md';
import { TiSnowflake } from 'react-icons/ti';
import { FaCalendar } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

Make sure to update your imports accordingly and the error should be resolved.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue is that the import paths you are using are outdated. The latest version of `react-icons` no longer uses the `lib` folder in the import path. Instead, you should import the icons directly from the package like this:

```
import { MdTerrain } from 'react-icons/md';
import { TiWeatherSnow } from 'react-icons/ti';
import { FaCalendar } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

Make sure to update your import statements accordingly and it should work.
