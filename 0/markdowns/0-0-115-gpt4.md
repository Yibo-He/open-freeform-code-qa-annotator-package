I am trying to setup Path alias in my project by adding these values to tsconfig.json:

```
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@store/*": ["store/*"]
    },
```


And if I create an import, neither IntelliJ or VSCode bother me:

```
import { AppState } from '@store/index';
```


But when I compile the application I get this warning:

```
The following changes are being made to your tsconfig.json file:
  - compilerOptions.paths must not be set (aliased imports are not supported)
```


And it bombs saying it cannot find the reference:

```
TypeScript error in C:/xyz.tsx(2,26):
Cannot find module '/store'.  TS2307
```


Is there any workaround or it is not supported by `create-react-app --typescript`?

The issue you're facing is because `create-react-app` doesn't support the `paths` option out of the box. This is because `create-react-app` uses Babel to transpile TypeScript, and Babel doesn't understand TypeScript's `paths` option.

However, there are a few workarounds to this:

1. **Using `react-app-rewired` and `react-app-rewire-alias`:** You can use these packages to override the webpack configuration used by `create-react-app` without ejecting.

   First, install the packages:

   ```
   npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired react-app-rewire-alias
   ```

   Then, create a `config-overrides.js` file in your project root:

   ```javascript
   const rewireAliases = require('react-app-rewire-alias');

   module.exports = function override(config, env) {
     config = rewireAliases.aliasesOptions({
       '@store': 'src/store',
     })(config, env);

     return config;
   };
   ```

   Finally, modify the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-app-rewired start",
     "build": "react-app-rewired build",
     "test": "react-app-rewired test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

2. **Using `craco` (Create React App Configuration Override):** This is a more powerful and flexible way to customize `create-react-app` configurations.

   First, install `craco`:

   ```
   npm install @craco/craco
   ```

   Then, create a `craco.config.js` file in your project root:

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');

   module.exports = {
     webpack: {
       alias: {
         '@store': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/store/'),
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   Finally, modify the `scripts` section in your `package.json`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "craco start",
     "build": "craco build",
     "test": "craco test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

Remember to adjust the paths according to your project structure. After applying these changes, you should be able to use the `@store` alias in your imports.

The issue you're facing is because `create-react-app` doesn't support the `paths` option out of the box. This is because the underlying tool, `react-scripts`, uses Babel to transpile the code, and Babel doesn't understand TypeScript's `paths` option.

Here are a few workarounds:

1. **Use `react-app-rewired` and `customize-cra` to override the webpack configuration.**

   Install these packages:

   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired customize-cra
   ```

   Then, create a `config-overrides.js` file in your project root:

   ```javascript
   const { alias, configPaths } = require('react-app-rewire-alias');
   const { paths } = require('./tsconfig.json');

   module.exports = function override(config, env) {
     return alias(configPaths('./tsconfig.paths.json'))(config, env);
   };
   ```

   And modify your `package.json` scripts to use `react-app-rewired` instead of `react-scripts`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "react-app-rewired start",
     "build": "react-app-rewired build",
     "test": "react-app-rewired test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

2. **Use `craco` (Create React App Configuration Override).**

   Install `craco`:

   ```bash
   npm install @craco/craco
   ```

   Then, create a `craco.config.js` file in your project root:

   ```javascript
   const path = require('path');
   const { paths } = require('./tsconfig.json');

   module.exports = {
     webpack: {
       alias: {
         '@store': path.resolve(__dirname, paths.compilerOptions.baseUrl, 'store'),
       },
     },
   };
   ```

   And modify your `package.json` scripts to use `craco` instead of `react-scripts`:

   ```json
   "scripts": {
     "start": "craco start",
     "build": "craco build",
     "test": "craco test",
     "eject": "react-scripts eject"
   }
   ```

3. **Eject from `create-react-app`.**

   This is a more drastic option, but it gives you full control over your build configuration. You can then modify the webpack configuration directly to support the `paths` option. However, this is a one-way operation and you can't go back to using `react-scripts` after ejecting.

   ```bash
   npm run eject
   ```

Please note that these methods involve overriding the default configuration of `create-react-app`, which may lead to unexpected issues. Always make sure to backup your project before making these changes.

The issue you're encountering is because `create-react-app` doesn't support the `paths` option out of the box. This is because the underlying tool, `react-scripts`, doesn't support it.

However, there are a few workarounds:

1. **Use `react-app-rewired` and `react-app-rewire-alias`:** These are tools that let you customize the configuration of `create-react-app` without ejecting from the default setup. Here's how you can use them:

   - Install the packages:

     ```
     npm install --save-dev react-app-rewired react-app-rewire-alias
     ```

   - Create a `config-overrides.js` file in the root of your project with the following content:

     ```javascript
     const rewireAliases = require('react-app-rewire-alias');

     module.exports = function override(config, env) {
       config = rewireAliases.aliasesOptions({
         '@store': 'src/store',
       })(config, env);

       return config;
     };
     ```

   - Modify the `scripts` section of your `package.json`:

     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "react-app-rewired start",
       "build": "react-app-rewired build",
       "test": "react-app-rewired test",
       "eject": "react-scripts eject"
     }
     ```

2. **Use `babel-plugin-module-resolver`:** This is a Babel plugin that can rewrite your imports at compile time:

   - Install the plugin:

     ```
     npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-module-resolver
     ```

   - Create a `.babelrc` file in the root of your project with the following content:

     ```json
     {
       "plugins": [
         ["module-resolver", {
           "root": ["./src"],
           "alias": {
             "@store": "./src/store"
           }
         }]
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Eject from `create-react-app`:** This is the most drastic option, as it will expose all of the configuration and build scripts, allowing you to modify them directly. However, it's generally recommended to avoid ejecting if possible, as it makes it harder to upgrade your project in the future.

   - Run the eject command:

     ```
     npm run eject
     ```

   - Then you can modify the `webpack.config.js` and `tsconfig.json` files directly to support the `paths` option.

Remember to restart your development server after making these changes.
