What's the correct way to use ant design switch inside, I could not get much from the official documentation.
[Switch-Ant Design](https://ant.design/components/switch/)
Here's how I am using it.
```
<Form form={form} layout="vertical">
  <Form.Item
    label="Description"
    name="description"
    rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Enter a description' }]}
  >
    <Input placeholder="Enter Description" />
  </Form.Item>

  <Form.Item name="switch" noStyle valuePropName="checked">
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
    <span>Chargable</span>
  </Form.Item>

  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      form
        .validateFields()
        .then((values) => {
          form.resetFields()
          onCreate(values)
        })
        .catch((info) => {
          console.log('Validate Failed:', info)
        })
    }}
  >
    Save
  </Button>
</Form>
```

onCreate does no take the value from the switch, It does take it from the description
```
const onCreate = (values) => {}
```

The issue you're facing might be due to the `noStyle` prop in your `Form.Item` for the switch. The `noStyle` prop should be used for nested fields but in your case, it's not necessary. 

Here's how you can use the Ant Design Switch inside a Form:

```jsx
<Form form={form} layout="vertical">
  <Form.Item
    label="Description"
    name="description"
    rules={[{ required: true, message: 'Enter a description' }]}
  >
    <Input placeholder="Enter Description" />
  </Form.Item>

  <Form.Item 
    label="Chargable" 
    name="chargable" 
    valuePropName="checked"
  >
    <Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" />
  </Form.Item>

  <Button
    onClick={() => {
      form
        .validateFields()
        .then((values) => {
          form.resetFields()
          onCreate(values)
        })
        .catch((info) => {
          console.log('Validate Failed:', info)
        })
    }}
  >
    Save
  </Button>
</Form>
```

In your `onCreate` function, you can now access the value of the switch using `values.chargable`. This will return `true` if the switch is checked and `false` if it's not.

```jsx
const onCreate = (values) => {
  console.log(values.chargable); // true or false
}
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The code you provided seems correct. The `Switch` component is correctly placed inside a `Form.Item` and the `valuePropName` is set to "checked" which is the correct prop for a `Switch` component.

The `onCreate` function should receive an object with the values of the form fields. The key of each value is the `name` prop of the corresponding `Form.Item`. In your case, the `Switch` value should be under the key "switch".

Here is an example of how you can use the values inside the `onCreate` function:

```jsx
const onCreate = (values) => {
  console.log('Received values from form: ', values);
  console.log('Switch value: ', values.switch);
}
```

If you are not receiving the value from the switch, it might be because the `Switch` component is not being triggered or the form is not being submitted correctly. Make sure that the `Switch` component is working as expected (you can test it by adding an `onChange` prop and logging the value) and that the form submission is working correctly.

If you are still having issues, please provide more details about the problem and I'll be glad to help you further.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The code you posted seems to be correct. The `Switch` component is inside a `Form.Item` and its value should be included in the `values` object when the form is submitted.

However, you might want to check a few things:

1. Make sure that the `onCreate` function is correctly receiving the form values. You can do this by logging the `values` object to the console:

```javascript
const onCreate = (values) => {
  console.log(values);
}
```

2. Check if the `Switch` component is correctly updating its value when toggled. You can do this by adding an `onChange` handler to the `Switch` component:

```javascript
<Switch checkedChildren="Yes" unCheckedChildren="No" onChange={(checked) => console.log(checked)} />
```

3. Make sure that the `name` prop of the `Form.Item` that wraps the `Switch` component is unique and not used by any other form item.

If you've checked all of these and the problem still persists, it might be a good idea to create a minimal, reproducible example and ask for help on a platform like StackOverflow.
