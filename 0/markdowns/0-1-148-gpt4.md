I recently started to give tailwind.css a try in my Nuxt project. so I needed to use `:not(:last-child)` pseudo-elements but I didn't find how.

```
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```


I want to add a border-bottom to all of the `<li>` except the last one.

I know Tailwind has [first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants/#first-child-v1-1-0) & [last](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants/#last-child-v1-1-0) pseudo-class variant but I can't use them with `:not()`

In Tailwind CSS, you can use the `last:` variant to target the last child of a container. However, the `:not()` pseudo-class is not directly supported. 

To achieve the effect of `:not(:last-child)`, you can apply the border to all elements and then remove it from the last one. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `border-b` applies a bottom border to all `<li>` elements, and `last:border-b-0` removes the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. 

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your tailwind.config.js file if it's not already enabled:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

This will allow you to use the `last:` variant with the `borderWidth` utility.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

In Tailwind CSS, you can use the `last:` variant to target the last child of a container. However, it doesn't support the `:not()` pseudo-class directly. 

To achieve the desired effect, you can apply the border to all `<li>` elements and then remove it from the last one. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `last:border-b-0` removes the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. 

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your `tailwind.config.js` file for this to work:

```js
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this configuration, you need to rebuild your project for the changes to take effect.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use the `space-y-*` utility classes from Tailwind CSS to add space between your elements, which will also add a border between them. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul class="space-y-1">
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `space-y-1` adds a 0.25rem space between each `<li>`. The border will appear in this space, effectively creating a border between each item, but not after the last one.

If you want to use the `:not(:last-child)` pseudo-class, you would need to write custom CSS because Tailwind does not support this pseudo-class directly. Here's how you can do it:

```css
li:not(:last-child) {
  @apply border-solid border-b border-black;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="not-last-border"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

This will apply the border to all `<li>` elements except the last one.
