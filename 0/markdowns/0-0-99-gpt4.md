I'm having trouble getting the Angular 5 Validators.pattern to work. I've tried every regex that SHOULD normally work, but it's not working. I read that Validators.pattern requires a different format, but I can't seem to find it...

Any ideas what the Validators.pattern should be to

(1) allow only numbers, positive and negative

and 

(2) allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places

Valid examples would be: 
1
1.2
1.22
-21
-21.48

Anything with any letter in it would be invalid.

Thanks for your help!

Sure, I can help with that. 

For Angular Validators.pattern, you can use regular expressions (regex) to validate the input. 

(1) To allow only numbers, positive and negative, you can use the following regex:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^-?[0-9]\d*(\.\d+)?$/)
```

(2) To allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places, you can use the following regex:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^-?[0-9]\d*(\.\d{1,2})?$/)
```

Here is a breakdown of the regex:

- `^-?` allows for an optional negative sign at the beginning.
- `[0-9]\d*` allows for at least one digit.
- `(\.\d+)?` allows for an optional decimal followed by one or more digits.
- `(\.\d{1,2})?` allows for an optional decimal followed by one or two digits.

Remember to import Validators from @angular/forms in your component:

```javascript
import { Validators } from '@angular/forms';
```

And then you can use it in your form control:

```javascript
this.myForm = this.fb.group({
  myNumber: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.pattern(/^-?[0-9]\d*(\.\d{1,2})?$/)]]
});
```

This will ensure that the input is a number, optionally with up to 2 decimal places.

Sure, I can help with that. 

Angular's Validators.pattern uses JavaScript's RegExp object under the hood, so any regular expression that works with JavaScript should work with Validators.pattern.

Here's how you can create the patterns:

1) To allow only numbers, positive and negative:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+$/)
```

2) To allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$/)
```

Here's what these patterns do:

- `^` asserts start of a line
- `[-]?` allows an optional `-` at the start for negative numbers
- `[0-9]+` allows one or more digits
- `(\.[0-9]{1,2})?` allows an optional decimal point followed by one or two digits
- `$` asserts end of a line

These patterns should work for your use case. Let me know if you have any other questions!

In Angular, you can use the Validators.pattern to validate form inputs against a regular expression. Here's how you can do it for your requirements:

1) To allow only numbers, positive and negative:

```typescript
this.form = this.fb.group({
  number: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+$/)]]
});
```

This regular expression `^[-]?[0-9]+$` will match any string that starts with an optional negative sign, followed by one or more digits, and ends there.

2) To allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places:

```typescript
this.form = this.fb.group({
  number: ['', [Validators.required, Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$/)]]
});
```

This regular expression `^[-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$` will match any string that starts with an optional negative sign, followed by one or more digits, and optionally followed by a decimal point and one or two digits, and ends there.

Please note that the `Validators.pattern` function in Angular takes a string as input, not a RegExp object. So you should not use slashes `/` at the start and end of the pattern.
