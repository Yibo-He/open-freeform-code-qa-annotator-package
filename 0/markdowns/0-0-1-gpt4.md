I have a NextJS app without an integrated api that I want to deploy to Vercel. It works fine when I run it locally `yarn run dev` and I can also build it `yarn run build` without any errors. When I deploy it Vercel, however, I receive a `404 Error`.
Here is my folder structure:
```
app/
  - components
  - pages
    - editor
      - [id].tsx
    ...tsx
  - public
  - utils
    - db
      api.ts
```

I am using NextJs 10.0.3.
Here is a link to the deployed [app](https://clubhouse-bio-2qgg4rvij.vercel.app).
I don't have a nextjs config file. My assumption is that the error is caused by the dynamic route but I can't find my mistake. Also, no page is working when the app is deployed as opposed to only the dynamic page.
Do you have pointers on where to look next?
EDIT 1:
[Here](https://github.com/JanRuettinger/ClubhouseBio) is a link to the GitHub repo.
EDIT 2:
I found an issue but don't know how to fix it.
This is how my build output looks like on Vercel:

This is how it's supposed to look like on Vercel:

Not sure why the whole `_next` folder is missing.

The issue seems to be related to the way Vercel handles deployments. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your Vercel settings:** Make sure you have set up your Vercel project correctly. The "Build Command" should be `yarn build` or `npm run build` and the "Output Directory" should be `.next`.

2. **Inspect the build logs:** Check the build logs in Vercel to see if there are any errors or warnings that could be causing the issue.

3. **Check your package.json scripts:** Make sure your `build` script in `package.json` is set to `next build`.

4. **Check your dynamic routes:** Make sure your dynamic routes are correctly configured. In your case, the file `[id].tsx` should be inside a `pages` directory.

5. **Try a clean deployment:** Sometimes, cached files can cause issues. Try to make a clean deployment by removing the `.next` and `node_modules` directories, then reinstalling the dependencies and building the project again.

6. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date. You can do this by running `yarn install` or `npm install`.

If none of these suggestions work, you might want to consider reaching out to Vercel support or asking for help in the Next.js community.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to the way Vercel handles Next.js routing. 

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check your routes:** Make sure all your routes are correctly defined in your Next.js application. Remember that Next.js uses a file-based router built on the concept of pages. When a file is added to the `pages` directory it's automatically available as a route.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** In your case, you're using dynamic routes (`[id].tsx`). Make sure you're using the `getStaticPaths` function to specify which paths Next.js should pre-render at build time. If you're using `getServerSideProps` or `getInitialProps` instead, it might cause issues with Vercel.

3. **Check your build command:** Make sure you're using the correct build command in your Vercel settings. For a Next.js application, it should be `npm run build` or `yarn build`.

4. **Check your output directory:** By default, Next.js will output your build to the `.next` directory. Make sure this is not being ignored in your `.gitignore` or `.vercelignore` files.

5. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed and up-to-date. Sometimes, a missing or outdated dependency can cause issues with the build process.

6. **Check your logs:** Vercel provides detailed logs of your build process. Check these logs for any errors or warnings that might indicate what's going wrong.

If none of these suggestions help, you might want to consider reaching out to Vercel's support or checking their documentation for more information.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to the way Vercel handles routing for Next.js applications. 

Vercel automatically provides a `vercel.json` configuration file for Next.js applications. This file is used to configure the routing behavior of the application when it's deployed. If you don't provide a `vercel.json` file in your project, Vercel will use a default configuration.

The `404 Error` you're seeing might be due to a misconfiguration in the routing rules. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your `package.json` file:** Make sure that your `build` script in `package.json` is set to `next build`. This is the command that Vercel uses to build your application.

2. **Check your dynamic routes:** Dynamic routes in Next.js should be named with square brackets, like `[id].tsx`. Make sure that your dynamic routes are correctly named and that they are correctly importing and exporting their components.

3. **Add a `vercel.json` file:** You can add a `vercel.json` file to your project to manually configure the routing rules. Here's an example of what this file might look like for your project:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "package.json",
      "use": "@vercel/next"
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This configuration tells Vercel to route all requests to the corresponding file in your Next.js application.

4. **Check your dependencies:** Make sure that all your dependencies are correctly installed and that they are compatible with the version of Next.js you're using.

5. **Check your build output:** The `_next` folder is generated during the build process and it contains the built version of your application. If this folder is missing, it means that the build process failed. Check the build logs in Vercel for any error messages.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your application, such as the code for your dynamic routes and the build logs from Vercel.
