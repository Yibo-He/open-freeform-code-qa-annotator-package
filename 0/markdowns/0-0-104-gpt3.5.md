I'm using the `Button` component from React Native and I need to change the color of the button when the button is focused with a TV remote (Amazon Fire Stick). I don't see any focus listeners available for the button. Is there anyway to achieve this functionality? Here is my code:
```
<Button disabled={props.loading} styles={styles.button} title="1" onPress={() => {props.addNumber(1)}}/>
```

I looked at the `TouchableHighlight` component but it won't work because I need the color to change when the user has focused on the button before the button is clicked. By default, the opacity change is so small that it's hard to tell the button is currently focused.

You can use the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component to achieve this functionality. Here is an example code snippet:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableWithoutFeedback } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = () => {
  const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    setIsFocused(true);
  };

  const handleBlur = () => {
    setIsFocused(false);
  };

  return (
    <TouchableWithoutFeedback
      onFocus={handleFocus}
      onBlur={handleBlur}
      onPress={() => console.log('Button pressed')}
    >
      <View
        style={{
          backgroundColor: isFocused ? 'blue' : 'red',
          padding: 10,
          borderRadius: 5,
        }}
      >
        <Text style={{ color: 'white' }}>My Button</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
  );
};

export default MyButton;
```

In this example, we are using the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component to wrap our button content. We are also using the `useState` hook to keep track of whether the button is currently focused or not.

We then use the `onFocus` and `onBlur` props of the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component to update the `isFocused` state when the button gains or loses focus.

Finally, we use the `isFocused` state to conditionally style the button with a blue background color when it is focused and a red background color when it is not focused.

You can customize this code to fit your specific use case.

You can achieve this functionality by using the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component instead of the `Button` component. The `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component allows you to handle touch events and focus events separately. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { TouchableWithoutFeedback, Text, View } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = (props) => {
  const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    setIsFocused(true);
  };

  const handleBlur = () => {
    setIsFocused(false);
  };

  return (
    <TouchableWithoutFeedback
      onFocus={handleFocus}
      onBlur={handleBlur}
      onPress={props.onPress}
    >
      <View style={[styles.button, isFocused && styles.focusedButton]}>
        <Text>{props.title}</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
  );
};

const styles = {
  button: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
  },
  focusedButton: {
    backgroundColor: 'red',
  },
};

export default MyButton;
```

In this example, we're using the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component to wrap our custom button component. We're also using the `useState` hook to keep track of whether the button is currently focused or not. When the button is focused, we set the `isFocused` state to `true`, and when it loses focus, we set the state to `false`. 

We're also using the `styles` object to define the styles for our button and the focused button. When the button is focused, we apply the `focusedButton` style to change the background color to red.

You can use this `MyButton` component in your code like this:

```
<MyButton title="1" onPress={() => {props.addNumber(1)}}/>
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

You can achieve this functionality by using the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component and handling the `onFocus` and `onBlur` events. Here's an example:

```
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { TouchableWithoutFeedback, View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyButton = (props) => {
  const [isFocused, setIsFocused] = useState(false);

  const handleFocus = () => {
    setIsFocused(true);
  };

  const handleBlur = () => {
    setIsFocused(false);
  };

  return (
    <TouchableWithoutFeedback onFocus={handleFocus} onBlur={handleBlur} onPress={props.onPress}>
      <View style={[styles.button, isFocused && styles.focusedButton]}>
        <Text style={styles.buttonText}>{props.title}</Text>
      </View>
    </TouchableWithoutFeedback>
  );
};

const styles = {
  button: {
    backgroundColor: '#ccc',
    padding: 10,
    borderRadius: 5,
    margin: 10,
  },
  focusedButton: {
    backgroundColor: 'blue',
  },
  buttonText: {
    color: '#fff',
    textAlign: 'center',
  },
};

export default MyButton;
```

In this example, we're using the `TouchableWithoutFeedback` component to wrap our button content. We're also using the `useState` hook to keep track of whether the button is currently focused or not.

When the button is focused, the `handleFocus` function is called and we update the `isFocused` state to `true`. Similarly, when the button loses focus, the `handleBlur` function is called and we update the `isFocused` state to `false`.

Finally, we're using the `isFocused` state to conditionally apply a different style to the button when it's focused. In this example, we're changing the background color to blue.

You can customize the styles to fit your needs.
