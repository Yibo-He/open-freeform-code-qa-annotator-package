Let's say I have a `div` in the DOM with `'200px'` of width and a `class` of `'target'`.
In order to test its width with cypress, I should write the code below:
```
cy.get('.target').should('have.css', 'width', '200px');
```

and there's a bunch of tests, testing widths and heights of elements...
...
Today something weird happened!
All these tests have failed because the value of `width` that cypress found was `200.0000000000032038879956012px` instead of `200px` !!!
The first solution that came into my mind was to test them on the actual numbers (ex, `200`), instead of the string (ex, `'200px'`) that the cypress found; which I think is an expensive idea!

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

One solution to this problem is to use Cypress's `within` command to get the `div` element and then use JavaScript's `parseFloat` function to convert the value of `width` to a number with a specified number of decimal places. Here's an example:

```
cy.get('.target').within(() => {
  cy.get('div').should(($div) => {
    const width = parseFloat($div.css('width')).toFixed(2);
    expect(width).to.equal('200.00');
  });
});
```

In this example, we're using the `within` command to scope the search for the `div` element to the `.target` element. Then, we're using the `should` command with a callback function that receives the `div` element as an argument. Inside the callback function, we're using the `css` function to get the value of the `width` property and then using `parseFloat` to convert it to a number. Finally, we're using the `toFixed` function to round the number to two decimal places and comparing it to the expected value of `'200.00'`. This should ensure that the test passes even if the actual value of `width` has some extra decimal places.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

One solution to this problem is to use the `closeTo` assertion instead of the exact value assertion. The `closeTo` assertion allows you to check if a value is within a certain range of another value. 

For example, instead of checking for `'200px'`, you can check for a value that is within a certain range of `200`. Here's an example:

```
cy.get('.target').should(($div) => {
  const width = parseFloat($div.css('width'));
  expect(width).to.be.closeTo(200, 0.5);
});
```

In this example, we're using the `parseFloat` function to convert the string value of `width` to a number. Then, we're using the `closeTo` assertion to check if the value is within 0.5 of `200`. This allows for a small margin of error in case of rounding issues.

You can adjust the range value (0.5 in this example) based on your specific needs and the expected margin of error.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

One solution to this issue is to use Cypress' `within` command to get the width of the element relative to its parent element. This can help avoid issues with decimal places and ensure that the width is being measured accurately.

Here's an example:

```
cy.get('.parent')
  .within(() => {
    cy.get('.target').should('have.css', 'width', '200px');
  });
```

In this example, we're using the `within` command to scope the search for the `.target` element to its parent element with the class `.parent`. This ensures that the width is being measured relative to the parent element, which can help avoid issues with decimal places.

Another solution is to use Cypress' `round` command to round the width value to a specific number of decimal places. For example:

```
cy.get('.target')
  .invoke('width')
  .should('be.closeTo', 200, 0.01);
```

In this example, we're using the `invoke` command to get the raw width value of the `.target` element, and then using the `be.closeTo` assertion to check that it's within 0.01 of the expected value of 200. This can help avoid issues with decimal places by rounding the value to a specific number of decimal places.
