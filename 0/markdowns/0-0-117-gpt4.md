I quick question!
I have a webapp that only fetches data from an API so i dont have i backend part. My question is where do you keep your API key? Accordingly to React docs you should not store API keys in the app so how do you manage this when you have an webapp that consumes an API and you have to use the API key in your get requests?

Storing API keys directly in your client-side code is not recommended due to security reasons. If you don't have a backend for your webapp, you can't store your API keys there. However, there are a few alternatives you can consider:

1. **Environment Variables:** You can store your API keys in environment variables on the machine where your app runs. This is a common practice and most hosting platforms support it. However, this method is not completely secure as the keys can still be exposed through the browser's developer tools.

2. **Netlify Functions or Vercel Serverless Functions:** If you're using a platform like Netlify or Vercel, you can use their serverless functions feature. You can create a function that fetches data from the API and returns it to the client. The API key would be stored as an environment variable on Netlify or Vercel, not in your app.

3. **Proxy Server:** You can set up a simple proxy server that handles API requests for your app. The API key would be stored on the server. This is more secure, but it requires more setup and maintenance.

4. **Third-Party Secure Storage Services:** There are services like AWS Secrets Manager or Azure Key Vault that provide secure storage for sensitive information like API keys.

Remember, no matter where you store your API keys, you should always limit their scope as much as possible, and rotate them regularly.

Storing API keys directly in your client-side code is indeed a bad practice as it exposes your keys to the public. Since you don't have a backend for your webapp, you can't store your API keys there. 

Here are a few options you can consider:

1. **Environment Variables**: You can store your API keys in environment variables on the machine where your app runs. This is a common practice and it's supported by many hosting platforms like Netlify, Vercel, etc. However, this method still exposes your API key in the network request from client-side to the API server.

2. **Serverless Functions**: You can use serverless functions (like AWS Lambda, Netlify Functions, Vercel Functions, etc.) to create a simple backend for your app. These functions can store your API keys securely and make requests to the API on behalf of your app. This way, your API keys are never exposed to the client-side.

3. **Proxy Server**: Similar to serverless functions, you can set up a simple proxy server that stores your API keys and makes requests to the API. This can be a small Express.js app, for example.

4. **Third-Party Secure Storage**: You can use a third-party service to securely store your API keys. These services provide an API that your app can use to access the keys. However, this method also exposes your keys in the network request.

Remember, the goal is to prevent your API keys from being exposed in the client-side code or in network requests that can be inspected by users. The best solution depends on your specific needs and the resources available to you.

Storing API keys directly in your client-side code is indeed a bad practice as it exposes your keys to the public. Here are a few ways to manage API keys in a secure manner:

1. **Environment Variables**: You can store your API keys in environment variables on the server that is serving your React app. You can then access these variables in your code. This is a common practice and is secure because the keys are not exposed in your code and they are not accessible via the browser. However, this method is only applicable if you have control over the server environment.

2. **Proxy Server**: If you don't have a backend for your app, you can create a simple proxy server that handles the API calls. The proxy server stores the API keys and makes the API requests on behalf of the client. The client sends a request to the proxy server, the proxy server makes the API request, and then sends the data back to the client. This way, the API keys are never exposed to the client.

3. **Serverless Functions**: If setting up a proxy server seems too much, you can use serverless functions like AWS Lambda or Netlify Functions. These functions can hold your API keys and make the API calls. Your React app would call these functions instead of calling the API directly.

4. **Secure Key Management Services**: You can use secure key management services like AWS Secrets Manager or Google Cloud Secret Manager to store and manage your API keys. These services provide a secure and convenient way to manage API keys and other sensitive information.

Remember, no matter which method you choose, never expose your API keys in the client-side code or in version control systems like Git.
