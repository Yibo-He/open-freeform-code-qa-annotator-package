I used [nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder](https://github.com/nklayman/vue-cli-plugin-electron-builder) to create an electron app prepared with Vue/Vuex. It ships with files `main.js`, `background.js` including Vue component starting point. But I can't get the events to work. My attempt below yields `Uncaught ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined` when rendering (compile is fine).
Component: Splash.vue
```
<template>
    <div @click="open">open</div>      
</template>

<script>

const { ipcMain } = require('electron')

export default {
    methods: {
        open()
        {
            ipcMain.on('my-open-event', (event, arg) => {
                console.log(event, arg)
            })
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

background.js
```
import { app, protocol, BrowserWindow } from 'electron'

...

app.on('my-open-event', async () => {
    try {
        "Will call some executable here";
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
    }
})
```

main.js
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import store from './store'

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  store,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

Full error:
```
Uncaught ReferenceError: __dirname is not defined

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?

The error you're seeing is because you're trying to use `ipcMain` in a renderer process (Vue component). The `ipcMain` module cannot be used directly from the renderer process (Vue component). It is an instance of `EventEmitter` and it's a module used to communicate asynchronously from the main process to renderer processes.

In Electron, there are two types of processes:

1. Main Process: In Electron, the process that runs `package.json`'s `main` script is called the main process. The main process can display a GUI by creating web pages.

2. Renderer Process: Since Electron uses Chromium for displaying web pages, Chromium's multi-process architecture is also used. Each web page in Electron runs in its own process, which is called the renderer process.

In your case, the Vue component is running in the renderer process and you're trying to use `ipcMain` which is available only in the main process. To communicate from the renderer process to the main process, you should use `ipcRenderer`.

Here's how you can fix your code:

Component: Splash.vue
```
<template>
    <div @click="open">open</div>      
</template>

<script>
const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron')

export default {
    methods: {
        open()
        {
            ipcRenderer.send('my-open-event', 'your argument here');
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

background.js
```
import { app, protocol, BrowserWindow, ipcMain } from 'electron'

...

ipcMain.on('my-open-event', (event, arg) => {
    try {
        console.log(arg); // prints "your argument here"
        "Will call some executable here";
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
    }
})
```

main.js
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import store from './store'

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  store,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

In the above code, when you click on the div in `Splash.vue`, it sends an event 'my-open-event' to the main process. The main process listens for 'my-open-event' and executes the code in the callback.

The issue here is that you're trying to use `ipcMain` in the renderer process (Vue component), while it should be used in the main process (Electron's main process). 

In Electron, there are two types of processes: 

1. The Main process - which can make use of all Node.js APIs and Electron's APIs. It's responsible for creating windows in GUI-based desktop applications. The script that runs the Main process is usually named `main.js`.

2. The Renderer process - which is a web page running in its own process. Each web page in Electron runs in its own process, which is called the Renderer process. The Renderer process can use a subset of the Node.js APIs.

`ipcMain` is an instance of the EventEmitter class. When used in the Main process, it handles asynchronous and synchronous messages sent from a renderer process (web page). Messages sent from a renderer will be emitted to this module.

On the other hand, `ipcRenderer` is an instance of the EventEmitter class. It provides a few methods that can communicate synchronously and asynchronously from the renderer process (web page) to the main process.

In your case, you should use `ipcRenderer` in your Vue component to send events to the main process, and `ipcMain` in the main process to listen to those events.

Here's how you can do it:

Component: Splash.vue
```javascript
<template>
    <div @click="open">open</div>      
</template>

<script>
const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron')

export default {
    methods: {
        open() {
            ipcRenderer.send('my-open-event', 'some argument');
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

background.js
```javascript
import { app, protocol, BrowserWindow, ipcMain } from 'electron'

...

ipcMain.on('my-open-event', (event, arg) => {
    try {
        console.log(arg) // prints "some argument"
        // "Will call some executable here";
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
    }
})
```

This way, when you click on the div in your Vue component, it will send an event named 'my-open-event' to the main process, which will be listening for this event and execute the code in the callback function.

Also, please note that `__dirname` is a Node.js global variable that gets the directory name of the current module. It seems like you're trying to use it in the renderer process, which is a common source of confusion. In Electron, Node.js globals are not available in the renderer process unless `nodeIntegration` is set to `true`. However, enabling `nodeIntegration` is not recommended for security reasons. Instead, you can use `preload` scripts to selectively enable features in the renderer process.

The issue you are facing is because you are trying to use `ipcMain` in the renderer process (Vue component). `ipcMain` is only available in the main process. In the renderer process, you should use `ipcRenderer`.

Here is how you can fix your code:

Component: Splash.vue
```
<template>
    <div @click="open">open</div>      
</template>

<script>

const { ipcRenderer } = require('electron')

export default {
    methods: {
        open()
        {
            ipcRenderer.send('my-open-event', 'some argument');
        }
    }
}
</script>
```

background.js
```
import { app, protocol, BrowserWindow, ipcMain } from 'electron'

...

ipcMain.on('my-open-event', async (event, arg) => {
    try {
        console.log(arg); // prints "some argument"
        // "Will call some executable here";
    } catch (e) {
        console.error(e)
    }
})
```

main.js
```
import Vue from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import store from './store'

Vue.config.productionTip = false

new Vue({
  store,
  render: h => h(App)
}).$mount('#app')
```

In this way, when you click on the div in your Splash.vue component, it will send 'my-open-event' to the main process, which will be caught in your background.js file. 

Also, please note that `__dirname` is not available in the renderer process when using webpack. If you need to use it, you can use `__static` instead, which is a global variable pointing to the public directory.
