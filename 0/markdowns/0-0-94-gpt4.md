So I try to find the minimum and maximum if an array and want to call the function. I made this code, but it doesn´t work. I just don´t get why.
```
function getMinMax(arr){
  let maximum = Math.max(arr);
  let minimum = Math.min(arr);
 let result =  ([maximum, minimum]); 
  return result;
};

getMinMax([10,3,8,1,33])
```

The issue with your code is that `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` do not accept an array as an argument. They expect individual numbers as arguments. You can use the spread operator (`...`) to pass elements of an array as arguments to a function. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
function getMinMax(arr){
  let maximum = Math.max(...arr);
  let minimum = Math.min(...arr);
  let result =  [maximum, minimum]; 
  return result;
};

console.log(getMinMax([10,3,8,1,33])); // it will log: [33, 1]
```

In this code, `...arr` spreads out the array into individual elements, so it's as if you're calling `Math.max(10, 3, 8, 1, 33)` and `Math.min(10, 3, 8, 1, 33)`, which is the correct usage of these functions.

The issue with your code is that `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions do not accept an array as an argument. They expect individual numbers as arguments. 

To solve this, you can use the spread operator (`...`) to pass elements of the array as individual arguments to these functions. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
function getMinMax(arr){
  let maximum = Math.max(...arr);
  let minimum = Math.min(...arr);
  let result =  [maximum, minimum]; 
  return result;
};

console.log(getMinMax([10,3,8,1,33])); // it will log: [33, 1]
```

In this code, `...arr` spreads the array into individual elements, so `Math.max(...arr)` and `Math.min(...arr)` are equivalent to `Math.max(10,3,8,1,33)` and `Math.min(10,3,8,1,33)`, respectively.

The issue with your code is that `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` functions do not accept an array as an argument. They accept a list of numbers. You can use the spread operator (`...`) to pass elements of an array as arguments to these functions. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
function getMinMax(arr){
  let maximum = Math.max(...arr);
  let minimum = Math.min(...arr);
  let result =  [maximum, minimum]; 
  return result;
};

console.log(getMinMax([10,3,8,1,33])); // it will log: [33, 1]
```

The spread operator (`...`) is used to pass elements of an array as arguments to a function. It spreads out the array into individual elements. So, `Math.max(...arr)` is equivalent to `Math.max(10, 3, 8, 1, 33)` in your case.
