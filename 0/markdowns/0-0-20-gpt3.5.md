I just read in the `styled-components` [documentation](https://www.styled-components.com/docs/basics#passed-props) that the following is wrong and it will affect render times. If that is the case, how can I refactor the code and use the required props to create a dynamic style?

Thank you in advance.



```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
    const TabWrapper = styled.li`
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    padding: 100px;
    margin: 1px;
    font-size: 3em;
    color: ${props => (isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
    background-color: ${props => (isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
    cursor: ${props => (isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

    return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}


export default Tab
```

The issue with the current implementation is that a new styled component is created every time the `Tab` component is rendered. This can lead to performance issues as it creates unnecessary re-renders.

To fix this, you can move the styled component outside the `Tab` component and pass the required props as arguments to the styled component. Here's an example:

```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper isSelected={isSelected} onClick={onClick}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this implementation, the `TabWrapper` styled component is defined outside the `Tab` component and the required props are passed as arguments to the styled component. This ensures that the styled component is only created once and the required props are used to create a dynamic style.

The issue with the current implementation is that the `styled.li` component is being created inside the functional component `Tab`. This means that every time `Tab` is rendered, a new `styled.li` component is created, which can lead to performance issues.

To refactor the code and use the required props to create a dynamic style, you can move the `styled.li` component outside of the `Tab` component and pass the required props as arguments to the styled component. Here's an example:

```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, the `TabWrapper` component is defined outside of the `Tab` component, and the required props (`isSelected`) are passed as arguments to the styled component. In the `Tab` component, the `TabWrapper` component is used and the `isSelected` prop is passed to it. This way, the `styled.li` component is only created once and the required props are used to create a dynamic style.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue with the current implementation is that a new styled component is created every time the `Tab` component is rendered. This can negatively impact performance, especially if the `Tab` component is used frequently.

To fix this, you can move the styled component outside of the `Tab` component and pass the required props as arguments to the styled component. Here's an example:

```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this updated implementation, the `TabWrapper` styled component is defined outside of the `Tab` component. The required props (`isSelected`) are passed as arguments to the styled component, and the `Tab` component simply renders the `TabWrapper` component with the required props. This way, the styled component is only created once and can be reused multiple times without negatively impacting performance.
