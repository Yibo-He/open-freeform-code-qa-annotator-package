I used [this article](https://css-tricks.com/practical-css-scroll-snapping/) as a point of reference, in particular [this working snippet](https://codepen.io/maxakohler/pen/KBKNxd), but in my page (the script below) the vertical snap scrolling isn't working. Why?
```
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: mandatory;
  scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```
```
<div class="parent row">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

The CSS you've written seems to be correct for vertical scroll snapping. However, the issue might be that you're missing the CSS property `overflow-y: scroll;` in your `.parent` class. This property is necessary to enable scrolling within the parent element.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

Also, note that `scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);` is not necessary and is not currently supported in any major browsers. The `scroll-snap-type: mandatory;` is also redundant and can be removed, as you've already defined `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;` afterwards.

The issue is likely due to the `row` class in your parent div. The CSS you've written is for vertical scrolling, but the `row` class (which is commonly used in frameworks like Bootstrap) is typically used for horizontal layouts.

If you're using a CSS framework that defines `row` as a horizontal layout, it may be overriding your vertical scroll settings. Try removing the `row` class from your parent div:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

Also, you have a redundant `scroll-snap-type` property in your `.parent` class. You can remove `scroll-snap-type: mandatory;` because `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;` is enough for vertical scrolling.

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
```

If you want to keep the `row` class for some reason, you need to make sure it doesn't conflict with your vertical scroll settings.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue is that you're using the class "row" in your parent div. This class is commonly used in CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and it applies a flexbox layout, making the children elements arrange in a row (horizontal) instead of a column (vertical). 

If you want to use scroll snapping vertically, you should make sure the children elements are arranged in a column. So, you should remove the "row" class from the parent div, or if you need it for other styling purposes, override the flexbox layout by adding `flex-direction: column;` to your `.parent` class.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

And the HTML:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

This should make your scroll snapping work as expected.
