Angular 6 has new CLI command `ng add <package>`.

How can I remove the package using Angular CLI?

UPDATE

[documentation](https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4)

> `ng add` will use your package manager to download new dependencies and invoke an installation script (implemented as a schematic) which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies (e.g. polyfills), or scaffold package-specific initialization code

It is not the same `npm install <package>`

I was trying to use `ng rm` but it is not working yet.

The Angular CLI does not currently provide a command to remove packages added with `ng add`. The `ng add` command not only installs the package but also invokes an installation script which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies, or scaffold package-specific initialization code. 

To remove a package added with `ng add`, you would need to:

1. Use npm or yarn to uninstall the package. For npm, you would use the command `npm uninstall <package>`. For yarn, you would use the command `yarn remove <package>`.

2. Manually undo any changes to your project that were made by the package's installation script. This could involve modifying configuration files, removing additional dependencies, or deleting scaffolded code. The specifics would depend on what the package's installation script does.

3. If the package added any new scripts to your `package.json` file, you would also need to manually remove those.

Remember to replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to remove.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Angular CLI does not provide a direct command to remove a package added using `ng add`. However, you can manually remove the package by following these steps:

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Find the package you want to remove in the `dependencies` section.
3. Delete the line that contains the package.
4. Save the `package.json` file.
5. Run `npm install` in your terminal. This will update your `node_modules` folder based on the changes you made in the `package.json` file.

Please note that this will only remove the package from your dependencies. If the `ng add` command made other modifications to your project (like adding files or modifying existing ones), you will need to manually revert those changes.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The Angular CLI does not currently provide a direct command to remove packages added via `ng add`. However, you can manually remove the package by following these steps:

1. Remove the package from your `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm uninstall <package>` or `yarn remove <package>` (depending on your package manager) in your terminal to remove the package from your `node_modules` folder and update your `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
3. If the package added any additional configuration to your project (e.g., in your `angular.json` file or elsewhere), you'll need to manually remove or revert those changes.
4. If the package added any import statements in your project files, you'll need to remove those as well.

Remember to replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to remove.

Please note that this process can be error-prone, especially if the package made extensive modifications to your project. Always make sure to have a backup or use version control so you can revert changes if necessary.
