It seems like you've accidentally left out some details in your question. Specifically, you mentioned that you get a "below command" when you do `npm -v`, but you didn't actually provide the output or error message you're seeing. 

However, I can provide some general advice for troubleshooting npm installation issues:

1. **Reinstall Node.js and npm**: Sometimes, the easiest solution is to just uninstall and then reinstall Node.js and npm. You can uninstall with `sudo apt-get remove nodejs` and `sudo apt-get remove npm`, and then reinstall with `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs`.

2. **Use a Node Version Manager**: Node Version Manager (nvm) is a tool that allows you to easily install, update and switch between different versions of Node.js. To install nvm, you can use the following command: `curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash`. Then, you can install Node.js with `nvm install node`.

3. **Check your PATH**: The `whereis` command you mentioned can be used to check if Node.js and npm are correctly installed in a directory that's included in your system's PATH. The output of `whereis node` and `whereis npm` should point to the directories where Node.js and npm are installed, respectively. If they're not in your PATH, you can add them with `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/node` and `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/npm`.

4. **Check permissions**: If you're seeing an EACCES error, it means you don't have the necessary permissions to install npm packages. You can fix this by either using a Node version manager like nvm, or by changing the permissions of your .npm directory with `sudo chown -R $(whoami) ~/.npm`.

If none of these solutions work, please provide the exact error message you're seeing when you run `npm -v`, and I'll be able to give more specific advice.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

It seems like you've forgotten to include the error message you get when you run `npm -v`. However, if you've installed Node.js but npm is not working, it's possible that npm was not installed correctly or at all.

Here are some steps you can try to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall nodejs and npm:
   ```
   sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
   ```

2. Clean npm cache:
   ```
   sudo npm cache clean -f
   ```

3. Install nvm (Node Version Manager). It will allow you to install any version of Node.js along with npm:
   ```
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

4. Close terminal and open it again. Verify that nvm is installed by typing:
   ```
   nvm --version
   ```

5. Now install Node.js using nvm:
   ```
   nvm install node
   ```

6. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed by typing:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

This should solve your issue. If it doesn't, please provide the error message you're getting when you run `npm -v`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

It seems like you're having trouble with npm not being installed or recognized in your system. You didn't provide the output of `npm -v` or `whereis` command, but I'll assume that they're not showing the expected results.

Here are a few steps you can follow to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall nodejs and npm:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nodejs
```

2. Update your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Reinstall nodejs and npm. The Node.js package is available in the NodeSource repository. You'll need to add it to your system to be able to install the latest Nodejs version.
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
This will install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository which should include the npm.

4. Verify the installation by checking their versions:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the error messages you're getting.
