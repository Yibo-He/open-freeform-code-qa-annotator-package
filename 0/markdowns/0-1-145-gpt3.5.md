I am using `truncate` in TailwindCSS to make text ellipsis if text-overflow more than one line but it does not work.
My code not works below:
```
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

It looks like you are using the correct class `truncate` in your code. However, the `truncate` class only works if the parent element has a fixed width. 

Try adding a width to the parent element like this:

```
<div className="ml-1 inline-block w-64">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, I added the `w-64` class to the parent element to give it a fixed width of 64 pixels. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.

The `truncate` class in TailwindCSS only works if the parent element has a fixed width. You can try adding a width to the parent element like this:
```
<div className="ml-1 inline-block w-40">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```
In this example, the parent element has a width of `40` which means the text will be truncated if it exceeds that width. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.

It looks like you are using the `truncate` class correctly in your code. However, the `truncate` class only works if the parent element has a fixed width. 

Try adding a fixed width to the parent element like this:

```
<div className="ml-1 inline-block w-40">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, I added the `w-40` class to the parent element to give it a fixed width of 40rem. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.
