I am beginner web developer. I have in my website accordion:  [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/)
and this code:
```
<div class="accordion pb-3" id="accordionExample">
                    <div class="accordion-item">
                        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
                            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
                                name and surname
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                        <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="background-color: red;">
                            <div class="accordion-body">
                                This is aółóźńthe first item's accordion body.It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
```

It's work fine. I would like to change the accordion arrow color to green. How can this be done?
Please help me

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To change the color of the accordion arrow, you can add the following CSS code to your website:

```
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This code will change the color of the arrow to green when the accordion is open. If you want to change the color of the arrow when the accordion is closed, you can add the following CSS code:

```
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    color: green;
}
```

Make sure to add this code to your CSS file or within a `<style>` tag in your HTML file.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To change the color of the accordion arrow, you can add the following CSS code to your website's stylesheet:

```
.accordion-button::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow icon that appears next to the accordion button. You can adjust the color to your desired shade of green by changing the value of the `color` property.

To change the color of the accordion arrow, you can add the following CSS code to your website's stylesheet:

```
.accordion-button:not(.collapsed)::after {
    color: green;
}
```

This code will change the color of the arrow to green when the accordion is open. If you want to change the color of the arrow when the accordion is closed, you can use the following code:

```
.accordion-button.collapsed::after {
    color: green;
}
```

Make sure to add this code after the Bootstrap CSS file is loaded, so that it overrides the default styles.
