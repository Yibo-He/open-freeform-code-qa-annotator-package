You can change the height of the `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by overriding the default CSS styles. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Add a CSS class to your `mat-form-field` in your HTML file:

```html
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="my-mat-form-field">
  <mat-label>Input</mat-label>
  <input matInput placeholder="Placeholder">
</mat-form-field>
```

2. In your CSS file, override the default styles:

```css
.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-wrapper {
  padding-bottom: 0;
}

.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-flex {
  padding: 0.5em 0.75em;  /* Adjust as needed */
}

.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-infix {
  border-top: 0;
}
```

The `padding-bottom` in `.mat-form-field-wrapper` is set to 0 to remove the extra space at the bottom of the form field.

The `padding` in `.mat-form-field-flex` is adjusted to reduce the overall height of the form field. You can adjust these values as needed.

The `border-top` in `.mat-form-field-infix` is set to 0 to remove the extra border at the top of the form field when it is not focused.

Please note that these styles are specific to the outlined appearance of `mat-form-field`. If you use a different appearance, you may need to adjust different styles.

Also, be aware that overriding the default styles may affect the look and feel of your form fields, and may cause issues with error messages, hints, and other features of `mat-form-field`. Always test thoroughly after making these changes.

You can change the height of `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by overriding the default CSS styles. Here's how you can do it:

1. In your CSS file, add the following styles:

```css
.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-wrapper {
  padding-bottom: 0.75em;
}

.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-flex {
  padding: 0.5em 0.75em;
}

.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-infix {
  border-top: 0.5px solid;
  padding: 0.25em 0;
}
```

2. If you want to apply these styles to a specific `mat-form-field`, you can add a class to it:

```html
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="my-form-field">
  <!-- your input here -->
</mat-form-field>
```

And then change your CSS to:

```css
.my-form-field.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-wrapper {
  padding-bottom: 0.75em;
}

.my-form-field.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-flex {
  padding: 0.5em 0.75em;
}

.my-form-field.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-infix {
  border-top: 0.5px solid;
  padding: 0.25em 0;
}
```

Please note that these values are just examples, you can adjust them according to your needs. Also, be aware that these styles might affect the layout of other elements in your form, so use them carefully.

You can change the height of the `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by overriding the default CSS styles. 

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```css
.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-wrapper {
  padding-bottom: 0.25em;
}

.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-flex {
  padding: 0.5em 0.75em;
}

.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-infix {
  border-top: 0.5em solid;
  padding: 0.25em 0;
}
```

In the above CSS, you can adjust the `padding` and `border-top` values to suit your needs. 

Please note that these styles should be placed in a global stylesheet, or you should use `::ng-deep` to force style encapsulation if you are placing them in a component's stylesheet.

Also, be aware that changing these styles might affect the alignment and layout of other form field elements (like labels, hints, errors), so you might need to adjust those as well.
