I am trying to update my Angular app from v5 to v6 following [this guide](https://update.angular.io/).

I have ran all these commands successfully:

```
npm install -g @angular/cli
npm install @angular/cli
ng update @angular/cli
```


The problem is that I get an error when running this command:

```
ng update @angular/core
                  Package "@angular/flex-layout" has an incompatible peer dependency to "rxjs" (requires "^5.5.0", would install "6.2.0").
                  Package "@angular/compiler-cli" has an incompatible peer dependency to "typescript" (requires ">=2.7.2 <2.8", would install "2.6.2")
Incompatible peer dependencies found. See above.
```


I am not sure how to handle this & I don't want to try things on my own to avoid breaking the app.

Can someone please advise what to do?

My current dependencies are as follows:

The error message is indicating that there are incompatible peer dependencies when trying to update `@angular/core`. This is because the packages `@angular/flex-layout` and `@angular/compiler-cli` require specific versions of `rxjs` and `typescript` respectively, which are different from the versions that would be installed by the update.

Here are the steps to resolve this:

1. Update `rxjs` to version 6. You can do this by running the command: `npm install rxjs@6`. This should resolve the issue with `@angular/flex-layout`.

2. Update `typescript` to a version that is compatible with `@angular/compiler-cli`. According to the error message, you need a version that is `>=2.7.2 <2.8`. You can do this by running the command: `npm install typescript@2.7.2`.

3. After updating these packages, try running the `ng update @angular/core` command again.

If you still encounter issues, you might need to update `@angular/flex-layout` and `@angular/compiler-cli` to versions that are compatible with Angular 6. You can do this by running the commands: `ng update @angular/flex-layout` and `ng update @angular/compiler-cli`.

Remember to backup your project before making these changes, just in case something goes wrong.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is indicating that there are incompatible peer dependencies. This means that some of the packages you're trying to update have dependencies on other packages, and the versions of those packages that would be installed by the update are not compatible with the versions required by the packages you're updating.

Here's how you can resolve this:

1. Update `rxjs` to version 6. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save rxjs@6
```

2. Angular 6 requires TypeScript version 2.7.x. However, your current version is 2.6.2. You can update TypeScript by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript@2.7.2
```

3. The `@angular/flex-layout` package has a peer dependency on `rxjs` version 5.5.0. However, Angular 6 uses `rxjs` version 6. You need to update `@angular/flex-layout` to a version that is compatible with `rxjs` version 6. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @angular/flex-layout@6.0.0-beta.15
```

After running these commands, try running the `ng update @angular/core` command again. It should now run without any errors.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that there are incompatible peer dependencies when trying to update Angular core. 

The first error is related to the `@angular/flex-layout` package, which requires `rxjs` version `^5.5.0`, but the update would install `rxjs` version `6.2.0`.

The second error is related to the `@angular/compiler-cli` package, which requires `typescript` version `>=2.7.2 <2.8`, but the update would install `typescript` version `2.6.2`.

Here are the steps to resolve these issues:

1. Update `rxjs` to version `6.x` using the following command:

    ```
    npm install --save rxjs@6
    ```

    Angular 6 uses `rxjs` version `6.x`. However, if you have code that uses `rxjs` version `5.x`, you might need to refactor your code or use `rxjs-compat`, which provides a compatibility layer between `rxjs` version `5.x` and `6.x`.

    ```
    npm install --save rxjs-compat
    ```

2. Update `typescript` to version `2.7.2` using the following command:

    ```
    npm install --save-dev typescript@2.7.2
    ```

    Angular 6 is compatible with `typescript` version `2.7.x`.

3. Update `@angular/flex-layout` to a version that is compatible with Angular 6:

    ```
    npm install --save @angular/flex-layout@6.0.0-beta.15
    ```

4. Now, you should be able to update Angular core:

    ```
    ng update @angular/core
    ```

Remember to test your application thoroughly after the update to ensure everything works as expected.
