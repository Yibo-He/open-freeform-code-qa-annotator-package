Enzyme does not officially support React 17 yet, but there is a community-supported adapter that you can use. You can install it by running:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, in your `src/setupTests.js` file, you can import and use the adapter like this:

```
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

Keep in mind that since this adapter is not officially supported by Enzyme, there may be some limitations or issues that you encounter while using it.
