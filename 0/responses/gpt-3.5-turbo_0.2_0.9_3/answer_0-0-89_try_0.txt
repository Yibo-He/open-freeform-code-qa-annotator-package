Yes, that is correct. The basic type check in VueJS prop validation will allow `null` and `undefined` values to pass any type validation. However, if you specify a specific type or a list of types for a prop, passing a `null` or `undefined` value will result in a type check failure. In your example, the `value` prop is defined as a type of `[String, Number, Boolean]`, so passing a `null` value will result in a type check failure.
