It looks like you are using the correct class `truncate` in your code. However, the `truncate` class only works if the parent element has a fixed width. 

Try adding a width to the parent element like this:

```
<div className="ml-1 inline-block w-64">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

In this example, I added the `w-64` class to the parent element to give it a fixed width of 64 pixels. You can adjust the width to fit your needs.
