It seems like you are missing the initialization code for the toast. You need to add the following code to your JavaScript file to initialize the toast:

```
$('.toast').toast();
```

This code initializes all the toasts on the page. You can also add options to the toast initialization like this:

```
$('.toast').toast({
  delay: 2000 // This will set the delay for the toast to 2 seconds
});
```

Make sure that you have added the jQuery library before the bootstrap JavaScript files. Also, make sure that you have added the correct classes to your toast div.

If you still face any issues, please let me know.
