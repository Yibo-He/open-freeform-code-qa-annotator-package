You can use the `querySelectorAll()` method to select the direct children of the `div` with class "section" using the `>` selector. Here's an example:

```javascript
const sectionDiv = document.querySelector('.section');
const directChildren = sectionDiv.querySelectorAll('> div');
```

This will return a NodeList containing the direct children of the `div` with class "section". You can then loop through this NodeList to access each child element:

```javascript
directChildren.forEach(child => {
  // do something with each child element
});
```
