It seems like you are trying to reload the current route in Angular. The code you provided looks correct, but there are a few things you can try to make it work.

First, make sure that you have imported the `Router` and `ActivatedRoute` from `@angular/router` in your component.

Second, try using `this.router.navigateByUrl('/', {skipLocationChange: true}).then(() => this.router.navigate([route]));` instead of `this.router.navigate([self]);`. This will navigate to the root URL and then navigate to the current route, effectively reloading it.

Finally, if none of the above works, try using a different approach. Instead of reloading the current route, you can navigate to a dummy route and then navigate back to the current route. For example:

```
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  this.router.navigate(['/dummy']).then(() => {
    this.router.navigate([route.routeConfig.path]);
  });
}
```

This will navigate to the `/dummy` route and then navigate back to the current route, effectively reloading it.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
