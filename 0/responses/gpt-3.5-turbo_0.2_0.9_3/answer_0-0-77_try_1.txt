To make Axios send cookies in requests automatically, you need to set the `withCredentials` option to `true` in your Axios request configuration. This will ensure that cookies are sent along with the request.

Here's an example:

```
axios.get(`some api url`, { withCredentials: true }).then(response => ...
```

Also, make sure that your server is configured to allow credentials by setting the `credentials` option to `true` in your CORS configuration. This will allow the server to receive cookies from the client.

Here's an example:

```
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://example.com',
  credentials: true
}));
```
