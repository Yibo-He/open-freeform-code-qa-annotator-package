Based on the error message, it seems that `npm` is unable to find the package `aws-sdk-js` in the registry. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The package has been removed from the registry.
2. There is an issue with the registry itself.
3. There is a problem with your internet connection.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package exists in the registry by visiting the following URL: https://registry.npmjs.org/aws-sdk-js. If the package is not found, it may have been removed.
2. Try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.
3. Check your internet connection to make sure it is working properly.
4. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then running `npm install` again.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to reach out to the package maintainer or the npm support team for further assistance.
