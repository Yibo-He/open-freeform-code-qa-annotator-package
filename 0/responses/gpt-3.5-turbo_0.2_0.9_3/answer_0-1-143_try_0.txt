To reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton, you can modify the browser's userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open Firefox and type "about:config" in the address bar.
2. Search for "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" and set it to "true".
3. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find the location of your profile folder by typing "about:support" in the address bar and looking for "Profile Folder" under "Application Basics".
4. In your profile folder, create a new folder called "chrome" (if it doesn't already exist).
5. Inside the "chrome" folder, create a new file called "userChrome.css".
6. Open the "userChrome.css" file in a text editor and add the following code:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .subviewbutton {
  padding-top: 4px !important;
  padding-bottom: 4px !important;
}
```

7. Save the "userChrome.css" file and restart Firefox.

This code will reduce the padding (i.e. spacing) between menu items in Firefox Proton's menu. You can adjust the values of "padding-top" and "padding-bottom" to your liking.
