To configure axios to trust the SSL certificate and correctly verify it, you can provide the root certificate of the server's SSL certificate to the https agent. Here's an example:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');
const axios = require('axios');

const cert = fs.readFileSync('/path/to/server/cert.pem');

const agent = new https.Agent({
  ca: cert
});

const result = await axios.post(
  `https://${url}/login`,
  body,
  {
    httpsAgent: agent
  }
);
```

In this example, we're reading the server's SSL certificate from a file and passing it to the `https.Agent` constructor as the `ca` option. This tells the agent to trust the certificate signed by this root certificate.

Make sure to replace `/path/to/server/cert.pem` with the actual path to the server's SSL certificate file.
