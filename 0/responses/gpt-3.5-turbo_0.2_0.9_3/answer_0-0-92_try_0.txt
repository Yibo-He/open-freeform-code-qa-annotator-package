It looks like the issue is with the `node` configuration in your webpack configuration file. The error message indicates that the `node` configuration object has unknown properties such as `module`, `net`, and `fs`. 

In Webpack 5, the `node` configuration object has been updated to be more restrictive. It now only allows the properties `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `global`. 

To fix this issue, you can update your `node` configuration to only include these properties. Here's an updated version of your webpack configuration file with the `node` configuration updated:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  mode: 'development',
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
  node: {
    __dirname: false,
    __filename: false,
    global: true,
  },
};
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing and allow you to use the `antlr4` library with Webpack 5.
