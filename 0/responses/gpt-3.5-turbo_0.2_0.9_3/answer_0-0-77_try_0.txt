To automatically send cookies in all Axios requests, you can use Axios interceptors. 

Here's an example:

```
import axios from 'axios';

axios.interceptors.request.use(
  config => {
    const cookie = document.cookie;
    if (cookie) {
      config.headers.Cookie = cookie;
    }
    return config;
  },
  error => Promise.reject(error)
);
```

This code intercepts all Axios requests and adds the `Cookie` header to the request if there is a cookie set in the browser. 

Note that this code assumes that the cookie is set on the domain where the Axios requests are being made. If the cookie is set on a different domain, you may need to configure CORS on your server to allow the cookie to be sent with the request.
