The error message indicates that the module `jmespath` is missing. This module is required by your Lambda function and needs to be installed in your project's `node_modules` directory.

To fix this issue, you can run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install jmespath
```

This will install the `jmespath` module and its dependencies in your project's `node_modules` directory. Once the installation is complete, you can redeploy your Lambda function and it should work as expected.
