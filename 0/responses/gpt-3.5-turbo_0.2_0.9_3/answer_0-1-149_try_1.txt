To achieve the animation effect shown in the video, you can use the `transform` property in CSS. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired effect:

1. Add the following CSS to your `.link` class:

```
.link {
  position: relative;
  display: inline-block;
  color: #000;
  text-decoration: none;
  font-weight: 600;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.link:hover {
  color: #fff;
}

.link::before {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -2px;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background-color: #000;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-in-out;
}

.link:hover::before {
  transform: scaleX(1);
}
```

2. Remove the `:after` pseudo-element from your `.link` class.

This code will create a horizontal line that will appear below the link when you hover over it. The `transform` property is used to animate the line from left to right. The `transform-origin` property is used to set the origin of the transformation to the left side of the line. The `transition` property is used to animate the transformation over a period of 0.3 seconds.

I hope this helps you achieve the desired effect!
