You can change the height of the `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by adding custom CSS to your component. Here's an example:

```css
.mat-form-field-outline {
  height: 32px; /* change this value to adjust the height */
}

.mat-form-field-outline .mat-form-field-outline-start,
.mat-form-field-outline .mat-form-field-outline-end {
  height: 100%;
}
```

You can add this CSS to your component's CSS file or to your global styles file. This will reduce the height of the `mat-form-field` while maintaining the outline appearance.
