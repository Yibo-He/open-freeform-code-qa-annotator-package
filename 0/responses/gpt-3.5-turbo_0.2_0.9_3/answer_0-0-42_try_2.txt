The error message is indicating that the `MongoStore` constructor function is being called without the `new` keyword. This means that the `MongoStore` function is being invoked as a regular function instead of as a constructor.

To fix this error, you need to make sure that you are calling the `MongoStore` constructor function with the `new` keyword. In your code, you are already doing this correctly when you pass `mongoose.connection` as an argument to the `MongoStore` constructor:

```
store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection })
```

However, it's possible that the error is being caused by another part of your code that is calling the `MongoStore` function without the `new` keyword. Make sure that you are not accidentally calling the `MongoStore` function as a regular function anywhere else in your code.

If you are still having trouble, try checking the version of the `connect-mongo` package you are using. It's possible that there is a compatibility issue with the version you are using and the version of Node.js you are running.
