The error message you received indicates that `process` is not defined. This is likely because `process` is a global object in Node.js, but it is not available in the browser environment where your Vue application is running.

To use environment variables in a Vue application, you can use the `dotenv` package to load environment variables from a `.env` file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `dotenv` package:

```
npm install dotenv --save-dev
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define your environment variables:

```
APP_ENV=prod
```

3. In your Vue application, import `dotenv` and call `config()` to load the environment variables:

```
import dotenv from 'dotenv';
dotenv.config();

const isProduct = process.env.APP_ENV === "prod";
```

Now you should be able to use `process.env` to access your environment variables. Note that you should never commit your `.env` file to source control, as it may contain sensitive information.
