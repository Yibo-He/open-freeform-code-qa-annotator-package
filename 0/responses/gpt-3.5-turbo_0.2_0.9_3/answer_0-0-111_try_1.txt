It seems like there are conflicting dependencies in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache.
3. Update your `npm` version by running `npm install -g npm`.
4. Install the latest version of `@angular/cli` globally by running `npm install -g @angular/cli`.
5. Install the dependencies in the correct order:

```
npm install @angular/compiler-cli@11.0.0
npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
npm install @angular/cdk@11.0.0
npm install @angular/core@11.0.0
npm install @angular/material@11.0.0
npm install
```

6. If the issue persists, try running `npm audit fix --force` to force the installation of the latest compatible versions of the dependencies.

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
