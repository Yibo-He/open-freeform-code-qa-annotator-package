This error message is related to the postcss-scss package. It seems like the package is not installed or not properly installed. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm install` to reinstall all the packages.
3. If the issue persists, try updating the `postcss-scss` package to the latest version by running `npm install postcss-scss@latest`.
4. If the issue still persists, try downgrading the `postcss-scss` package to the previous version by running `npm install postcss-scss@0.36.2`.

If none of the above steps work, you can try checking if there are any conflicts between the packages installed in your project. You can use the `npm ls` command to check for any dependency conflicts.
