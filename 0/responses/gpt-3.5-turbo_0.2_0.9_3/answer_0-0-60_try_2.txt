The error message would be helpful to diagnose the issue. However, based on the code snippet provided, it seems that you are trying to import jQuery as a global variable, which is not recommended. Instead, you can import it as a module and use it in your code like this:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import './index.css';
import $ from 'jquery';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

Make sure that you have installed both jQuery and Bootstrap using npm or yarn before importing them in your code.
