Unfortunately, passing parameters from a parent navigator to a child navigator is not possible yet in React Navigation. The issue you found on GitHub is still open and unresolved. 

However, there are some workarounds you can try. One option is to use a state management library like Redux or Context API to pass the parameters between screens. Another option is to use a global variable to store the parameters and access them in the child screens. 

Here's an example of using a global variable:

```
// In the parent screen
const onPressHandler = () => {
  global.followingParams = { isPublicProfile, firstName };
  navigation.navigate('following');
};

// In the child screen
const PageScreen = () => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = global.followingParams;
  // Use the parameters here
  ...
};
```

Note that using a global variable is not recommended for larger applications as it can lead to maintenance issues and bugs. It's better to use a state management library or wait for the React Navigation team to implement a solution for passing parameters between navigators.
