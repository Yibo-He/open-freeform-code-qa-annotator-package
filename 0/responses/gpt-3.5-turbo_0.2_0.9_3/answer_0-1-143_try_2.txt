To reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton, you can modify the browser's userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Firefox and type "about:config" in the address bar.
2. Search for "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" and set it to "true".
3. Open your Firefox profile folder by typing "about:support" in the address bar and clicking on the "Open Folder" button next to "Profile Folder".
4. In the profile folder, create a new folder called "chrome" (if it doesn't already exist).
5. Inside the "chrome" folder, create a new file called "userChrome.css".
6. Open the "userChrome.css" file with a text editor.
7. Add the following code to the file:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu .subviewheader {
  padding-block: 0.25em !important;
}
#PanelUI-menu .subviewbody > menuitem {
  padding-block: 0.25em 0.5em !important;
}
```

8. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This should reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton. If you want to adjust the spacing further, you can modify the values in the CSS code (e.g. change "0.25em" to "0.1em" for tighter spacing).
