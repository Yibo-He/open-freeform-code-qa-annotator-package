To remove a package installed using `ng add`, you can follow these steps:

1. Remove the package using your package manager (npm or yarn). For example, to remove the `@angular/material` package, you can run:

   ```
   npm uninstall @angular/material
   ```

2. Remove any configuration changes made by the package. For example, if you installed `@angular/material`, you may have added some styles to your `styles.scss` file. Remove those styles.

3. Remove any code generated by the package. For example, if you installed `@angular/material`, you may have some components or modules that were generated by the package. Remove those files.

4. If the package added any dependencies to your `package.json` file, remove them manually.

Note that `ng rm` is not a valid command in Angular CLI yet. It may be added in a future version.
