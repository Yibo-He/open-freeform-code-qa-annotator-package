Based on the information you provided, it seems like the issue might be related to the dynamic route. Here are some things you can try:

1. Check if the dynamic route is correctly defined in your `pages` folder. Make sure that the file name matches the route name and that it has the correct file extension (`.tsx` in your case).

2. Check if the dynamic route is correctly linked in your code. Make sure that you are using the correct link path and that you are passing the correct parameters.

3. Check if the dynamic route is correctly deployed on Vercel. Make sure that the route is included in the list of routes that Vercel is serving.

4. Check if there are any errors in your Vercel logs. The logs might provide more information about the cause of the 404 error.

5. Check if there are any issues with your Vercel deployment settings. Make sure that you have configured Vercel to build and deploy your app correctly.

If none of these steps help, you might want to consider sharing your code or logs so that we can take a closer look.
