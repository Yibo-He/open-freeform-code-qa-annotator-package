It seems that you have set the `scroll-snap-type` property twice in your CSS, which is causing the vertical snap scrolling to not work. You should remove the second `scroll-snap-type` property and keep only the first one. Here's the corrected CSS code:

```
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

This should fix the issue and enable vertical snap scrolling on your page.
