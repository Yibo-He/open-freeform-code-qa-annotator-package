It seems like there are conflicting dependencies between the packages you are trying to update. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.
2. Run `npm cache clean --force` to clear the npm cache.
3. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies again.
4. Try updating the packages one by one in a specific order:

   a. `@angular/cli`
   
   b. `@angular/core`
   
   c. `@angular-devkit/build-angular`
   
   d. `@angular/cdk`
   
   e. `@angular/material`

   You can use the following commands to update each package:
   
   ```
   ng update @angular/cli@11.0.1
   ng update @angular/core@11.0.0
   ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
   ng update @angular/cdk@11.0.0
   ng update @angular/material@11.0.0
   ```
   
5. If you still encounter errors, try running `npm audit fix --force` to force npm to install the latest compatible versions of the packages.

If none of these steps work, you may need to manually update the conflicting dependencies in your `package.json` file to resolve the issue.
