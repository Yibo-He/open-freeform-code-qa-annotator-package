There is no built-in method or function in React that resets the state back to its initial values. However, you can create a separate object that holds the initial state values and use it to reset the state.

Here's an example:

```
const Signup = () => {
    const initialState = {
        username: '',
        email: '',
        password: '',
        passwordConfirmation: ''
    }

    const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            setState(initialState) // <-----------
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```

In this example, we create an `initialState` object that holds the initial values for each piece of state. Then, in the `handleSubmit` function, we use `setState` to set the state back to the `initialState` object. This way, we don't have to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings in `clearState`.
