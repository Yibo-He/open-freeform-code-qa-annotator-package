The error message indicates that some of the dependencies have incompatible versions. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Update the `rxjs` package to version 6.2.0 by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install rxjs@6.2.0
   ```

2. Update the `typescript` package to version 2.7.2 or higher by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install typescript@">=2.7.2 <2.8"
   ```

3. After updating the dependencies, run the `ng update @angular/core` command again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try removing the `@angular/flex-layout` package temporarily and then running the update command. Once the update is complete, you can reinstall the `@angular/flex-layout` package with the updated dependencies.

```
npm uninstall @angular/flex-layout
ng update @angular/core
npm install @angular/flex-layout
```

Make sure to test your app thoroughly after the update to ensure that everything is working as expected.
