You can use the Intersection Observer API to detect when an element is visible on the viewport. Here's an example code snippet that should work for your use case:

```
const parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
const divs = parent.querySelectorAll('div');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      console.log(entry.target.id + ' is visible on viewport');
    }
  });
});

divs.forEach(div => {
  observer.observe(div);
});
```

In this code, we first select the `#parent` element and all its child `div` elements. Then, we create a new `IntersectionObserver` instance and pass a callback function that will be called whenever an observed element intersects with the viewport. Inside the callback, we check if the `isIntersecting` property of the `entry` object is true, which means the element is currently visible on the viewport. Finally, we loop through all the `div` elements and call the `observe` method of the observer instance to start observing each element.
