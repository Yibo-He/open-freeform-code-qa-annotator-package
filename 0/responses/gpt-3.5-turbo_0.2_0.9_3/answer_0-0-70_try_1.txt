The warning message is indicating that the `updatedcount` event listener is not being properly inherited by the parent component. This is because the child component is rendering a fragment or text root node, which prevents the event listener from being automatically inherited.

To fix this, you can declare the `updatedcount` event in the child component's `emits` option. This tells Vue that the event is intended to be a custom event listener and should be properly inherited by the parent component.

Here's how you can update the child component:

```
<template>
  <h1>{{ store.count }}</h1>
  <button @click="fired">click me</button>
</template>

<script>
import { defineEmits } from 'vue';
import useStore from "../store/store.js";

export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  emits: ['updatedcount'], // declare the custom event here
  setup(_,{ emit }) {
    const store = useStore();

    const fired = () => {
      store.count++;
      emit("updatedcount", store.count);
    };

    return {
      store,
      fired
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

By declaring the `updatedcount` event in the child component's `emits` option, the parent component will be able to properly inherit the event listener.
