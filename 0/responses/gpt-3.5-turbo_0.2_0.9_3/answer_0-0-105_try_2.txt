It is not common to use both Cypress and Jest together in the same project, as they serve different purposes and can lead to unnecessary duplication of effort. 

Cypress is primarily used for end-to-end testing, while Jest is used for unit testing. If you are testing the same functionality in both libraries, it may be worth reconsidering which library is best suited for the task at hand. 

That being said, there may be cases where using both libraries makes sense. For example, if you have a complex application with many different types of tests, you may find that Cypress is better suited for some tests while Jest is better suited for others. 

Ultimately, the decision to use one or both libraries will depend on the specific needs of your project and the preferences of your team. It is important to weigh the benefits and drawbacks of each approach and choose the one that works best for your situation.
