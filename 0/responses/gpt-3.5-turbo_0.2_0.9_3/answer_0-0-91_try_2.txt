It seems like the `react-native-template-typescript` package is not available in the registry. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and make sure you have a stable connection.
2. Clear the cache of your package manager. If you are using `npm`, run `npm cache clean --force`. If you are using `yarn`, run `yarn cache clean`.
3. Try running the command again after clearing the cache.

If the issue persists, you can try using a different template or creating a new project without a template and adding typescript manually.
