To make Axios send cookies automatically with each request, you need to set the `withCredentials` option to `true` when making the request. This will ensure that the cookies are sent along with the request.

Here's an example:

```
axios.get(`some api url`, { withCredentials: true }).then(response => ...
```

You can also set this option globally for all Axios requests by using the `axios.defaults.withCredentials` property:

```
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

Make sure that your server is also configured to allow credentials by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`. Here's an example:

```
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "http://localhost:3000");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");
  res.header("Access-Control-Allow-Credentials", true);
  next();
});
```

With these changes, your Axios requests should automatically include the cookies set on the client side.
