Unfortunately, it is not possible to parse `undefined` values in JSON. According to the JSON specification, `undefined` is not a valid value and should not be used. 

If you have control over the API that is generating the JSON, you should modify it to use a valid value instead of `undefined`. 

If you do not have control over the API, you can try to modify the JSON string before parsing it. One approach is to use a regular expression to replace all occurrences of `"undefined"` with `null`, which is a valid JSON value. Here's an example:

```
const jsonString = '{ "name": undefined }';
const fixedJsonString = jsonString.replace(/"undefined"/g, 'null');
const parsedJson = JSON.parse(fixedJsonString);
```

However, this approach may not work in all cases, especially if the `undefined` value is nested within a more complex JSON structure. In that case, you may need to write a custom parser that can handle the `undefined` value.
