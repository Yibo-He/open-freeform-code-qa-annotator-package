Yes, there is a better way to type `previousPieceSelected` in the initial state return. You can use a union type to allow it to be either `Piece` or `undefined`. Here's how you can update your code:

```
export const useStore = defineStore("game", {
  state: () => {
    return {
      moves: [],
      gameBoard:  getInitialBoard(),
      playerTurn: PieceColor.White,
      previousPieceSelected: undefined as Piece | undefined
    }
  },
  actions: {
    changePlayer() {
      this.playerTurn =
          this.playerTurn === PieceColor.White
            ? PieceColor.Black
            : PieceColor.White;
    },
    updatePreviousPieceSelected(piece: Piece | undefined ) {
      this.previousPieceSelected = piece
    }
  }
})
```

By using `undefined as Piece | undefined`, you are telling TypeScript that `previousPieceSelected` can be either `Piece` or `undefined`. This way, you can avoid the hack you were using earlier.
