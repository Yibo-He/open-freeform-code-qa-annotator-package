The warning message is indicating that the `updatedcount` event listener is not being properly inherited by the parent component. This is likely because the parent component is rendering a fragment or text node instead of a single root element.

To fix this, you can declare the `emits` option in the child component to explicitly specify which events it emits. In your case, you can add `emits: ['updatedcount']` to the child component's options:

```
<script>
import useStore from "../store/store.js";
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  emits: ['updatedcount'], // add this line
  setup(_,{ emit }) {
    const store = useStore();

    const fired = () => {
      store.count++;
      emit("updatedcount", store.count);
    };

    return {
      store,
      fired
    };
  },
};
</script>
```

This tells Vue that the `HelloWorld` component emits the `updatedcount` event, and allows the parent component to properly inherit the event listener.

With this change, the warning message should disappear and the `mydata` function in the parent component should be called with the emitted data from the child component.
