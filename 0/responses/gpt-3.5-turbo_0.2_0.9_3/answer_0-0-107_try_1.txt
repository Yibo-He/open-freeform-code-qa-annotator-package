This error message indicates that the PowerShell script execution policy on your Windows 10 machine is preventing the execution of the expo command. 

To resolve this issue, you can change the PowerShell execution policy to allow script execution. 

Here are the steps to change the PowerShell execution policy:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.

2. Run the following command to check the current execution policy:

   ```
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```

3. If the output is `Restricted`, then the execution policy is preventing script execution. 

4. To change the execution policy to allow script execution, run the following command:

   ```
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
   ```

   This command sets the execution policy to allow local scripts to run, but requires remote scripts to be signed by a trusted publisher.

5. When prompted, confirm the change by typing `Y` and pressing Enter.

6. Now, try running the `expo --version` command again. It should work without any errors.

Note: Changing the PowerShell execution policy can have security implications. Make sure you understand the risks before making any changes.
