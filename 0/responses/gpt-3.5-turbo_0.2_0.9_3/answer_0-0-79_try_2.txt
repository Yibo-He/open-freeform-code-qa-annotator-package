It looks like the error is caused by the fact that you are trying to import a local file using a relative path, but the path is incorrect. 

Make sure that the path to the `api.js` file is correct and that it is relative to the `server.js` file. 

For example, if the `api.js` file is located in the same directory as the `server.js` file, you can try changing the import statement to:

```
import apis from './api'
```

If the `api.js` file is located in a different directory, you will need to adjust the path accordingly.
