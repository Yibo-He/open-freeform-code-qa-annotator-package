This is a known issue in Safari where the `height: auto` property does not work as expected on flexbox items. One workaround is to set the `align-items` property of the flex container to `flex-start`. Here's the updated CSS:

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: flex-start; /* workaround for Safari */
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
}
```

This should fix the issue in Safari and maintain the aspect ratio of the images.
