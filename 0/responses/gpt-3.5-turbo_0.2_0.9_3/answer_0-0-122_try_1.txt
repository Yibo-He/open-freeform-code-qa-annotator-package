To install an older version of `npm`, you can use the following command:

```
npm install -g npm@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the specific version number you want to install. For example, if you want to install version 6.14.4, you would run:

```
npm install -g npm@6.14.4
```

This will install the specified version of `npm` globally on your system. You can then verify the version by running:

```
npm -v
```

This will display the version number of `npm` currently installed on your system.
