There could be several reasons why you are unable to run Flipper on your macOS Catalina 10.15.3. Here are some troubleshooting steps you can try:

1. Check if your macOS version is compatible with Flipper. According to the Flipper documentation, macOS 10.13 or later is required to run Flipper. Since you are using macOS Catalina 10.15.3, this should not be an issue.

2. Check if you have installed the correct version of Flipper. Make sure you have downloaded the macOS version of Flipper from the official website.

3. Check if you have the necessary permissions to run Flipper. Right-click on the Flipper app icon and select "Open". If you see a warning message, click on "Open" again to confirm that you want to run the app.

4. Check if there are any conflicting applications or processes running on your system that may be preventing Flipper from running. Try closing all other applications and restarting your computer before running Flipper again.

5. If none of the above steps work, try reinstalling Flipper. Delete the existing Flipper app from your system and download and install the latest version from the official website.

If you are still unable to run Flipper after trying these troubleshooting steps, you may want to contact Flipper support for further assistance.
