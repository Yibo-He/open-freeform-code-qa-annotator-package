The error message you are seeing is indicating that `process` is not defined. This error can occur when you are trying to use `process` in a client-side context, such as in a browser environment, where `process` is not available.

To use `process.env` in a Vue + TypeScript project, you need to make sure that you are using a build tool that supports environment variables, such as webpack or rollup. You also need to make sure that you have defined the environment variables that you want to use.

Here are the steps you can follow to define and use environment variables in a Vue + TypeScript project:

1. Install the `dotenv` package as a development dependency:

```
npm install --save-dev dotenv
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and define your environment variables:

```
APP_ENV=prod
```

3. In your `vue.config.js` file, add the following code to load the environment variables:

```
const dotenv = require('dotenv');
dotenv.config();
```

4. In your TypeScript code, you can now use `process.env` to access the environment variables:

```
const isProduct = process.env.APP_ENV === "prod";
```

Note that you need to restart your development server after making changes to the `.env` file.
