When you set `"sourceMap": false` in your `tsconfig.json` file, the TypeScript compiler will not generate source map files for your TypeScript code. Source maps are files that map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, making it easier to debug your code in the browser's developer tools.

If you set `"sourceMap": false`, the browser's developer tools will not be able to map the compiled JavaScript code back to the original TypeScript code, making it harder to debug your code. However, this will not affect the functionality of your Angular app.

So, if you set `"sourceMap": false`, you will not see any visible change in your app, but it may make it harder to debug your code in the browser's developer tools.
