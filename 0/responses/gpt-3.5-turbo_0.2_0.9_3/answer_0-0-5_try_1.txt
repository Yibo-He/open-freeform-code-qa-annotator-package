It seems like the issue is with the node-sass package which requires node-gyp and Python to be installed. You can try installing a version of node-sass that does not require node-gyp and Python by running the following command:

```
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

This version of node-sass does not require node-gyp and Python to be installed.

Alternatively, you can install Python and add it to your system's PATH environment variable. You can download Python from the official website and follow the installation instructions.

Once Python is installed, you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. You can do this by running the following command:

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

Replace `C:\Python27\python.exe` with the path to your Python executable.

After setting the PYTHON environment variable, try running the build again. It should work now.

If you are still facing issues, you can try upgrading node-gyp to the latest version by running the following command:

```
npm install -g node-gyp
```

This should update node-gyp to the latest version and fix any issues related to it.
