The issue with your code is that the `else` block is not being executed because the `getCurrentPosition` method is an asynchronous function and the `if` block is being executed before the user has a chance to respond to the location permission prompt.

To fix this issue, you can pass a second function as a parameter to the `getCurrentPosition` method. This function will be executed if the user denies the location permission. Here's an updated code snippet:

```
ngOnInit() {
   this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
   if (navigator.geolocation) {
      navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
         position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
         },
         error => {
            console.log("User denied location permission");
         }
      );
   } else {
      console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
   }
}
```

With this code, if the user denies the location permission, the `error` function will be executed and the message "User denied location permission" will be logged to the console.
