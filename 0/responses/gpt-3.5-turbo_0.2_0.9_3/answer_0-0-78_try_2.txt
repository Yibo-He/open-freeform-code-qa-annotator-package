One solution to this problem is to use the `replace` method instead of `push` when navigating from the loading screen to the results screen. The `replace` method replaces the current route in the history with the new one, instead of adding it to the history. This way, when the user clicks the back button from the results screen, they will be taken directly to the main screen, instead of going back to the loading screen.

Here's an example of how you can use the `replace` method:

```
// Navigate from loading screen to results screen
this.$router.replace({ path: "/results/xxxx" });
```

Alternatively, you can use the `go` method to navigate back to the main screen from the results screen, without going through the loading screen:

```
// Navigate back to main screen
this.$router.go(-2);
```

The `go` method takes a parameter that specifies how many steps to go back in the history. In this case, we want to go back two steps, which will take us directly to the main screen.
