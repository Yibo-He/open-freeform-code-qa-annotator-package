This is a known issue in Safari where it doesn't properly calculate the height of images with `height: auto` inside nested flexbox containers. One workaround is to set a fixed height on the parent container of the image. 

In your case, you can add a fixed height to the `section` element that contains the image, like this:

```
.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
  height: 125px; /* add a fixed height */
}
```

This will ensure that the image maintains its aspect ratio and doesn't get stretched in Safari.
