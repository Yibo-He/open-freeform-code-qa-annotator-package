It looks like you have tried a few different solutions to get absolute imports working, but none of them have worked so far. Here are a few more things you can try:

1. Update your `tsconfig.json` file to include the `paths` property:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "client",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"],
      "@hooks/*": ["hooks/*"],
      "@assets/*": ["assets/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["./**/*.ts", "./**/*.tsx", "client"]
}
```

This will allow you to use import statements like `import { MyComponent } from '@components/MyComponent'`.

2. Update your `webpack.config.js` file to include the `resolve.alias` property:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@components': path.resolve(__dirname, 'client/components'),
      '@hooks': path.resolve(__dirname, 'client/hooks'),
      '@assets': path.resolve(__dirname, 'client/assets')
    }
  }
};
```

This will allow you to use import statements like `import { MyComponent } from '@components/MyComponent'`.

3. Make sure that your import statements are using the correct paths. For example, if you have a component located at `client/components/MyComponent.tsx`, you should import it like this:

```
import { MyComponent } from 'components/MyComponent';
```

Note that you don't need to include the `client` directory in the import statement, since you have set the `baseUrl` to `client` in your `tsconfig.json` file.

Hopefully one of these solutions will work for you! Let me know if you have any questions.
