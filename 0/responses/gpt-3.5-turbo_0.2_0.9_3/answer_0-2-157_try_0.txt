The warning message is suggesting to use `::v-deep(<inner-selector>)` instead of `::v-deep` as a combinator. 

In your case, you can update the CSS selector as follows:

```
.parent ::v-deep(.child) {
   ...
}
```

This will apply the styles to the `.child` element inside the `.parent` component.

Note that `::v-deep` is used to apply styles to child components from a parent component. However, it is recommended to use scoped CSS or CSS modules instead of `::v-deep` whenever possible to avoid potential conflicts with other components.
