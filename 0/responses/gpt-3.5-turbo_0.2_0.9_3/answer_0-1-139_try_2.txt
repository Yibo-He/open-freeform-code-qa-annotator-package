You can extract the breakpoints from the Tailwind config file by accessing the `theme` object and looking for the `screens` property. This property contains an object with the breakpoint names as keys and the corresponding screen sizes as values.

Here's an example of how you can extract the breakpoints as mixins in SCSS:

```
@each $breakpoint, $size in theme('screens') {
  @mixin #{$breakpoint} {
    @media (min-width: #{$size}) {
      @content;
    }
  }
}
```

This will create mixins for each breakpoint defined in the Tailwind config file, which you can then use in your styles like this:

```
@include md {
  // styles for medium screens and above
}
``` 

Hope this helps!
