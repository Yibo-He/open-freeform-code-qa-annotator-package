With Font Awesome 5, you need to use a different font family name. Try using the following code instead:

```
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "Font Awesome 5 Free";
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

Note that I added `font-weight: 900` to ensure that the icon is displayed correctly. Also, make sure that you have included the Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
