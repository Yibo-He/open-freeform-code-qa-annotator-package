Yes, there is a better solution in JavaScript to check if a value is not null and not an empty string. You can use the following code:

```
var data; //get its value from db 
if(data && data.trim()) {
   // do something
}
```

Here, the `trim()` method removes any whitespace from the beginning and end of the string. If the resulting string is not empty, the condition is true. This approach is more concise and easier to read.
