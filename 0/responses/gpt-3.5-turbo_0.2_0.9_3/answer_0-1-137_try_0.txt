The error message suggests that the `$theme-colors` variable is not in a valid CSS format. Bootstrap's `variables.scss` file expects the `$theme-colors` variable to be in a specific format, which is an associative array of color names and their values in hexadecimal format.

To fix the error, you need to make sure that your `$theme-colors` variable is in the correct format. Here's an example of how you can define the `$theme-colors` variable:

```
$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #0d6efd,
  "secondary": #6c757d,
  "success": #198754,
  "info": #0dcaf0,
  "warning": #ffc107,
  "danger": #dc3545,
  "light": #f8f9fa,
  "dark": #212529
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure that you define the colors in hexadecimal format and that you separate the color names and values with a colon. Once you've defined the `$theme-colors` variable correctly, you should be able to compile your SCSS file without any errors.
