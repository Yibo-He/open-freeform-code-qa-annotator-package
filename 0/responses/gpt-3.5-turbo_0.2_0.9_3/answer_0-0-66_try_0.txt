Yes, you can use the `.only` method in Cypress to run only a specific test. 

To do this, simply add `.only` after the `it` or `describe` block that you want to run exclusively. 

For example:

```
describe.only('My exclusive test', () => {
  it('should do something', () => {
    // test code here
  });
});
```

This will run only the test block with the `describe.only` method and skip all other tests. 

Just remember to remove the `.only` method once you're done testing that specific block, so that all tests can run again.
