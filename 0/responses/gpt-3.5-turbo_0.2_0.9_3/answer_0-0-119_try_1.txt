The issue might be with the way you are importing `AuthContext` in `RegisterRoutes` component. Instead of importing it as a default export, you should import it as a named export.

Try changing this line:

```
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
```

to:

```
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

This should fix the issue.
