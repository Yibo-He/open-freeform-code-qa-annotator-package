The issue is that the import paths you are using are outdated. The latest version of `react-icons` no longer uses the `lib` folder in the import path. Instead, you should import the icons directly from the package like this:

```
import { MdTerrain } from 'react-icons/md';
import { TiWeatherSnow } from 'react-icons/ti';
import { FaCalendar } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

Make sure to update your import statements accordingly and it should work.
