The error message is telling you that you should use a string or a number as the value for the `:key` attribute in your `v-for` loop, instead of using the entire `comment` object. 

To fix this, you can use the `comment.id` property (assuming that each comment has a unique `id` value) as the key:

```
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

This should resolve the warning message.
