It looks like you are running into a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One solution is to install `eslint-config-react-app` which is specifically designed to work with `create-react-app` and includes all the necessary dependencies.

Here are the steps to install `eslint-config-react-app`:

1. Remove `eslint` and `babel-eslint` from your project by running the following command:

   ```
   npm uninstall eslint babel-eslint
   ```

2. Install `eslint-config-react-app` by running the following command:

   ```
   npm install eslint-config-react-app --save-dev
   ```

3. Update your `.eslintrc` file to extend `eslint-config-react-app`:

   ```
   {
     "extends": "react-app"
   }
   ```

4. Run your linter again and it should work without any conflicts.
