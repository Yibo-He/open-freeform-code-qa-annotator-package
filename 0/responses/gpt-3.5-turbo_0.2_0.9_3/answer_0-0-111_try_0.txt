It seems like you are facing dependency conflicts while updating your Angular project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running the following command:
```
npm cache clean --force
```

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

3. Install the latest version of `@angular/cli` globally by running the following command:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli@latest
```

4. Install the packages in the following order:
```
npm install @angular/compiler-cli@11.0.0
npm install @angular-devkit/build-angular@0.1100.1
npm install @angular/core@11.0.0
npm install @angular/cdk@11.0.0
npm install @angular/material@11.0.0
```

5. If you still face dependency conflicts, try updating the conflicting packages individually by running the following commands:
```
ng update @angular/cli @angular/core
ng update @angular-devkit/build-angular
ng update @angular/cdk
ng update @angular/material
```

6. If the issue persists, try updating to a lower version of Angular and then updating to the desired version.

7. If none of the above steps work, you can try creating a new Angular project with the desired version and copying over your code and dependencies.

I hope these steps help you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions.
