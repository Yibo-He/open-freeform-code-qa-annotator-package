The error message is indicating that the `MongoStore` class constructor is being called without the `new` keyword. This means that the `MongoStore` object is not being properly instantiated.

To fix this error, make sure that you are using the `new` keyword when creating a new instance of the `MongoStore` class. In your `app.js` file, update the `store` property of the `session` configuration to use the `new` keyword like this:

```
app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection })
}))
```

This should properly instantiate the `MongoStore` object and resolve the error.
