This error message indicates that there is a problem with the `postcss-scss` package. It seems like the package is not being loaded correctly or there is an issue with the package itself.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the cache and reinstall the dependencies by running the following commands:
```
npm cache clean --force
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

2. Check if there are any updates available for the `postcss-scss` package by running the following command:
```
npm outdated postcss-scss
```

If there is an update available, try updating the package by running:
```
npm update postcss-scss
```

3. If the above steps do not work, try removing the `postcss-scss` package and reinstalling it by running the following commands:
```
npm uninstall postcss-scss
npm install postcss-scss
```

4. If none of the above steps work, try downgrading the `postcss-scss` package to a previous version that was working by running the following command:
```
npm install postcss-scss@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the version number that was working previously.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue.
