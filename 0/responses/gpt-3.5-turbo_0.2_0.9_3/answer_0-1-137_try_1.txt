The error message suggests that the `map-loop` function is expecting a valid CSS value, but it's receiving a map instead. This could be because you're missing a semicolon after defining the `primary` color in your `$theme-colors` map.

Try updating your code to the following:

```
@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";

$theme-colors: (
  "primary": #your-color-here;
);

@import "../../node_modules/bootstrap/scss/bootstrap";
```

Make sure to replace `#your-color-here` with the actual color value you want to use.

Also, make sure that you have installed the latest version of Sass (currently 1.37.5) and that you're using the correct command to compile your SCSS file. The correct command should be:

```
sass style.scss custom.css
```

If you're still having issues, try removing the `!default` flag from the `$theme-colors-rgb` variable in the Bootstrap source code. This flag is used to set a default value if the variable is not already defined, but it can sometimes cause issues when overriding variables. To remove the flag, find the following line in `_variables.scss`:

```
$theme-colors-rgb: map-loop($theme-colors, to-rgb, "$value") !default;
```

And change it to:

```
$theme-colors-rgb: map-loop($theme-colors, to-rgb, "$value");
```

Save the file and try compiling your SCSS again.
