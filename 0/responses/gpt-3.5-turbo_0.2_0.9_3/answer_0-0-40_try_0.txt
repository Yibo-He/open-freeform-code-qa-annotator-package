Based on the information you provided, it seems like `npm` is not installed on your system. 

You can try installing `npm` using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing `npm` using `nvm` (Node Version Manager). Here are the steps to install `nvm` and then use it to install `npm`:

1. Install `nvm` using the following command:

```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.35.3/install.sh | bash
```

2. Close and reopen your terminal to start using `nvm`.

3. Install the latest version of Node.js using `nvm`:

```
nvm install node
```

4. Use the following command to install `npm`:

```
npm install -g npm
```

This should install `npm` on your system. You can check the version of `npm` using the `npm -v` command.
