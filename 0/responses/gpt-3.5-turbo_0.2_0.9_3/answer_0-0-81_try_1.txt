This error message indicates that the app is unable to load the JavaScript bundle file. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that you have generated a release build of the JavaScript bundle file. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

This command will generate a release build of the JavaScript bundle file and place it in the correct location in your Android project.

2. Check that the `index.android.bundle` file is included in your release build. You can do this by navigating to the `android/app/src/main/assets` directory in your Android project and verifying that the file is present.

3. Verify that the `proguard-rules.pro` file in your Android project includes the necessary rules for React Native. You can add the following lines to the file:

```
-keep class com.facebook.react.** { *; }
-dontwarn com.facebook.react.**
```

4. If you are using a custom `Application` class in your Android project, make sure that it is properly configured to initialize React Native. You can do this by adding the following lines to the `onCreate` method of your `Application` class:

```
SoLoader.init(this, false);
ReactNativeFlipper.initializeFlipper(this);
```

5. Finally, make sure that you are running the correct version of React Native in your Android project. You can check this by verifying the version number in your `package.json` file and comparing it to the version number in your Android project's `build.gradle` file. If they do not match, you may need to update your Android project to use the correct version of React Native.
