The issue with the current implementation is that the `styled.li` component is being created inside the functional component `Tab`. This means that every time `Tab` is rendered, a new `styled.li` component is created, which can lead to performance issues.

To refactor the code and use the required props to create a dynamic style, you can move the `styled.li` component outside of the `Tab` component and pass the required props as arguments to the styled component. Here's an example:

```
import React from 'react'
import styled from 'styled-components'

const TabWrapper = styled.li`
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  padding: 100px;
  margin: 1px;
  font-size: 3em;
  color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `white` : `black`)};
  background-color: ${props => (props.isSelected ? `black` : `#C4C4C4`)};
  cursor: ${props => (props.isSelected ? 'default' : `pointer`)};
`

const Tab = ({ onClick, isSelected, children }) => {
  return <TabWrapper onClick={onClick} isSelected={isSelected}>{children}</TabWrapper>
}

export default Tab
```

In this refactored code, the `TabWrapper` component is defined outside of the `Tab` component, and the required props (`isSelected`) are passed as arguments to the styled component. In the `Tab` component, the `TabWrapper` component is used and the `isSelected` prop is passed to it. This way, the `styled.li` component is only created once and the required props are used to create a dynamic style.
