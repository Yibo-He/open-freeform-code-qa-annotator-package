The issue is that `getCurrentPosition` is an asynchronous function, which means that the `else` block is executed before the user has a chance to allow or deny the geolocation request. To fix this, you can move the `else` block inside the `getCurrentPosition` callback function:

```
getUserLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position => {
      this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
      this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
    }, error => {
      console.log("User denied geolocation request");
    });
  } else {
    console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
  }
}
```

In this updated code, if the user denies the geolocation request, the error callback function will be executed and the message "User denied geolocation request" will be logged to the console.
