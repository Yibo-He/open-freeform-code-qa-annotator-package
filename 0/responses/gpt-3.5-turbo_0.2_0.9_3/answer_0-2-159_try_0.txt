Your code looks fine, but make sure that the image file "hologram.jpg" is in the same directory as your HTML file. If the image file is in a different directory, you need to specify the correct path to the image file. 

Also, make sure that the image file name and extension are correct. If the file name or extension is incorrect, the image will not display.

If the issue persists, try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page. Sometimes, the browser cache can cause images not to display properly.
