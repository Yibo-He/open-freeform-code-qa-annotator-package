The issue seems to be with how you are importing `AuthContext` in your `RegisterRoutes` component. You are importing it as a default export, but it is actually exported as a named export. 

To fix this, change your import statement in `RegisterRoutes` from:

```
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
```

to:

```
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

This should allow you to properly access the `isAuthenticated` property from the context.
