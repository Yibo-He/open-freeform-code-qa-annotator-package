You can extract the breakpoints from the Tailwind config file by accessing the `theme` object and looking for the `screens` property. This property contains an object with the breakpoints defined in your Tailwind configuration.

Here's an example of how you can extract the breakpoints and use them in your own mixins:

```
// Import the Tailwind configuration
const tailwindConfig = require('tailwindcss/defaultConfig');

// Extract the breakpoints from the configuration
const breakpoints = tailwindConfig.theme.screens;

// Define your own mixin using the breakpoints
const tabletPortrait = (content) => `
  @media (min-width: ${breakpoints.md}) {
    ${content}
  }
`;

// Use the mixin in your CSS
.my-class {
  ${tabletPortrait(`
    color: red;
  `)}
}
```

In this example, we're importing the default Tailwind configuration and extracting the breakpoints from the `screens` property. We then define our own mixin using the `md` breakpoint and use it in our CSS.

You can define your own mixins for each breakpoint by accessing the corresponding key in the `screens` object. For example, `breakpoints.sm` for the small breakpoint.
