Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in browsers using CSS media queries and JavaScript.

In CSS, you can use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for Dark Mode */
}
```

In JavaScript, you can use the `matchMedia` method to check if the `prefers-color-scheme` media query matches. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // User is in Dark Mode
} else {
  // User is not in Dark Mode
}
```

Note that this feature is only supported in modern browsers. If the browser does not support `prefers-color-scheme`, it will default to the light mode.
