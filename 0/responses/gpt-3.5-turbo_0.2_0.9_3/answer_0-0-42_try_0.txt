The error message is indicating that the `MongoStore` constructor needs to be invoked with the `new` keyword. This means that you need to use `new MongoStore()` instead of just `MongoStore()`.

In your `app.use` code, you are passing an instance of `MongoStore` to the `store` option. To fix the error, you should change the line to:

```
store: new MongoStore({ mongooseConnection: mongoose.connection })
```

This will create a new instance of `MongoStore` with the `mongooseConnection` option set to `mongoose.connection`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
