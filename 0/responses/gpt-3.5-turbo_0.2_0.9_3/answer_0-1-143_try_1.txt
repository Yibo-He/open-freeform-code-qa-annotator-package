To reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton, you can modify the browser's userChrome.css file. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Open Firefox and type "about:config" in the address bar. Press Enter.
2. Click on "Accept the Risk and Continue" if prompted.
3. In the search bar, type "toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets" and set it to "true".
4. Open your Firefox profile folder. You can find it by typing "about:support" in the address bar and clicking on "Open Folder" next to "Profile Folder".
5. If there is no "chrome" folder in your profile folder, create one.
6. Inside the "chrome" folder, create a new file called "userChrome.css".
7. Open the "userChrome.css" file in a text editor.
8. Add the following code to the file:

```
/* Reduce spacing between menu items */
#PanelUI-menu-button .panel-subview-body {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

9. Save the file and restart Firefox.

This should reduce the spacing between menu items in Firefox Proton. You can adjust the "padding-block" value to your liking.
