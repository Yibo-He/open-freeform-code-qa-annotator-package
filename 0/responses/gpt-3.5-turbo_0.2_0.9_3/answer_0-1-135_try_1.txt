This is a known issue in Safari where it does not properly calculate the height of flex items with images that have a width set and `height: auto`. One workaround is to set a max-height on the image instead of using `height: auto`. 

You can try updating your CSS to the following:

```
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  max-height: 100%;
}
```

This should maintain the aspect ratio of the image and prevent it from being stretched in Safari.
