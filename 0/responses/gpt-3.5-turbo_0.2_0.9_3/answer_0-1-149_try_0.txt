To achieve the desired animation effect, you can use the `transition` property in CSS. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired effect:

1. Add the following CSS to your `.link` class:

```css
.link {
  position: relative;
}

.link::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -2px;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background-color: #000;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: bottom left;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out;
}

.link:hover::after {
  transform: scaleX(1);
  transform-origin: bottom right;
}
```

2. Remove the `border-bottom` property from the `.link:hover` class.

The `::after` pseudo-element is used to create a line that will be animated on hover. The `transform` property is used to scale the line from 0 to 1 on hover. The `transform-origin` property is used to set the origin of the transformation to the bottom left corner of the line. The `transition` property is used to set the duration and easing of the animation.
