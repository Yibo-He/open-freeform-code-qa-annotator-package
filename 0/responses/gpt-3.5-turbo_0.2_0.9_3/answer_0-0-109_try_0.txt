Unfortunately, it is not possible to parse `undefined` values in JSON. According to the JSON specification, the only valid values are `null`, `true`, `false`, numbers, strings, arrays, and objects. 

If you have control over the API that is generating the JSON, you should modify it to use `null` instead of `undefined`. If you don't have control over the API, you could try using a regular expression to replace all occurrences of `"undefined"` with `"null"` before parsing the JSON. 

Here's an example in JavaScript:

```
const jsonString = '{ "name": undefined }';
const fixedJsonString = jsonString.replace(/undefined/g, 'null');
const parsedJson = JSON.parse(fixedJsonString);
```

Note that this will only work if the `undefined` values are represented as strings in the JSON. If they are actual `undefined` values, there is no way to parse them.
