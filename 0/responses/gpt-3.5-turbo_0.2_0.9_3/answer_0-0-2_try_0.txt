You can try using the `DomSanitizer` provided by Angular to sanitize the URL. Here's an example:

```
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-image',
  template: `
    <img [src]="sanitizedImgUrl" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
  `
})
export class ImageComponent implements OnInit {
  ImgUrl: string;
  sanitizedImgUrl: any;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {}

  ngOnInit() {
    this.ImgUrl = 'data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.sanitizedImgUrl = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustUrl(this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In this example, we are using the `bypassSecurityTrustUrl` method of `DomSanitizer` to sanitize the URL. We are also concatenating the `data:image/jpeg;base64,` prefix to the base64 image data before sanitizing it.
