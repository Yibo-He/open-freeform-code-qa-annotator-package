Based on the information you provided, it seems like `npm` is not installed on your system. 

You can try installing `npm` separately using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install -y npm
```

Once the installation is complete, you can check the version of `npm` using the command:

```
npm -v
```

If you still face issues, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `nodejs` and `npm` using the following commands:

```
sudo apt-get remove nodejs npm
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm
```

After the installation is complete, you can check the versions of `nodejs` and `npm` using the commands:

```
node -v
npm -v
```

I hope this helps!
