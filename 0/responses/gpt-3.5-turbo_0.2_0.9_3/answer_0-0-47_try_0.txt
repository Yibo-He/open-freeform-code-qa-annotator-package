You can define an interface that describes the shape of the objects in the array and use that as the type for the parameter. Here's an example:

```
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

Now, `products` is an array of objects that must conform to the `Product` interface, which means they must have a `name` property that is a string, a `price` property that is a number, and a `description` property that is a string. This provides a more strict type check than using `any[]`.
