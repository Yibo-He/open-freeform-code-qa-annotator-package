Yes, there is a better solution in JavaScript to check if a value is not null and not an empty string. You can use the following code:

```
var data; //get its value from db 
if(data && data.trim()) {
   // do something
}
```

This code checks if the `data` variable is truthy (not null, undefined, false, 0, or an empty string) and also checks if the trimmed value of `data` (removing any whitespace from the beginning and end of the string) is not an empty string. This is a more concise and efficient way to check for non-null and non-empty string values.
