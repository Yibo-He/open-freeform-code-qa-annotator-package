You can add a `displayName` property to your functional component to fix the ESLint error. Here's an example:

```
function Foos(props) {
  // component code here
}

Foos.displayName = 'Foos';

export default connect(
  mapStateToProps,
)(Foos);
```

By adding the `displayName` property, you are giving a name to your functional component that can be used by React for debugging purposes. This should fix the ESLint error you are seeing.
