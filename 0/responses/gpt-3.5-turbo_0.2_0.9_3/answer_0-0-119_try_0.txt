The issue seems to be with how you are importing `AuthContext` in `RegisterRoutes`. You are using a default import, but you have exported `AuthContext` as a named export. You should change the import statement to:

```
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

This should fix the issue and allow you to access the `isAuthenticated` property from the context.
