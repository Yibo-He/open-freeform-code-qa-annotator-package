Yes, it is possible to detect if the user's system is in Dark Mode in browsers. Here are some ways to achieve this:

1. Using the `prefers-color-scheme` media query: This media query allows you to detect if the user has set their system to use a light or dark color scheme. You can use it in your CSS to apply different styles based on the user's preference. Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Styles for dark mode */
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* Styles for light mode */
}
```

2. Using the `matchMedia` JavaScript method: You can use the `matchMedia` method to check if the user's system is in Dark Mode and then apply different styles accordingly. Here's an example:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Apply dark mode styles
} else {
  // Apply light mode styles
}
```

Note that not all browsers support the `prefers-color-scheme` media query yet, so you may need to use a JavaScript fallback for those browsers.

Also, keep in mind that the user can override their system's color scheme preference in their browser settings, so it's not always a reliable indicator of the user's preference.
