You can change the height of the `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by adding custom CSS to your component. Here's an example:

```
.mat-form-field-outline {
  height: 36px; /* adjust the height as needed */
}

.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-outline-start,
.mat-form-field-appearance-outline .mat-form-field-outline-end {
  top: 6px; /* adjust the top position as needed */
}
```

You can add this CSS to your component's CSS file or to your global styles file. This will reduce the height of the `mat-form-field` and adjust the position of the outline to match the new height.
