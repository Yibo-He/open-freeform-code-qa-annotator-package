The error message you are seeing is because TypeScript does not allow importing type declarations directly. Instead, you should import the module that exports the type declaration.

In your case, you should export the `AuthKeyT` type from a module in your project, and then import it in your React component like this:

```
// src/types/app.ts
export type AuthKeyT = string;

// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../types/app';

// use AuthKeyT in your component
```

Make sure that the path to the `app.ts` file is correct relative to the file that is importing it.

Also, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file has the `"baseUrl": "./src"` and `"paths"` set up correctly to allow for importing modules using the `@` symbol. For example:

```
// tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "./src",
    "paths": {
      "@types/*": ["./@types/*"]
    }
  }
}
```

With this configuration, you should be able to import your custom type like this:

```
import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app';
```
