The error message you are seeing is because TypeScript does not allow importing type declarations directly. Instead, you should import the module that exports the type declaration.

In your case, you should export the `AuthKeyT` type from a module in your project, and then import it into your React component like this:

```
// src/types/app.ts
export type AuthKeyT = string;

// src/components/MyComponent.tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../types/app';

// use AuthKeyT in your component
```

Make sure that the path to your `app.ts` file is correct. If it is located in a different directory, adjust the import path accordingly.

Also, make sure that your TypeScript configuration is set up correctly to include the `types` directory in the `include` section of your `tsconfig.json` file:

```
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
  },
  "include": [
    "src/**/*",
    "types/**/*"
  ]
}
``` 

This should allow TypeScript to find your custom type declaration.
