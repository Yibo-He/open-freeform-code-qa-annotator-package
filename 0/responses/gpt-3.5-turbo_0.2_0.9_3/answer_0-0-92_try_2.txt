It looks like the issue is with the `node` configuration in your webpack configuration file. The error message indicates that the `node` configuration object has unknown properties `module`, `net`, and `fs`. 

In Webpack 5, the `node` configuration object has been updated to be more restrictive. It now only accepts the properties `__dirname`, `__filename`, and `global`. 

To fix this issue, you can remove the `node` configuration object from your webpack configuration file, or update it to only include the valid properties. Here's an updated version of your webpack configuration file with the `node` configuration object removed:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  entry: './src/index.js',
  output: {
    filename: 'bundle.js',
    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),
  },
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.js$/,
        exclude: /node_modules/,
        use: {
          loader: 'babel-loader',
          options: {
            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  },
  devServer: {
    contentBase: './dist',
  },
};
```

This should resolve the issue you're seeing with the webpack configuration. Let me know if you have any other questions or issues!
