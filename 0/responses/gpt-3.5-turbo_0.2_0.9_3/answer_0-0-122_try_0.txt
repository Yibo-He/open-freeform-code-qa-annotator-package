To install an older version of `npm`, you can use the following command:

```
npm install -g npm@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the specific version number you want to install. For example, if you want to install version 6.14.4, you would run:

```
npm install -g npm@6.14.4
```

This will install the specified version of `npm` globally on your system. You can then check the version of `npm` by running:

```
npm -v
```

Make sure to communicate with your team to ensure everyone is using the same version of `npm` to avoid any compatibility issues.
