It seems like the package `aws-sdk-js` is not available in the npm registry or the version you are trying to install is not available. This is indicated by the `404 Not Found` error message in the log.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check if the package `aws-sdk-js` exists in the npm registry by visiting the following link: https://www.npmjs.com/package/aws-sdk-js. If it does not exist, then you will need to find an alternative package or contact the package author.

2. If the package exists, try installing a specific version of the package by running `npm install aws-sdk-js@<version>` instead of `npm install aws-sdk-js`. You can find the available versions of the package on the npm registry page.

3. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.

4. Try using a different npm registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/` and then running `npm install` again.

5. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file and then running `npm install` again.
