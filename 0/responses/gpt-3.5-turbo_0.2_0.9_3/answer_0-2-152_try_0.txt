It seems like you have not initialized the toast using JavaScript. You need to add the following code to your JavaScript file:

```
$('.toast').toast();
```

This will initialize the toast and make it visible on the page. You can also add options to the toast by passing an object to the `toast()` method. For example, if you want the toast to automatically hide after a certain time, you can add the `delay` option:

```
$('.toast').toast({ delay: 5000 });
```

This will make the toast disappear after 5 seconds.

Also, make sure that you have included the jQuery library before the Bootstrap JavaScript files. The order should be:

```
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>

```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
