The error message indicates that the `jmespath` module is missing. This is likely because the `nodejs10.x` runtime does not include this module by default, while the `nodejs8.10` runtime did.

To fix this issue, you need to add the `jmespath` module to your project's dependencies. You can do this by adding it to your `package.json` file and then running `npm install` to install the module.

Here's an example of how to add the `jmespath` module to your `package.json` file:

```
{
  "name": "my-lambda-function",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "jmespath": "^0.15.0"
  }
}
```

After adding the `jmespath` module to your dependencies, run `npm install` to install it. Then, redeploy your Lambda function and the error should be resolved.
