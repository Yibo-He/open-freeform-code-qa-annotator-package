It seems like you are trying to reload the current route in Angular. The code you have provided looks correct, but there are a few things you can try to debug the issue.

First, make sure that the `navigateToSelf` method is actually being called. You can add a console log statement to check this:

```
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  console.log('navigateToSelf called');
  this.router.routeReuseStrategy.shouldReuseRoute = () => false;
  this.router.onSameUrlNavigation = "reload";
  const self = ".";
  this.router.navigate([self]);
}
```

If the console log statement is not being printed, then the method is not being called.

If the method is being called, then try removing the `routeReuseStrategy` and `onSameUrlNavigation` lines and see if the reload works without them:

```
navigateToSelf(route: ActivatedRoute) {
  const self = ".";
  this.router.navigate([self]);
}
```

If the reload works without those lines, then the issue might be with those settings.

If none of these solutions work, then it might be an issue with the Angular version or some other configuration issue. In that case, you might want to try updating to a newer version of Angular or seeking help from the Angular community.
