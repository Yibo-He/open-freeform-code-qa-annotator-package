Based on the error message, it seems like the issue is with the `zsh` shell. It looks like the shell is unable to find the `zsh` executable file.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if `zsh` is installed on your system by running the command `which zsh`. If it is not installed, you can install it using your package manager.

2. If `zsh` is already installed, you can try reinstalling it by running the command `sudo apt-get install --reinstall zsh`.

3. If reinstalling `zsh` does not work, you can try resetting your default shell to `bash` by running the command `chsh -s /bin/bash`.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try resetting your terminal preferences to default by deleting the `~/.zshrc` file and restarting your terminal.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue with your terminal.
