Yes, it is possible to set the primary and secondary colors in your theme.js/theme.ts file. Here is an example of how you can do it using Material UI:

```
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

You can customize the primary and secondary colors by changing the values of the `main` property. You can also set other colors in the palette object, such as `error`, `warning`, and `info`.
