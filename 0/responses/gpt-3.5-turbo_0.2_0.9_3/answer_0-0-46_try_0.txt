It seems like there is an issue with the ESLint configuration file. The error message indicates that ESLint is unable to read the `tsconfig.json` file. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that the `tsconfig.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.

2. Check that the path to the `tsconfig.json` file in the `parserOptions` section of the `.eslintrc.js` file is correct. It should be relative to the location of the `.eslintrc.js` file. In your case, it should be `"project": "./tsconfig.json"`.

3. If the above steps do not work, you can try adding the following line to the `parserOptions` section of the `.eslintrc.js` file: `"tsconfigRootDir": "./"`. This tells ESLint to look for the `tsconfig.json` file in the root directory of your project.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try reinstalling the ESLint and TypeScript packages by running the following command in your terminal: `npm install eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin typescript --save-dev`.

After making these changes, restart your VSCode editor and see if the error message disappears.
