To reset a reactive object in Vue.js setup, you can simply assign a new value to it. In your code, you are already doing this for the `view` and `config` objects. However, you are creating new reactive objects instead of resetting the existing ones. 

To reset a reactive object, you can simply assign a new value to it using the `Object.assign()` method. Here's an example:

```
const resetViewState = () => {
  return {
    page: 1,
    size: 15,
    sort_label: "",
    search: "",
  };
};

let view = reactive(resetViewState());

const resetView = () => {
  Object.assign(view, resetViewState());
};
```

In this example, we define a `resetViewState()` function that returns a new object with default values. We then create a `view` reactive object using this function. To reset the `view` object, we define a `resetView()` function that uses the `Object.assign()` method to assign the default values to the `view` object.

You can use a similar approach to reset the `config` object and any other reactive objects in your code.
