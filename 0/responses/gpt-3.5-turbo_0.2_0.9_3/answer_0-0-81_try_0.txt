This error message indicates that the release build is unable to load the JavaScript bundle. There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that you have generated a release build of the JavaScript bundle by running the following command:
```
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

2. Check that the `index.android.bundle` file is present in the `android/app/src/main/assets/` directory.

3. If you are using ProGuard for code obfuscation, make sure that you have added the necessary rules to your `proguard-rules.pro` file. You can find the required rules in the React Native documentation.

4. If you are using any third-party libraries, make sure that they are compatible with the release build and that you have added the necessary configuration in your `build.gradle` file.

5. Try running the app in debug mode to see if you can reproduce the issue. If the app works fine in debug mode, then the issue is likely related to the release build configuration.

6. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new project and see if the issue persists. If it does, then it could be a problem with your development environment.
