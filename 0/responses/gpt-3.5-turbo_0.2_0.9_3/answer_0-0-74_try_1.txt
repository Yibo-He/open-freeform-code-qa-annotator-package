You can use the `window.history` object to get the previous URL. Here's an example:

```
componentDidMount() {
  // Save the current URL to local storage
  localStorage.setItem('previousUrl', window.location.href);
}

login() {
  // Perform login logic here
  // ...

  // Get the previous URL from local storage
  const previousUrl = localStorage.getItem('previousUrl');

  // If there is a previous URL, go back to it
  if (previousUrl) {
    router.push(previousUrl);
  } else {
    // Otherwise, go to the home page
    router.push('/');
  }
}
```

In this example, we save the current URL to local storage when the component mounts. Then, when the user logs in, we get the previous URL from local storage and use `router.push` to go back to it. If there is no previous URL, we go to the home page instead.
