The error message you are seeing is caused by the fact that you are trying to create an array with a length of 0. When you pass 0 as an argument to the `Array` constructor, it will throw a `RangeError`. 

To fix this issue, you can add a check to see if the object is empty before creating the array. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
const burger = (props) => {
  let transformedIngredients = [];

  if (Object.keys(props.ingredients).length !== 0) {
    transformedIngredients = Object.keys(props.ingredients).map(igKey => (
      // eslint-disable-next-line max-len,react/no-array-index-key
      [...Array(props.ingredients[igKey])].map((_, i) => <BurgerIngredient key={igKey + i} type={igKey} />)
    )).reduce((arr, el) => (
      arr.concat(el)
    ), []);
  } else {
    transformedIngredients = <p>Please add some ingredients!</p>;
  }

  return transformedIngredients;
};
```

This code checks if the object is empty before creating the array. If the object is empty, it sets the `transformedIngredients` variable to a message asking the user to add some ingredients. If the object is not empty, it creates the array as before.
