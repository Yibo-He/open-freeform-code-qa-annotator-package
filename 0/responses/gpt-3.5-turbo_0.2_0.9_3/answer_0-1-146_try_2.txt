One solution to this issue is to use Cypress' `within` command to get the width of the element relative to its parent element. This can help avoid issues with decimal places and ensure that the width is being measured accurately.

Here's an example:

```
cy.get('.parent')
  .within(() => {
    cy.get('.target').should('have.css', 'width', '200px');
  });
```

In this example, we're using the `within` command to scope the search for the `.target` element to its parent element with the class `.parent`. This ensures that the width is being measured relative to the parent element, which can help avoid issues with decimal places.

Another solution is to use Cypress' `round` command to round the width value to a specific number of decimal places. For example:

```
cy.get('.target')
  .invoke('width')
  .should('be.closeTo', 200, 0.01);
```

In this example, we're using the `invoke` command to get the raw width value of the `.target` element, and then using the `be.closeTo` assertion to check that it's within 0.01 of the expected value of 200. This can help avoid issues with decimal places by rounding the value to a specific number of decimal places.
