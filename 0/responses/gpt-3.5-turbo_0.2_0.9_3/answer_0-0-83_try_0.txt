It seems like there is an issue with the version of Chart.js you are using. The "linear" scale is not registered in the latest version of Chart.js. 

To fix this issue, you can try downgrading the version of Chart.js to a version that supports the "linear" scale. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install chart.js@2.9.4
```

This will install version 2.9.4 of Chart.js, which should work with your code. 

Alternatively, you can try using a different type of scale, such as "category" or "logarithmic", depending on your data. You can find more information about scales in the Chart.js documentation.
