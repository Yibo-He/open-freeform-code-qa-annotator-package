The error message you're seeing indicates that the Elasticsearch server is using a self-signed SSL certificate, which is not trusted by the client. To fix this, you can either disable SSL verification on the client side or use a trusted SSL certificate on the Elasticsearch server.

To disable SSL verification on the client side, you can set the `ssl.rejectUnauthorized` option to `false` in the Elasticsearch client configuration:

```
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  node: process.env.elasticsearch_node,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```

However, this is not recommended for production environments as it can leave your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.

To use a trusted SSL certificate on the Elasticsearch server, you can follow the steps outlined in the [official Elasticsearch documentation](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/configuring-tls.html) to generate and configure a SSL certificate. Once you have a trusted SSL certificate, you can configure the Elasticsearch client to use it:

```
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  node: process.env.elasticsearch_node,
  ssl: {
    ca: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/ca.crt'),
    key: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client.key'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('/path/to/client.crt')
  }
});
```

Replace `/path/to/ca.crt`, `/path/to/client.key`, and `/path/to/client.crt` with the paths to your SSL certificate files.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
