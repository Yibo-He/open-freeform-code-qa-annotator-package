It seems like the issue might be related to the way you are running the Vite server inside the Docker container. By default, Vite binds to `localhost`, which means that it can only be accessed from within the container itself. To make it accessible from outside the container, you need to bind it to `0.0.0.0`, which will allow it to accept connections from any IP address.

To do this, you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```
export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: '0.0.0.0'
  }
})
```

This should allow you to access the Vite server from your host machine using `localhost:8080`.

If that doesn't work, you can also try specifying the `--host` option when running the Vite server inside the Docker container:

```
npm run vite -- --host 0.0.0.0
```

This should have the same effect as setting the `host` option in the `vite.config.ts` file.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
