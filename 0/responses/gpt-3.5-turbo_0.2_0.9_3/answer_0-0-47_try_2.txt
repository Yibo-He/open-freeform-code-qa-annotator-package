You can use an interface to define the shape of the objects in the array. Here's an example:

```
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
  // function does stuff
}
```

This way, you can ensure that the objects in the `products` array have the correct properties and types.
