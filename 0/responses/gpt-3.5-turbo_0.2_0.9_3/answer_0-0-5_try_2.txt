It seems like the issue is with the node-sass package which requires Python to be installed. You can try installing a version of node-sass that does not require Python by running the following command:

```
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

This version of node-sass does not require Python and should work without any issues.

Alternatively, you can install Python on your Jenkins environment and set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable. This should resolve the issue with node-gyp.

```
set PYTHON=C:\Python27\python.exe
```

You can also try upgrading your Node.js version to the latest stable version as it may have better compatibility with node-sass and other dependencies.
