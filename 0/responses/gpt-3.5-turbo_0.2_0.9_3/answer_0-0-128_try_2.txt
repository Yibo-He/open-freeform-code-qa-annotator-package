To reset a reactive object in Vue.js setup, you can simply assign a new value to it. In your code, you can reset the `view` and `config` objects by assigning them new values returned by the `resetViewState()` and `resetPreRegisterConfig()` functions respectively. Here's an updated version of your `pageRefresh()` method:

```
const pageRefresh = () => {
  view = resetViewState();
  config = resetPreRegisterConfig();
  fetchProfilelist();
};
```

This will reset the `view` and `config` objects to their initial values returned by the `resetViewState()` and `resetPreRegisterConfig()` functions respectively.
