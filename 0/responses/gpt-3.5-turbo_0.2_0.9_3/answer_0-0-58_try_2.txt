This error occurs when the integrity check of the package fails. This can happen due to a network issue or a corrupted package. 

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force`.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file.
3. Run `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you can try updating your npm version to the latest stable version by running `sudo npm install -g npm@latest`. 

If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file, and then running `npm install --ignore-scripts`. This will skip the installation of any scripts defined in the `package.json` file.

If the issue still persists, you can try installing the package with the `--no-optional` flag, which will skip the installation of any optional dependencies. 

If none of these steps work, you can try reaching out to the package maintainer or posting a question on a relevant forum or community for further assistance.
