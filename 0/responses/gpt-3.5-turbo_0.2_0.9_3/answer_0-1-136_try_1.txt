The issue with your code is that the `parent` element has a `row` class, which is not defined in your CSS. You need to define the `row` class with `display: flex` to make the `parent` element a flex container and allow the child `section` elements to be aligned vertically. Here's the updated CSS code:

```
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: mandatory;
  scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  display: flex; /* add this line */
  flex-direction: column; /* add this line */
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

And here's the updated HTML code:

```
<div class="parent">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

With these changes, the vertical snap scrolling should work as expected.
