The issue you are facing is related to the fact that the `TextEncoder` class is not available in the Node.js environment, which is used by the Jest test runner. One way to solve this issue is to mock the `TextEncoder` class in your test file.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```
// Import the TextEncoder class from the 'util' module
import { TextEncoder } from 'util';

// Mock the TextEncoder class
global.TextEncoder = TextEncoder;

// Import the rest of your dependencies
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```

In this example, we're importing the `TextEncoder` class from the `util` module, which is available in Node.js. We then set the `TextEncoder` property on the global object to the imported class. This makes the `TextEncoder` class available in the Jest test environment.

You can add this code to the top of your test file and it should solve the `TextEncoder is not defined` error.
