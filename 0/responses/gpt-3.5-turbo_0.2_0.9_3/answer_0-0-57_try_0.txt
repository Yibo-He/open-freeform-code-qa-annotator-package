It seems like you are using the wrong syntax for hiding and showing elements in Angular. Instead of using `ngHide` and `ngShow`, you should use `[hidden]` and `[ngClass]`.

Here's how you can modify your code to hide and show the password input field based on the value of `isHidden`:

```
<div class="container">

  <div class="cont-login">
    <div class="login-pane">

      <div>
        <p class="inner log-labels">Your password</p>
        <input class="txt" type="password" [(ngModel)]="input_pw" [hidden]="isHidden">
      </div>

      <div>
        <input class="btn" type="submit" value="Login" (click)="isHidden = !isHidden">
      </div>

    </div>


  </div>

</div>
```

In this code, we are using the `[hidden]` attribute to hide the password input field when `isHidden` is true. We are also using `(click)` to toggle the value of `isHidden` when the login button is clicked.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
