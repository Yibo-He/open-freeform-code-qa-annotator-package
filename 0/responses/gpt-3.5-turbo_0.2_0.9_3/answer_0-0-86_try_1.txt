The issue is that the syntax for importing icons from `react-icons` has changed in version 3.0.0. Instead of importing from `react-icons/lib`, you should import directly from the icon's package. For example:

```
import { MdTerrain } from 'react-icons/md';
import { TiSnowflake } from 'react-icons/ti';
import { FaCalendar } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

Make sure to update your imports accordingly and the error should be resolved.
