This error occurs when the required `node-sass` module is not installed in your project. To fix this error, you need to install the `node-sass` module using the following command:

```
npm install node-sass
```

If you are using Angular version 8 or above, you can use the `sass` package instead of `node-sass`. You can install it using the following command:

```
npm install sass
```

After installing the required package, try running the `ng serve` command again and it should work without any errors.
