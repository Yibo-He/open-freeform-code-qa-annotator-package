To configure axios to trust the SSL certificate and correctly verify it, you can provide the `ca` option to the `https.Agent` constructor. The `ca` option should be set to an array of trusted certificates.

Here's an example:

```
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');
const axios = require('axios');

const trustedCertificates = [
  fs.readFileSync('/path/to/trusted/certificate.pem'),
];

const agent = new https.Agent({
  ca: trustedCertificates,
});

const result = await axios.post(
  `https://${url}/login`,
  body,
  {
    httpsAgent: agent,
  }
);
```

In this example, `trustedCertificates` is an array of trusted certificates. You should replace `/path/to/trusted/certificate.pem` with the path to your trusted certificate.

Then, you create an `https.Agent` instance with the `ca` option set to `trustedCertificates`. Finally, you pass the `httpsAgent` option to the axios request with the `agent` instance you just created.

This should allow axios to verify the SSL certificate using your trusted certificate.
