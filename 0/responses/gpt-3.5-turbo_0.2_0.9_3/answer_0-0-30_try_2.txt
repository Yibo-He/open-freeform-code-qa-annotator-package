Enzyme has not yet released an adapter for React 17, but you can still use Enzyme with React 17 by installing the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package instead of `enzyme-adapter-react-16`. 

To do this, first uninstall the `enzyme-adapter-react-16` package:

```
npm uninstall enzyme-adapter-react-16
```

Then install the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Finally, update your `src/setupTests.js` file to use the new adapter:

```
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

With this setup, you should be able to write and run Enzyme tests for your React 17 app.
