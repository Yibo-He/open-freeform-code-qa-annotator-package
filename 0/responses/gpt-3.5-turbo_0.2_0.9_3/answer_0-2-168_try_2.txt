The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is used to prevent a security vulnerability known as "tabnapping". This vulnerability occurs when a malicious website is able to hijack the contents of a newly opened tab that was created by a link with `target="_blank"`. The `noopener` attribute prevents the new tab from being able to access the `window.opener` property of the original tab, which could be used to manipulate the original page. The `noreferrer` attribute prevents the new tab from sending a `referrer` header to the original page, which could be used to track the user's browsing history.

While it is technically possible for someone to remove the `rel` attribute using Developer Tools, it is not a trivial task for the average user. Additionally, most users are not aware of this vulnerability and would not think to exploit it. Therefore, adding the `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is still a good practice to prevent this type of attack.
