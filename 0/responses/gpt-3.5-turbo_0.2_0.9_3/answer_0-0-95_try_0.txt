This error message suggests that there is an issue with the `postcss-scss` package. One possible solution is to try reinstalling the package by running the following command in your terminal:

```
npm install postcss-scss
```

If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling all packages by running:

```
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

If the issue persists, you can try upgrading your Node.js version or downgrading the `postcss-scss` package version to a previous stable version.
