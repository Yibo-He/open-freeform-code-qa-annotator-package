You can use `window.history.state` to get the previous URL in Next.js. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```
componentDidMount() {
  window.history.pushState({ url: this.props.router.asPath }, '', this.props.router.asPath);
}

componentWillUnmount() {
  window.history.back();
}

componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
  const { url } = window.history.state || {};
  if (url) {
    this.props.router.push(url);
  } else {
    this.props.router.push('/');
  }
}
```

In the `componentDidMount` method, you push the current URL to the history state. In the `componentWillUnmount` method, you go back to the previous page.

In the `componentWillReceiveProps` method, you check if there is a previous URL in the history state. If there is, you use `router.push` to go to that URL. If there isn't, you go to the main page (`/`).

Note that this solution assumes that the user has a history stack. If the user doesn't have a history stack, the `window.history.state` will be `null` and you will always go to the main page.
