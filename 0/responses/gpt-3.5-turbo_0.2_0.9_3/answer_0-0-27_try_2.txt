It seems like you are using a wrong URI for your GraphQL server. The URI you are using is a demo server provided by Apollo Client, which may not have the data you are trying to fetch. You should replace it with the URI of your own GraphQL server.

If you don't have a GraphQL server yet, you can create one using tools like Apollo Server or Hasura. Once you have a server, replace the URI in your `ApolloClient` configuration with the URI of your server.

For example, if you are using Apollo Server, your `ApolloClient` configuration may look like this:

```
const apolloClient = new ApolloClient({
    uri: 'http://localhost:4000/graphql', // replace with your server URI
    cache: new InMemoryCache(),
});
```

Make sure to replace `http://localhost:4000/graphql` with the actual URI of your server.
