This error occurs when the package you are trying to import does not have a main export defined in its package.json file. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the graphql-upload package has been installed correctly by running `npm ls graphql-upload` in your project directory. If it is not installed, run `npm install graphql-upload` to install it.

2. If the package is installed, try deleting the node_modules folder and running `npm install` again to reinstall all dependencies.

3. If the issue persists, you can try downgrading the graphql-upload package to version 13.0.0 by running `npm install graphql-upload@13.0.0`.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try using a different package for handling file uploads in GraphQL, such as apollo-upload-server or multer-graphql.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
