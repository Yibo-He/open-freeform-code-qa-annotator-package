The error message suggests that the browser process failed to launch because of a permission issue. You can try running the command with elevated privileges using `sudo`:

```
sudo node app.js
```

If that doesn't work, you can try changing the permissions of the Chromium executable file:

```
chmod +x /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

This should give the executable file the necessary permissions to run. 

Alternatively, you can try using the default executable path for Chromium:

```
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false, executablePath: 'chromium-browser'});
```

This should work if Chromium is installed on your system and added to the PATH environment variable.
