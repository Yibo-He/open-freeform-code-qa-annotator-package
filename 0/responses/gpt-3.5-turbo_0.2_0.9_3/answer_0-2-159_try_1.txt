Your code looks fine, and the image tag should work to display the image. However, there are a few things you can check to make sure the image is being loaded correctly:

1. Make sure the image file name and extension are correct. In your code, you have used "hologram.jpg" as the image source. Check that the file name and extension match the actual file name and extension of the image you want to display.

2. Check the file path of the image. If the image file is not in the same folder as your HTML file, you need to specify the correct file path in the "src" attribute of the image tag. For example, if your image file is in a folder called "images" that is located in the same directory as your HTML file, you would use the following code:

```
<img src="images/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500">
```

3. Check that the image file is not corrupted or damaged. Try opening the image file separately to make sure it can be opened and viewed correctly.

If none of these solutions work, try using a different image file to see if the problem is with the file itself.
