It seems like you are trying to patch the value of the multiselect dropdown with an array of numbers, but the dropdown options are objects with a label and value property. You need to map the array of numbers to an array of objects with the corresponding label and value properties.

You can use the `map()` method to achieve this. Here's an example:

```
const selectedDays = [1, 2]; // example array of numbers
const selectedDaysObjects = selectedDays.map(day => {
  return this.excludeDays.find(d => d.value === day);
});
```

This code will create a new array `selectedDaysObjects` that contains objects with the corresponding label and value properties from the `excludeDays` array.

Then, you can use this new array to patch the value of the multiselect dropdown:

```
this.form.patchValue({
  ... : ....
  excludeDays: selectedDaysObjects
});
``` 

This should select the correct options in the multiselect dropdown based on the array of numbers you received from the backend.
