To install an older version of `npm`, you can use the following command:

```
npm install -g npm@<version>
```

Replace `<version>` with the specific version number you want to install. For example, if you want to install version 6.14.4, you would run:

```
npm install -g npm@6.14.4
```

This will install the specified version of `npm` globally on your system. Keep in mind that you may need to update your `package.json` file to reflect the version of `npm` you are using.
