It sounds like you're trying to use a CSS preprocessor like Sass or Less, which allows you to write CSS in a more efficient and organized way. In Sass, for example, you can use the `&` symbol to reference the parent selector and create nested styles. Here's an example:

```
.parent {
  background-color: blue;

  & .child {
    color: white;
  }
}
```

This will compile to:

```
.parent {
  background-color: blue;
}

.parent .child {
  color: white;
}
```

Make sure you have a preprocessor installed and configured in your development environment. If you're using a framework like React or Angular, it may already be included.

As for switching to Sublime, it's a matter of personal preference. Sublime is a popular code editor with many useful features, but there are other options like Visual Studio Code and Atom that are also worth considering. Try out a few and see which one you like best.
