The issue is that `getCurrentPosition()` is an asynchronous function, which means that the code inside the `if` block will continue to execute while the browser is asking the user for permission to access their location. If the user denies permission, the code inside the `else` block will not be executed because it is outside of the `getCurrentPosition()` function.

To fix this, you can pass a second function as an argument to `getCurrentPosition()`. This function will be called if the user denies permission or if there is an error getting the location. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
ngOnInit() {
  this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
  if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
      position => {
        this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
        this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
      },
      error => {
        console.log("Error getting location:", error);
      }
    );
  } else {
    console.log("Geolocation not supported by browser.");
  }
}
```

Now, if the user denies permission or there is an error getting the location, the code inside the second function will be executed.
