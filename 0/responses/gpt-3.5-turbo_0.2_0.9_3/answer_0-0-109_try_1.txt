Unfortunately, it is not possible to parse `undefined` values in JSON. According to the JSON specification, `undefined` is not a valid value and should not be used in JSON. 

If you have control over the API that is generating the JSON, you should modify it to use a valid value instead of `undefined`. 

If you do not have control over the API, you can try to modify the JSON string before parsing it. One approach is to replace all occurrences of `undefined` with `null` using a regular expression. For example:

```
const jsonString = '{ "name": undefined}';
const fixedJsonString = jsonString.replace(/undefined/g, 'null');
const parsedJson = JSON.parse(fixedJsonString);
```

This will replace all occurrences of `undefined` with `null` and allow you to parse the JSON string. However, this approach may not work if the `undefined` value is used in a key or string value.
