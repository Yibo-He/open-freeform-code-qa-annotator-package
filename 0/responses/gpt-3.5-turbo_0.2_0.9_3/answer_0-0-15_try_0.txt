It seems like the issue is related to the way the API class is being exported and imported. 

When you use `export default API`, you are exporting the API class as the default export of the module. This means that when you import it using `import API from "utils/API"`, you are importing the default export of the module, which is the API class itself.

However, the error message you are seeing suggests that Jest is not able to find the constructor for the API class. This could be due to a problem with the way the class is being transpiled by Babel or with the way Jest is configured to handle ES6 modules.

One thing you could try is to change the way you import the API class to a named import, like this:

```
import { API } from "utils/API";
```

And change the way you export the API class to a named export, like this:

```
export class API {
...
}
```

This should make it clear that you are importing and exporting the API class itself, rather than the default export of the module.

If this doesn't work, you may need to check your Babel and Jest configurations to make sure they are properly handling ES6 modules.
