Enzyme has not yet released an adapter for React 17, but you can use the `@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17` package as a temporary solution. 

First, install the package by running:

```
npm install --save-dev @wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17
```

Then, update your `src/setupTests.js` file to use the new adapter:

```
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from '@wojtekmaj/enzyme-adapter-react-17';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

With this adapter, you should be able to write unit tests for your React 17 app using Enzyme. Keep in mind that this is a temporary solution until Enzyme releases an official adapter for React 17.
