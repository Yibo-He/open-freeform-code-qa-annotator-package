The error message suggests that the package `aws-sdk-js` is not found in the npm registry. This could be due to a temporary issue with the registry or a problem with your internet connection.

You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Check your internet connection and make sure it is stable.
2. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force` and then try running `npm install` again.
3. Try installing a different package to see if the issue is specific to `aws-sdk-js`. For example, you can try running `npm install express`.
4. If the issue persists, you can try using a different registry by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npmjs.org/`. This will set the registry to the default npm registry.

If none of these steps work, you can try reaching out to the npm support team for further assistance.
