This error occurs when the integrity check of the package fails. It means that the package you are trying to install has been modified or corrupted during the download process.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Clear the npm cache by running `npm cache clean --force`.
2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and the `package-lock.json` file.
3. Run `npm install` again.

If the issue persists, you can try upgrading your npm version to the latest version by running `sudo npm install -g npm@latest`. 

If none of the above steps work, you can try deleting the `~/.npm` folder and then running `npm install` again. This will remove all the cached packages and force npm to download them again. 

If you are still facing the issue, you can try using `yarn` instead of `npm`. Yarn is a package manager that is known to be more reliable and faster than npm. You can install it by running `sudo npm install -g yarn` and then run `yarn install` instead of `npm install`.
