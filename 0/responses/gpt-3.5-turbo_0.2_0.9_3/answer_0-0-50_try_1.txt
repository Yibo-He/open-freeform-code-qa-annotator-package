`"esModuleInterop": true` is a TypeScript compiler option that allows the use of `import` statements with CommonJS modules. When this option is set to true, TypeScript will generate code that uses `require()` to import CommonJS modules instead of using ES6 `import` statements. This is necessary because CommonJS modules do not have a default export, and ES6 `import` statements assume that the module has a default export. 

`"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true` is another TypeScript compiler option that allows you to import modules that do not have a default export as if they did have a default export. This is useful when you are importing a module that was written in CommonJS format and does not have a default export. When this option is set to true, TypeScript will generate code that uses `require()` to import the module and then assigns the default export to a variable that you can use in your code.

So, in summary, when you set `"esModuleInterop": true` and `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true`, you are telling TypeScript to generate code that is compatible with CommonJS modules and allows you to use `import` statements with modules that do not have a default export.
