It looks like the issue is with the way you are using `setState` in your test. Instead of passing `1` as an argument to `setState`, you should be passing `counter + 1`. Here's the updated test code:

```
it('increments counter correctly', () => {
  let wrapper = shallow(<Counter />);
  const setState = jest.fn();
  const useStateSpy = jest.spyOn(React, 'useState');

  useStateSpy.mockImplementation((init) => [init, setState]);
  const button = wrapper.find("button");
  button.simulate('click');
  expect(setState).toHaveBeenCalledWith(1);
});
```

Also, make sure that you have imported `React` at the top of your test file:

```
import React from 'react';
```
