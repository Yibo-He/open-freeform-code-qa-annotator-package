It looks like you are facing a dependency conflict issue between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One possible solution is to update the `eslint` version to a compatible one with `react-scripts`. You can try running the following command to install a compatible version of `eslint`:

```
npm install eslint@6.8.0 --save-dev
```

Then, update your `.eslintrc` file to use the installed version of `eslint`:

```
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "parser": "babel-eslint",
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module",
    "ecmaFeatures": {
      "jsx": true
    }
  },
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "node": true,
    "es6": true
  }
}
```

If this doesn't work, you can try removing the `babel-eslint` package and using the default parser that comes with `eslint`. To do this, remove `"parser": "babel-eslint"` from your `.eslintrc` file and run the following command to uninstall `babel-eslint`:

```
npm uninstall babel-eslint --save-dev
```

Then, run the linter again and see if it works.
