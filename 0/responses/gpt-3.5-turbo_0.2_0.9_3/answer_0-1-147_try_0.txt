Yes, in Laravel 8, you can install Bootstrap using the following command:

```
npm install bootstrap
```

After installing Bootstrap, you can compile your assets using Laravel Mix by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will compile your assets and create a `public/css/app.css` file that includes Bootstrap. You can then include this file in your HTML templates to use Bootstrap styles.

Alternatively, you can use a package like `laravel-mix-bootstrap` to simplify the installation process. To install this package, run the following command:

```
npm install laravel-mix-bootstrap --save-dev
```

After installing the package, you can include Bootstrap in your Laravel Mix configuration file (`webpack.mix.js`) like this:

```
const mix = require('laravel-mix');
const bootstrap = require('laravel-mix-bootstrap');

mix.js('resources/js/app.js', 'public/js')
   .sass('resources/sass/app.scss', 'public/css')
   .webpackConfig({
       plugins: [
           bootstrap({
               // Options go here
           })
       ]
   });
```

This will automatically download and include Bootstrap in your project, and you can customize the installation by passing options to the `bootstrap()` function.
