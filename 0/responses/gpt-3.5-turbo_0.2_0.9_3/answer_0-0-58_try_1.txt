This error is related to a failed integrity check of the package. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Clear the npm cache by running the following command:
```
npm cache clean --force
```

2. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file.

3. Run `npm install` again.

If the above steps do not work, you can try updating your npm version to the latest version by running the following command:
```
sudo npm install -g npm@latest
```

Then, try running `npm install` again. If the issue still persists, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file again, and then run `npm install --no-optional` to skip optional dependencies.
