The issue with the `querySelector` line is that it is looking for an element with both the `accordion` and `active` classes, but the `active` class is only added later in the code. So, it won't find any element with both classes at the beginning. Instead, you can simply remove the `active` class from all the accordion elements before adding it to the clicked one. Here's the updated code:

```
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function(event) {
  var acc = document.getElementsByClassName("accordion");
  var i;
  for (i = 0; i < acc.length; i++) {
    acc[i].addEventListener("click", function() {
      // remove active class from all accordions
      for (var j = 0; j < acc.length; j++) {
        acc[j].classList.remove('active');
      }
      
      // add active class to this one
      this.classList.add("active");
      
      var panel = this.nextElementSibling;
      if (panel.style.display === "block") {
        panel.style.display = "none";
      } else {
        panel.style.display = "block";
      }
    });
  }
});
```

Regarding the second issue, the `classList.toggle("active")` line is toggling the `active` class, so you don't need to add it again with `classList.add("active")`. You can remove that line.
