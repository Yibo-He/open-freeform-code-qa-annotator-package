The error message "Uncaught SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input" usually means that the JSON data you are trying to parse is incomplete or invalid. In your case, it seems that the `scatterSeries` variable is not a valid JSON string, so when you try to parse it with `JSON.parse()`, it throws an error.

Looking at your code, it seems that you are trying to push the parsed JSON object into the `scatterSeries` array. However, you are calling `JSON.parse()` on the `scatterSeries` variable itself, which is not a JSON string. Instead, you should call `JSON.parse()` on the `ch` variable, which contains the JSON string you want to parse.

Try changing this line:

```
console.info(JSON.parse(scatterSeries));
```

to this:

```
console.info(JSON.parse(ch));
```

This should parse the JSON string in `ch` and push the resulting object into the `scatterSeries` array.
