Based on the error message, it seems like the issue is with the `zsh` shell. One possible solution is to reinstall `zsh` using the package manager for your operating system. 

For example, if you are using Ubuntu, you can run the following command in the terminal to reinstall `zsh`:

```
sudo apt-get install --reinstall zsh
```

If you are using a different operating system, you can search for the appropriate command to reinstall `zsh`.

Once `zsh` is reinstalled, you can try opening the terminal again to see if the issue has been resolved.
