The issue you are facing is that the `TextEncoder` is not defined in the Node.js environment. One solution to this problem is to use a polyfill for the `TextEncoder` in your test environment.

You can install the `text-encoding` package and use it to define the `TextEncoder` before importing the TensorFlow encoder. Here's an example of how you can modify your test file to include the polyfill:

```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { TextEncoder } from 'text-encoding';
import * as mobilenet from '@tensorflow-models/mobilenet';
import App from './App';

// Define the TextEncoder before importing TensorFlow encoder
global.TextEncoder = TextEncoder;

it('renders without crashing', () => {
  const div = document.createElement('div');
  ReactDOM.render(<App />, div);
  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(div);
});
```

This should define the `TextEncoder` globally before importing the TensorFlow encoder and resolve the `ReferenceError: TextEncoder is not defined` error.
