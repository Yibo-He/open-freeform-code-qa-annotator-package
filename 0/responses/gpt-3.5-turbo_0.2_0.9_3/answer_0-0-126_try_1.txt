The error message indicates that the "target" property is no longer supported in Next.js 13. This property was used to specify the target environment for the application, such as "serverless" or "experimental-serverless-trace". 

Since you are not using the "target" property in your next.config.js file, the error may be caused by an outdated version of the Next.js build process on AWS Amplify. 

To resolve this issue, you can try updating the build process on AWS Amplify to use the latest version of Next.js. You can also try removing any references to the "target" property in your codebase, as it is no longer needed in Next.js 13.
