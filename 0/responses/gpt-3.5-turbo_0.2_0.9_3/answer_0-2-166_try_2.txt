You can use the `querySelectorAll` method to select the direct children of the div with class "section" using the `>` selector. Here's an example code snippet:

```
const sectionDiv = document.querySelector('.section');
const directChildren = sectionDiv.querySelectorAll('> div');
```

This will select all direct children of the div with class "section" and store them in the `directChildren` variable. You can then loop through this variable to access each direct child individually.
