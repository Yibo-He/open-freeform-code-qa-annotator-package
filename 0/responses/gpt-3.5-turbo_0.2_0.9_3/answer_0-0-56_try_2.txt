It looks like the issue might be with the port configuration in your `vite.config.ts` file. You have set the server port to `8080`, but you are also publishing the container port as `8080` in your `docker-compose.yml` file. This could be causing a conflict.

Try changing the server port in your `vite.config.ts` file to a different port, such as `8081`:

```
server: {
  port: 8081
}
```

Then, update your `docker-compose.yml` file to publish port `8081` instead:

```
ports:
  - "8081:8081"
```

After making these changes, rebuild your Docker image and run the container again. Then try accessing `localhost:8081` in your browser or using `curl` to see if the issue is resolved.
