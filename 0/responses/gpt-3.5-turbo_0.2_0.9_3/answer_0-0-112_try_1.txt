The error message indicates that the browser process failed to launch because of a permission issue. This could be due to the fact that the user running the command does not have the necessary permissions to execute the file.

To fix this issue, you can try changing the permissions of the file using the following command:

```
chmod +x /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium
```

This will give the executable file the necessary permissions to be executed.

Alternatively, you can try using the default executable path for Chrome or Chromium by removing the `executablePath` option from the `puppeteer.launch()` method. This should work as long as Chrome or Chromium is installed on your system and in the default location.

```
const browser = await puppeteer.launch({headless:false});
```
