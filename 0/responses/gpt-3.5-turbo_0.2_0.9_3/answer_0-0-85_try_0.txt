Yes, it is possible to set the primary and secondary colors in your theme.js/theme.ts file. Here's an example of how you can do it using Material UI:

```
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});

export default theme;
```

You can customize the primary and secondary colors by changing the hex values in the `main` property. You can also customize other aspects of your theme, such as typography, spacing, and breakpoints, by adding additional properties to the `createTheme` function.
