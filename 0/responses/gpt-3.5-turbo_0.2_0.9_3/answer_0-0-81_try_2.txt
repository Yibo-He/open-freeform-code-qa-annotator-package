This error message indicates that the release build is unable to load the JavaScript bundle. There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that you have generated a release build of the JavaScript bundle. You can do this by running the following command:

```
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

This command will generate a release build of the JavaScript bundle and place it in the correct location in your Android project.

2. Check that the `index.android.bundle` file is included in your release build. You can do this by opening the APK file and checking the `assets` folder.

3. Make sure that the `android:usesCleartextTraffic` attribute is set to `true` in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. This is required if your app is making HTTP requests over an unencrypted connection.

4. If you are using ProGuard to obfuscate your code, make sure that you have added the necessary rules to your ProGuard configuration file to prevent the JavaScript code from being obfuscated.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try running the release build on a physical device instead of an emulator. Sometimes emulators can have issues with loading the JavaScript bundle.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
