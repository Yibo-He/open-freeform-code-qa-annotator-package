Yes, in Laravel 8, you can install Bootstrap using the following command:

```
npm install bootstrap
```

This will install Bootstrap and its dependencies in your project's `node_modules` directory.

After installing Bootstrap, you can include it in your project by adding the following line to your `resources/css/app.css` file:

```
@import '~bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
```

And the following line to your `resources/js/app.js` file:

```
require('bootstrap');
```

Then, you can compile your assets using Laravel Mix by running the following command:

```
npm run dev
```

This will compile your assets and make them available in your `public` directory. You can then include them in your HTML templates as needed.
