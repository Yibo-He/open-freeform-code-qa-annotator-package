There could be several reasons why the live server extension is not updating the browser after you save your files. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the live server is running: Make sure that the live server is running by clicking on the "Go Live" button in the bottom right corner of your VS Code window. If it's not running, start it by clicking on the button.

2. Check if the browser is connected to the live server: Check if the browser is connected to the live server by looking at the address bar. It should show the URL of the live server (e.g., http://localhost:5500). If it's not connected, try refreshing the browser or restarting the live server.

3. Check if the files are saved in the correct location: Make sure that the files you are editing are saved in the correct location. The live server only updates the browser when the files are saved in the correct location.

4. Check if there are any errors in the console: Open the console in your browser and check if there are any errors. If there are errors, try fixing them and see if the live server updates the browser.

5. Try disabling any conflicting extensions: If none of the above solutions work, try disabling any conflicting extensions that might be interfering with the live server extension.
