This error occurs because the PowerShell execution policy is set to Restricted by default on Windows. To solve this problem, you need to change the execution policy to allow running scripts. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
2. Run the following command to check the current execution policy:

```
Get-ExecutionPolicy
```

3. If the output is Restricted, run the following command to change the execution policy:

```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

4. When prompted, type Y to confirm the change.

After changing the execution policy, you should be able to run the `expo` command without any errors.
