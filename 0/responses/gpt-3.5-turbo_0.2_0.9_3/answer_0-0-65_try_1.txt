The reason why `observed.current` is empty is because the `console.log` statement is executed before the component is fully mounted and rendered. 

To access the `div` element with all its properties, you can use the `useEffect` hook to log the `observed.current` value after the component has mounted:

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log(observed.current);
  }, []);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```

This will log the `div` element with all its properties to the console after the component has mounted.
