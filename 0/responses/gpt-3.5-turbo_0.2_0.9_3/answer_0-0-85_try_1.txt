Yes, it is possible to set primary and secondary colors in your theme.js/theme.ts file using Material UI. You can define a palette object with primary and secondary colors as shown in your example. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```
import { createTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

export const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: '#7bb9e8',
    },
    secondary: {
      main: '#eb7f7f',
    },
  },
});
```

You can then use this theme object in your React components by wrapping them with the `ThemeProvider` component from Material UI. Here's an example:

```
import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/core/styles';
import { theme } from './theme';

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      {/* Your components here */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

This will apply the primary and secondary colors defined in your theme to all Material UI components used in your app.
