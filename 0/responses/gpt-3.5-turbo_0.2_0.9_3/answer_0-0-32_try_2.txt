You can achieve this by using the Intersection Observer API. Here's an example code snippet that should work for your case:

```
const parent = document.querySelector('#parent');
const divs = parent.querySelectorAll('div');

const observer = new IntersectionObserver(entries => {
  entries.forEach(entry => {
    if (entry.isIntersecting) {
      console.log(entry.target.id + ' is visible on viewport');
    }
  });
});

divs.forEach(div => {
  observer.observe(div);
});
```

In this code, we first select the parent element and all the divs inside it. Then we create a new IntersectionObserver object and pass a callback function to it. This function will be called every time an observed element intersects with the viewport.

Inside the callback function, we check if the observed element is intersecting with the viewport by checking the `isIntersecting` property of the `entry` object. If it is, we log a message to the console indicating that the element is visible on the viewport.

Finally, we loop through all the divs and call the `observe` method of the observer object on each of them. This will start observing each div for intersection with the viewport.
