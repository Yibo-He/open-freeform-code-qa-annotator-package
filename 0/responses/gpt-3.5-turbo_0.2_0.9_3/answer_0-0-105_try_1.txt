It is not common to use both Cypress and Jest together, as they serve different purposes. Jest is primarily used for unit testing, while Cypress is used for end-to-end testing. 

However, there may be cases where using both can be beneficial. For example, if you have a complex application with many components, you may want to use Jest to test individual components and Cypress to test the application as a whole. 

Ultimately, the decision to use both or just one testing library depends on the specific needs of your project and the preferences of your team. It's important to consider the trade-offs of using multiple testing libraries, such as increased complexity and maintenance, versus the benefits of having a more comprehensive testing strategy.
