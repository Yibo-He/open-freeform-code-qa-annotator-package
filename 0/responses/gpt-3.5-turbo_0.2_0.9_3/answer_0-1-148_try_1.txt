You can achieve this by using the `group` feature in Tailwind CSS. Here's how you can modify your code to achieve the desired result:

```
<ul class="border-solid border-b border-black">
  <template v-for="(item, index) in items">
    <li
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="group last:border-b-0"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </template>
</ul>
```

In this code, we have added the `group` class to the parent `ul` element. Then, we have used the `last:border-b-0` class on the `li` element to remove the bottom border from the last item in the list.

The `group` class is used to create a context for the child elements. This allows us to use the `last` pseudo-class variant on the `li` element, which targets the last child of the `ul` element. The `border-b-0` class is used to remove the bottom border from the last item in the list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
