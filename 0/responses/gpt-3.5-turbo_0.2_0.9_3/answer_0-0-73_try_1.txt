It's possible that the issue is related to Tailwind's JIT compiler. When using dynamic class names with the JIT compiler, it can sometimes take a few moments for the changes to take effect. This could explain why the button suddenly started spanning two columns after you reverted to the original code.

One way to test this theory would be to try disabling the JIT compiler and see if the issue persists. You can do this by adding the following line to your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```
module.exports = {
  mode: 'jit',
  purge: [],
  darkMode: false, // or 'media' or 'class'
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
  corePlugins: {
    preflight: false,
  },
}
```

This will disable the JIT compiler and force Tailwind to generate all of the CSS classes up front. If the issue goes away with the JIT compiler disabled, then it's likely that the issue was related to the JIT compiler not updating the CSS classes quickly enough.

If the issue persists even with the JIT compiler disabled, then it's possible that there's a bug in your code or in Tailwind itself. In that case, you may want to try simplifying your code and see if you can isolate the issue.
