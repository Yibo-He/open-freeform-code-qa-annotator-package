The `rel="noopener noreferrer"` attribute is used to prevent a security vulnerability known as "tabnapping". This vulnerability occurs when a malicious website is able to manipulate the newly opened tab created by a link with `target="_blank"`. By adding `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, the link is prevented from accessing the `window.opener` property of the newly opened tab, which is what allows the malicious website to manipulate it.

However, you are correct that a user with access to the Developer Tools in their browser could potentially remove the `rel` attribute and still be vulnerable to tabnapping. This is why it's important to educate users on the risks of clicking on links from untrusted sources and to always be cautious when opening links in new tabs.

In addition to using `rel="noopener noreferrer"`, you can also consider using other security measures such as implementing Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on your website to further protect against tabnapping and other types of attacks.
