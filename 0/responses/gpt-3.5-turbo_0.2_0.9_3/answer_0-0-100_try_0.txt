It looks like you are running into a dependency conflict between `eslint` and `react-scripts`. One solution is to install `eslint-config-react-app` which is specifically designed to work with `create-react-app`. 

Here are the steps to install and configure `eslint` with `create-react-app`:

1. Install `eslint-config-react-app` as a dev dependency:

   ```
   npm install eslint-config-react-app --save-dev
   ```

2. Update your `.eslintrc` file to extend `eslint-config-react-app`:

   ```
   {
     "extends": "react-app"
   }
   ```

   This will automatically include the necessary plugins and configurations for `eslint` to work with `create-react-app`.

3. Run `eslint` again and see if the error is resolved:

   ```
   eslint src
   ```

   This should run `eslint` on your `src` directory and show any linting errors or warnings.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
