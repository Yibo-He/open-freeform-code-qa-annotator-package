The `npm install -g @vue/cli` command installs the latest version of the Vue CLI globally on your system. However, it does not update the version of Vue.js that you are using in your project.

To update the version of Vue.js in your project, you need to run the following command in your project directory:

```
npm install vue@latest --save
```

This command will install the latest version of Vue.js and update the `package.json` file with the new version number.

After running this command, you can check the version of Vue.js by running the following command:

```
vue --version
```

This should show you the latest version of Vue.js that you have installed in your project.
