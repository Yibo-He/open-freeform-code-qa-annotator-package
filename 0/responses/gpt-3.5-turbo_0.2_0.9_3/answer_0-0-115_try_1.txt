The warning you are seeing is because `create-react-app` does not support path aliases out of the box. However, you can still use path aliases by ejecting from `create-react-app` and configuring your own webpack configuration.

To eject from `create-react-app`, run the following command:

```
npm run eject
```

This will give you access to the webpack configuration files, which you can then modify to support path aliases.

Once you have ejected, you can modify the `webpack.config.js` file to include the following code:

```
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    alias: {
      '@store': path.resolve(__dirname, 'src/store'),
    },
  },
  // ...
};
```

This will create an alias for `@store` that points to the `src/store` directory.

After making these changes, you should be able to use path aliases in your TypeScript code without any issues.
