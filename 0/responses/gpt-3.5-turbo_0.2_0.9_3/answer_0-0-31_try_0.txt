Yes, there is a nullish version of `&&` called the Optional Chaining operator `?.`. It allows you to access nested properties or call functions only if the preceding value is not nullish. Here's an example:

```
const result = obj?.prop?.func();
```

In this example, `result` will be `undefined` if either `obj` or `prop` is nullish. If both `obj` and `prop` are not nullish, then `func()` will be called and its result will be assigned to `result`. This is useful when you want to avoid errors when accessing nested properties or calling functions on nullish values.
