This error occurs when the Gradle wrapper script is unable to download the Gradle distribution specified in the project's Gradle wrapper files. Here are some possible solutions:

1. Check your internet connection and try again. Sometimes, the download may fail due to a poor internet connection.

2. Try deleting the `gradle` folder in your project's root directory and run the `react-native link` command again. This will force the Gradle wrapper to download the distribution again.

3. If the above solutions don't work, you can try manually downloading the Gradle distribution and placing it in the `gradle/wrapper` directory of your project. You can download the distribution from the Gradle website.

4. Another solution is to update the Gradle version in your project's `android/build.gradle` file. You can try changing the `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.0'` to `classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.4.0'` or a higher version.

I hope one of these solutions works for you.
