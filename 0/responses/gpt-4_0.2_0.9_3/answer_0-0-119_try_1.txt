The issue is with the way you're importing `AuthContext` in your `RegisterRoutes` component. You're trying to import it as a default export, but it's not being exported as default from `authContext.js`. 

In your `authContext.js`, you're exporting `AuthContext` as a named export:

```jsx
export { AuthContext };
```

And `AuthContextProvider` as a default export:

```jsx
export default AuthContextProvider;
```

So, in your `RegisterRoutes` component, you should import `AuthContext` like this:

```jsx
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

This should resolve the issue.
