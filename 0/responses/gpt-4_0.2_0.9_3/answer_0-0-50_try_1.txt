The `esModuleInterop` and `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` options in the TypeScript configuration file are related to how TypeScript handles module imports and exports. They are indeed dependent on the `module` option, which in your case is set to `commonjs`.

Let's break down these options:

1. `"esModuleInterop": true,` - This option changes how TypeScript interoperates with CommonJS and AMD modules to be more compatible with Babel. When this option is set to true, TypeScript will emit some extra code around the imports in your compiled JavaScript files. This is to ensure that the default imports and exports work as expected when running the code in a Node.js environment, which follows the CommonJS module system.

2. `"allowSyntheticDefaultImports": true,` - This option is related to type checking of default imports. It allows you to use default imports syntax on modules that do not have a default export. This is useful when you're using a module that doesn't have default exports, but you want to import it as if it does for the sake of cleaner syntax or code organization.

The official documentation for `allowSyntheticDefaultImports` means that this option only affects how TypeScript checks types and does not affect how the code is outputted when it is compiled to JavaScript.

As for the StackOverflow question you linked, the user is asking if there's a way to use `esModuleInterop` in the `tsconfig.json` file instead of as a command-line flag. The answer is yes, as you can see in your own `tsconfig.json` file.

The `esModuleInterop` definition from the compiler page is saying that when this option is enabled, TypeScript will add some extra code to the compiled JavaScript to ensure compatibility with the Babel ecosystem. The `__importStar` and `__importDefault` are helper functions that TypeScript uses to handle imports and exports in the compiled JavaScript code.
