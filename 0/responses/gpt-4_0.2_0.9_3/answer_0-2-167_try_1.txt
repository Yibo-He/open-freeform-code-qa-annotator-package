There could be several reasons why your live server extension is not updating your browser after saving your HTML or other files:

1. **Browser Cache:** Your browser might be loading the page from cache. Try clearing your browser cache or use incognito mode to see if the problem persists.

2. **Auto Save:** Ensure that the Auto Save feature is enabled in your code editor. In Visual Studio Code, for instance, you can enable Auto Save by going to File > Auto Save.

3. **Live Server Settings:** Check your live server settings. Make sure that the "liveServer.settings.reload" is set to true. This setting will automatically reload the page whenever changes are made to the file.

4. **File Path:** Ensure that the file path is correct. If the file path is incorrect, the live server will not be able to detect the changes and update the browser.

5. **Firewall or Antivirus Software:** Sometimes, firewall or antivirus software can interfere with the live server. Try disabling them temporarily to see if that solves the problem.

6. **Port Number:** The default port number for the live server is 5500. If this port is being used by another service, it could cause issues. Try changing the port number in the live server settings.

7. **Extension Conflict:** There might be a conflict with another extension in your code editor. Try disabling other extensions to see if that solves the problem.

If none of these solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling the live server extension. If the problem persists, it might be a bug with the extension itself, and you should consider reporting it to the extension's developers.
