The code you provided seems correct. The `Switch` component is correctly placed inside a `Form.Item` and the `valuePropName` is set to "checked" which is the correct prop for a `Switch` component.

The `onCreate` function should receive an object with the values of the form fields. The key of each value is the `name` prop of the corresponding `Form.Item`. In your case, the `Switch` value should be under the key "switch".

Here is an example of how you can use the values inside the `onCreate` function:

```jsx
const onCreate = (values) => {
  console.log('Received values from form: ', values);
  console.log('Switch value: ', values.switch);
}
```

If you are not receiving the value from the switch, it might be because the `Switch` component is not being triggered or the form is not being submitted correctly. Make sure that the `Switch` component is working as expected (you can test it by adding an `onChange` prop and logging the value) and that the form submission is working correctly.

If you are still having issues, please provide more details about the problem and I'll be glad to help you further.
