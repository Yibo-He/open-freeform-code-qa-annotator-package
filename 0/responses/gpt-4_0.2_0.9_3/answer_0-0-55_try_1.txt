The problem with your code is that the `myInterval` variable is not preserving its value between renders. This is because every time your component re-renders, a new `myInterval` variable is created. So when you call `clearInterval(myInterval)`, it's not clearing the interval you think it is.

To solve this, you can use the `useRef` hook to store the interval ID. The `useRef` hook creates a mutable object with a `.current` property that you can change without causing a re-render.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";

export default function Counter() {
  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);
  const [isRunning, setIsRunning] = useState(false);
  const intervalRef = useRef();

  function startCounter() {
    setIsRunning(true);
    intervalRef.current = setInterval(() => setCounter((counter) => counter + 1), 1000);
  }

  function pauseCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }

  function resetCounter() {
    setIsRunning(false);
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    setCounter(0);
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>{counter}</p>
      <button onClick={isRunning ? pauseCounter : startCounter}>
        {isRunning ? "Pause" : "Start"}
      </button>
      <button onClick={resetCounter}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this code, I've made the following changes:

1. I've added the `useRef` hook and created a `intervalRef` variable to store the interval ID.
2. I've split your `incrementCounter` function into two separate functions: `startCounter` and `pauseCounter`. This makes the code easier to understand and maintain.
3. I've updated the `onClick` handler for the start/pause button to call `startCounter` or `pauseCounter` depending on whether the counter is currently running.
4. I've updated the `resetCounter` function to clear the interval using `intervalRef.current`.
5. I've removed the `flag` state variable and the `useEffect` hook because they are no longer needed.
