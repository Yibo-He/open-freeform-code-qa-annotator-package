As of now, React does not provide a hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch` or `getDerivedStateFromError`. Error boundaries, as of the current version of React (17.x), can only be class components.

The React team has mentioned that they are considering adding this in the future, but as of now, there is no hook for catching errors in function components.

You can follow this issue on the official React GitHub repository for updates: https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/11334

So, for now, you'll have to stick with class components for error boundaries.
