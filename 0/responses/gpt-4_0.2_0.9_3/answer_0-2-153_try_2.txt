In Tailwind CSS, you can apply a border to only one side of an element by using the `border-{t|r|b|l}-{size}` classes. 

For example, if you want to apply a border to the top of an element, you can use the `border-t-{size}` class. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t-2 border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

In this example, a 2px blue border will be applied to the top of the div.

If you want to apply a border to the right, bottom, or left of an element, you can use the `border-r-{size}`, `border-b-{size}`, or `border-l-{size}` classes, respectively.

However, if you want to make your code shorter and more maintainable, you can create a custom class in your CSS file and use it in your HTML. Here's an example:

```css
.border-top {
  border-width: 0;
  border-top-width: 1px;
}
```

Then, in your HTML, you can use this class like this:

```html
<div class="border-top border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This way, you only need to specify the border color in your HTML, and the border size and position are defined in your CSS.

As for the JIT mode in Tailwind CSS, it currently doesn't support passing parameters to classes. However, you can use the `@apply` directive in your CSS to create custom classes that apply multiple utility classes. Here's an example:

```css
.border-top {
  @apply border-0 border-t-1 border-blue-900;
}
```

Then, in your HTML, you can use this class like this:

```html
<div class="border-top">foo</div>
```

This way, you can apply multiple utility classes with a single custom class.
