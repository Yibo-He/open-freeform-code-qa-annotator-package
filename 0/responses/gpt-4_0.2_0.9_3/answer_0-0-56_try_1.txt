The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that Vite's server is binding to `localhost` (127.0.0.1) by default, which is not accessible from outside of the Docker container. You need to configure Vite to bind to `0.0.0.0` so it can be accessed from outside the container.

You can do this by modifying your `vite.config.ts` file to include the `host` option:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This will tell Vite to bind to all network interfaces, making it accessible from outside the Docker container. After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server at `localhost:8080` from your host machine.
