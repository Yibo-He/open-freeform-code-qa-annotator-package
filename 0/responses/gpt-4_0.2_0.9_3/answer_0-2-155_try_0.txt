You can change the height of the `mat-form-field` with `appearance="outline"` by overriding the default CSS styles. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Add a CSS class to your `mat-form-field` in your HTML file:

```html
<mat-form-field appearance="outline" class="my-mat-form-field">
  <mat-label>Input</mat-label>
  <input matInput placeholder="Placeholder">
</mat-form-field>
```

2. In your CSS file, override the default styles:

```css
.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-wrapper {
  padding-bottom: 0;
}

.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-flex {
  padding: 0.5em 0.75em;  /* Adjust as needed */
}

.my-mat-form-field .mat-form-field-infix {
  border-top: 0;
}
```

The `padding-bottom` in `.mat-form-field-wrapper` is set to 0 to remove the extra space at the bottom of the form field.

The `padding` in `.mat-form-field-flex` is adjusted to reduce the overall height of the form field. You can adjust these values as needed.

The `border-top` in `.mat-form-field-infix` is set to 0 to remove the extra border at the top of the form field when it is not focused.

Please note that these styles are specific to the outlined appearance of `mat-form-field`. If you use a different appearance, you may need to adjust different styles.

Also, be aware that overriding the default styles may affect the look and feel of your form fields, and may cause issues with error messages, hints, and other features of `mat-form-field`. Always test thoroughly after making these changes.
