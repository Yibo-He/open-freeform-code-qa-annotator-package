The error message suggests that there's an issue with the `postcss-scss` package in your `node_modules` directory. This could be due to a variety of reasons such as a corrupted package, an incompatible version, or a problem with your `node_modules` directory itself.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json` then reinstall dependencies**

Sometimes, the `node_modules` directory or the `package-lock.json` file can get corrupted, causing issues like this. You can try deleting both and then reinstalling your dependencies:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm package-lock.json
npm install
```

2. **Check your package versions**

Make sure that the versions of your packages are compatible with each other. In particular, check the version of `postcss-scss` and `next.js` you're using. You might need to upgrade or downgrade one or both of these packages to get them to work together.

3. **Check your Node.js version**

Ensure that you're using a version of Node.js that's compatible with your packages. You can check your Node.js version with `node -v`. If you're using an older version, you might need to upgrade.

4. **Check your code**

The error message suggests that a class is extending an undefined value. This could be due to an issue in your code. Even though you mentioned that modifying the code so it won't include any files or load anything still produces the same error, it's worth double-checking to make sure there's not a problem with the code itself.

If none of these steps work, please provide more details about your project setup, including the versions of `next.js`, `postcss-scss`, and Node.js you're using, and any other relevant information. This will help in diagnosing the problem.
