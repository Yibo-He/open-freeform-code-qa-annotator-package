The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) where you must explicitly declare if your app's components (activities, services, broadcast receivers) are able to be called from outside the app.

In your case, it seems like you're trying to set the `android:exported` attribute in the wrong place. You're trying to set it in the `<intent-filter>` tag, but it should be set in the `<activity>` tag.

However, since you're using Cordova and you can't directly modify the AndroidManifest.xml file, you need to use the `edit-config` tag in your config.xml file.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```xml
<edit-config file="app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml" mode="merge" target="/manifest/application/activity">
    <activity android:exported="true" />
</edit-config>
```

This will add the `android:exported="true"` attribute to the `<activity>` tag in your AndroidManifest.xml file when the app is built.

Please replace `true` with `false` if you don't want your activity to be accessible from outside the app.

Remember to replace `activity` in `target="/manifest/application/activity"` with `service` or `receiver` if you want to set the `android:exported` attribute for a service or a broadcast receiver.

Also, please note that you might need to add multiple `edit-config` tags if you have multiple activities, services, or broadcast receivers in your app.
