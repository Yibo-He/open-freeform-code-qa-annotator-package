The `truncate` class in Tailwind CSS only works for single line text. It sets `overflow: hidden`, `text-overflow: ellipsis`, and `white-space: nowrap` which means it will not work for multiline text.

If you want to truncate text that spans multiple lines, you'll need to use some custom CSS. Here's an example of how you might do it:

```css
.truncate-lines {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2; /* number of lines to show */
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your JSX:

```jsx
<div className="ml-1 inline-block">
   <span>Label: </span>
   <span className="font-semibold truncate-lines">
     long texttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt
   </span>
</div>
```

This will truncate the text after 2 lines. You can adjust the `-webkit-line-clamp` value to change the number of lines before truncation.

Please note that this solution uses `-webkit-` prefixed properties, which means it may not work in all browsers. It is supported in most modern browsers, but if you need to support a wide range of browsers, you may need to find a different solution.
