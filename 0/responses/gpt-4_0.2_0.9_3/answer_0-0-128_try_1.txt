In Vue.js, when you use `reactive()`, you are creating a reactive object. If you want to reset this object, you can't just assign a new object to the variable that holds the reactive object. This is because the variable is just a reference to the reactive object, and changing the reference doesn't change the original object.

Instead, you need to mutate the properties of the reactive object. If you want to reset the object to its initial state, you can create a function that returns the initial state, and then use `Object.assign()` to overwrite the properties of the reactive object with the properties of the initial state.

Here is how you can modify your `pageRefresh` method to reset `view` and `config`:

```javascript
const pageRefresh = () => {
  Object.assign(view, resetViewState());
  Object.assign(config, resetPreRegisterConfig());
  fetchProfilelist();
};
```

In this code, `Object.assign(view, resetViewState())` will mutate all properties of `view` to match the properties of the object returned by `resetViewState()`. The same goes for `config` and `resetPreRegisterConfig()`.
