The issue you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to import the icons. The import paths you're using are incorrect. 

The correct way to import icons from `react-icons` is as follows:

```javascript
import { MdTerrain } from "react-icons/md";
import { TiSnowflake } from "react-icons/ti";
import { FaCalendar } from "react-icons/fa";
```

Please note that the names of the icons are case sensitive and should match exactly with the names provided in the `react-icons` library. For example, it's `TiSnowflake` not `SnowFlake`, and `FaCalendar` not `Calender`.

Also, the import path has changed in the newer versions of `react-icons`. You should now import from `react-icons/<icon-library>`. For example, `react-icons/fa` for Font Awesome, `react-icons/md` for Material Design, etc. 

Please update your imports accordingly and your issue should be resolved.
