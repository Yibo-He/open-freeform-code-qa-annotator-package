The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that the Elasticsearch client is trying to connect to the Elasticsearch server over HTTPS, but the server is using a self-signed certificate. This is a common issue when using self-signed certificates, as they are not trusted by default.

To solve this issue, you have two options:

1. **Disable SSL verification**: This is not recommended for production environments as it makes your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, for development or testing purposes, you can disable SSL verification in your Elasticsearch client. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  node: process.env.elasticsearch_node,
  ssl: {
    rejectUnauthorized: false
  }
});
```

2. **Add the self-signed certificate to your Node.js application**: This is the recommended solution for production environments. You need to add the self-signed certificate to your Node.js application so that it trusts the certificate. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to get the certificate from your Elasticsearch server. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
kubectl get secret quickstart-es-http-certs-public -o=jsonpath='{.data.ca\.crt}' | base64 --decode > ca.crt
```

Then, you need to add the certificate to your Node.js application:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');
const https = require('https');

const agent = new https.Agent({
  ca: fs.readFileSync('path/to/your/certificate/ca.crt')
});

const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  node: process.env.elasticsearch_node,
  agent: agent
});
```

Replace `'path/to/your/certificate/ca.crt'` with the path to the certificate file you just created.

Remember, if you're using Docker, you need to make sure the certificate file is available inside your Docker container. You can do this by adding a volume in your Docker Compose file:

```yaml
volumes:
  - ./path/to/your/certificate:/usr/src/app/certs
```

And then use the correct path in your Node.js application:

```javascript
ca: fs.readFileSync('/usr/src/app/certs/ca.crt')
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
