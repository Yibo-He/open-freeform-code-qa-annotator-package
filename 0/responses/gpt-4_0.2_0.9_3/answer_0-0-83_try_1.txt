The error message you're seeing is related to the version of Chart.js you're using. In Chart.js version 3.x, the way scales are defined has changed. 

In your code, you're using the old way of defining scales which was used in Chart.js 2.x. 

Here's how you can define scales in Chart.js 3.x:

```typescript
options: {
  scales: {
    yAxes: [{
      ticks: {
        beginAtZero: true
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

However, if you want to stick with the old way of defining scales, you can downgrade your Chart.js version to 2.x. 

You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm uninstall chart.js
npm install chart.js@^2.9.4
```

This will uninstall the current version of Chart.js and install version 2.9.4.

If you want to use Chart.js 3.x, you need to update your code to use the new syntax. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
options: {
  scales: {
    y: {
      beginAtZero: true
    }
  }
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
