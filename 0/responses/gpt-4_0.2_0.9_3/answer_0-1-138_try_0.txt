Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode by using the CSS media feature `prefers-color-scheme`. This feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here's a basic example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

In the example above, the website will display a dark theme (white text on a black background) if the user's system is in dark mode, and a light theme (black text on a white background) if the user's system is in light mode.

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions.

If you want to detect this in JavaScript, you can use the `window.matchMedia` method:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
    // dark mode
}
```

This will return true if the user's system is in dark mode.
