The error message is not provided in your question, so I can't provide a specific solution. However, here are some common issues that might cause errors when sending emails with Nodemailer:

1. **Incorrect credentials**: Make sure the email address and password in the `auth` object are correct.

2. **Less secure apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You need to allow less secure apps to access your account. You can do this from your Google account settings.

3. **Two-Step Verification**: If you have Two-Step Verification enabled for your Google account, you'll need to generate and use an App Password in your `auth` object instead of your regular password.

4. **Nodemailer version**: Make sure you're using a version of Nodemailer that is compatible with your version of Node.js.

5. **Internet connection**: Make sure your server has an active internet connection and is not blocked by firewalls or other network restrictions.

If you're still having trouble, please provide the specific error message you're receiving for more targeted assistance.
