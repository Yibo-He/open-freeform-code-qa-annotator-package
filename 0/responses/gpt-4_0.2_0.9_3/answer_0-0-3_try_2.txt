The error you're facing is related to the linking of the `react-native-gesture-handler` library. Since React Native 0.60, the library uses auto-linking so you don't need to use `react-native link` command anymore. 

However, you're using React Native version 0.58.3, which doesn't support auto-linking. 

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. Uninstall the library:
```
npm uninstall react-native-gesture-handler
```

2. Reinstall the library:
```
npm install react-native-gesture-handler
```

3. Link the library manually. Open `android/app/src/main/java/<your-package-name>/MainActivity.java` and make the following changes:

```java
package com.reactnavigation.example;

import com.facebook.react.ReactActivity;
// Add the following import
import com.facebook.react.ReactActivityDelegate;
import com.facebook.react.ReactRootView;
import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView;

public class MainActivity extends ReactActivity {

  @Override
  protected String getMainComponentName() {
    return "Example";
  }

  // Add the following method to your main activity class
  @Override
  protected ReactActivityDelegate createReactActivityDelegate() {
    return new ReactActivityDelegate(this, getMainComponentName()) {
      @Override
      protected ReactRootView createRootView() {
       return new RNGestureHandlerEnabledRootView(MainActivity.this);
      }
    };
  }
}
```

4. Open `android/settings.gradle` and add the following lines:

```gradle
include ':react-native-gesture-handler'
project(':react-native-gesture-handler').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android')
```

5. Open `android/app/build.gradle` and add the following line in the `dependencies` block:

```gradle
implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
```

6. Run `react-native run-android` to build your project.

If you're still facing the issue, it might be related to the Windows environment. Try running the command prompt or PowerShell as an administrator and then run the `react-native link` command.
