The error message you're seeing is due to changes in Webpack 5. In Webpack 4, you could use the `node` configuration to mock or polyfill Node.js core modules, but in Webpack 5, this is no longer allowed by default. 

Here is the updated configuration for Webpack 5 according to the Antlr JavaScript documentation:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  //...
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "fs": false,
      "path": false,
      "os": false
    }
  }
};
```

In this configuration, `fallback` is used to provide replacements for built-in Node.js modules. Setting a module to `false` will tell Webpack to not provide any fallback.

Please replace your `node` configuration with the `resolve.fallback` configuration above and try again. This should resolve the error you're seeing.
