The warning you're seeing is because Vue 3 requires you to explicitly declare the custom events that a component can emit. This is a new feature in Vue 3 that helps improve the predictability and understanding of component behavior.

In your case, you're emitting a custom event `updatedcount` from the child component, but you haven't declared it in the component's definition. You can fix this by adding an `emits` option to your component definition, like so:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  emits: ['updatedcount'], // Declare the custom event here
  setup(_,{ emit }) {
    const store = useStore();

    const fired = () => {
      store.count++;
      emit("updatedcount", store.count);
    };

    return {
      store,
      fired
    };
  },
};
```

Now, Vue knows that your component can emit an `updatedcount` event, and it won't warn you about it.
