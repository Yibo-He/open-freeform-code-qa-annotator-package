The code you've provided seems to be correct for displaying an image in a div element. The `<img>` tag is the correct way to insert an image in HTML. However, there could be a few reasons why your image is not displaying:

1. **Incorrect Path:** The `src` attribute in the `<img>` tag specifies the path to the image. If the image is not in the same directory as your HTML file, you need to specify the correct path. For example, if your image is in a folder named "images", you would use `<img src="images/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500">`.

2. **Incorrect Filename or Extension:** Ensure that the filename and its extension in your `src` attribute exactly match the name and extension of your image file. Filenames are case-sensitive, so "hologram.jpg" is different from "Hologram.jpg" or "hologram.JPG".

3. **Image File Doesn't Exist:** Make sure the image file actually exists in the specified path.

4. **Browser Cache:** Sometimes, the browser cache can cause issues. Try clearing your browser cache and reloading the page.

5. **Broken Image:** The image file itself could be broken or corrupted. Try opening the image file directly in your browser to see if it displays.

6. **Server Issues:** If your HTML file is hosted on a server, there could be server issues preventing the image from being loaded. Check your server's error logs for any issues.

If you've checked all of these and the image still doesn't display, there could be an issue with your CSS or JavaScript that's preventing the image from being displayed. You would need to check your CSS and JavaScript code for any issues.
