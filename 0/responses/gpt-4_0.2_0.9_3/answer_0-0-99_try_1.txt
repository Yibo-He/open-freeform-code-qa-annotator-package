Sure, I can help with that. 

Angular's Validators.pattern uses JavaScript's RegExp object under the hood, so any regular expression that works with JavaScript should work with Validators.pattern.

Here's how you can create the patterns:

1) To allow only numbers, positive and negative:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+$/)
```

2) To allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places:

```javascript
Validators.pattern(/^[-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]{1,2})?$/)
```

Here's what these patterns do:

- `^` asserts start of a line
- `[-]?` allows an optional `-` at the start for negative numbers
- `[0-9]+` allows one or more digits
- `(\.[0-9]{1,2})?` allows an optional decimal point followed by one or two digits
- `$` asserts end of a line

These patterns should work for your use case. Let me know if you have any other questions!
