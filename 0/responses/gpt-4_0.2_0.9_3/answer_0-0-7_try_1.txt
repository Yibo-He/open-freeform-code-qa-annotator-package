The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that the `Telephone` property is being set as a string somewhere in your code before you log it. The `parseInt` method should work correctly if used properly.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
if (this.person.Telephone) {
    this.person.Telephone = parseInt(this.person.Telephone);
}
```

This will convert the `Telephone` property to a number if it's not undefined. 

If you're still facing the issue, then you might want to check other parts of your code to see if the `Telephone` property is being set as a string after you've converted it to a number. 

Also, ensure that the `Telephone` property is not being set as a string in the constructor of the `Person` class or anywhere else in your code.

If the `Telephone` property is being set as a string in the constructor, you can convert it to a number like this:

```javascript
export class Person {
    FirstName : string | undefined;
    Telephone: number | undefined;

    constructor(FirstName: string, Telephone: string) {
        this.FirstName = FirstName;
        this.Telephone = parseInt(Telephone);
    }
}
```

This will ensure that the `Telephone` property is always a number when a `Person` object is created.
