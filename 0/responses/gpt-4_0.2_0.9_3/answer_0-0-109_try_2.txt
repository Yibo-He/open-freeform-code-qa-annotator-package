The `undefined` value is not valid in JSON. JSON only allows the following value types: `string`, `number`, `object`, `array`, `true`, `false`, `null`. 

If you're dealing with JSON data that includes `undefined` values, you'll need to preprocess the JSON string to handle these values before parsing it. 

Here's an example of how you might do this in JavaScript:

```javascript
let jsonString = '{ "name": undefined}';
jsonString = jsonString.replace(/undefined/g, 'null');
let parsed = JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

In this example, all `undefined` values are replaced with `null` before parsing the JSON string. This is just one approach, and you might need to adjust it based on your specific needs.

For your actual JSON data, you can use the same approach. Just replace the `jsonString` with your actual JSON data. 

Please note that this approach assumes that `undefined` values should be replaced with `null`. If you need a different behavior, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
