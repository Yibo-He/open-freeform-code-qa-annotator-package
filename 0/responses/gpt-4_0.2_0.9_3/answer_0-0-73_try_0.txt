The issue you're experiencing is due to the Just-In-Time (JIT) mode of Tailwind CSS. In JIT mode, Tailwind CSS generates styles on-demand as you use them, which is different from the default mode where all possible styles are generated at build time.

When you use template literals to generate class names dynamically (like `col-span-${colSpan}`), the JIT compiler doesn't recognize these as valid class names during the build process because it can't predict the possible values of `colSpan` and `rowSpan`.

When you pasted the HTML from the Tailwind tutorial, the `col-span-2` class was used in the code, so the JIT compiler recognized it and generated the corresponding styles. That's why the button started spanning two columns after you pasted the HTML and then undid the changes.

To solve this issue, you can:

1. Disable JIT mode in your Tailwind CSS configuration. This will generate all possible styles at build time, but will also increase the size of your CSS file.

2. Explicitly use the `col-span-2` class somewhere in your code so the JIT compiler can recognize it. This can be a comment in your CSS file like this:

```css
/* classes for JIT compiler
col-span-2
*/
```

3. If you're using Tailwind CSS v2.2.0 or later, you can use the `@apply` directive with arbitrary expressions in your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .col-span-2 {
    @apply col-span-2;
  }
}
```

This will ensure that the `col-span-2` class is always generated by the JIT compiler.
