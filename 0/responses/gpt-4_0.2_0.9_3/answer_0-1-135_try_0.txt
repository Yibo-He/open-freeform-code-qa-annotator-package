This is indeed a known issue with Safari and flexbox. Safari has some issues with flexbox and `height:auto`. 

A workaround for this issue is to use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will prevent Safari from stretching the image.

Here's the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should make your images display correctly in Safari.
