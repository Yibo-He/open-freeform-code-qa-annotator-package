Yes, there is a way to run only one test in Cypress. You can use the `.only` method to achieve this. 

If you have a suite of tests and you only want to run one, you can use `it.only` to specify the test you want to run. Here's an example:

```javascript
describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  it('Test Case 1', () => {
    // Test Case 1 code
  });

  it.only('Test Case 2', () => {
    // Test Case 2 code
  });

  it('Test Case 3', () => {
    // Test Case 3 code
  });

  // More tests...
});
```

In this example, only "Test Case 2" will run. 

Similarly, if you want to run a specific suite of tests, you can use `describe.only`:

```javascript
describe.only('My Test Suite 1', () => {
  // Tests...
});

describe('My Test Suite 2', () => {
  // Tests...
});
```

In this example, only the tests in "My Test Suite 1" will run.

Remember to remove `.only` after you're done, or else only that test or suite will run in the future.
