It seems like you've forgotten to include the error message you get when you run `npm -v`. However, if you've installed Node.js but npm is not working, it's possible that npm was not installed correctly or at all.

Here are some steps you can try to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall nodejs and npm:
   ```
   sudo apt-get purge nodejs npm
   ```

2. Clean npm cache:
   ```
   sudo npm cache clean -f
   ```

3. Install nvm (Node Version Manager). It will allow you to install any version of Node.js along with npm:
   ```
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
   ```

4. Close terminal and open it again. Verify that nvm is installed by typing:
   ```
   nvm --version
   ```

5. Now install Node.js using nvm:
   ```
   nvm install node
   ```

6. Verify that Node.js and npm are installed by typing:
   ```
   node -v
   npm -v
   ```

This should solve your issue. If it doesn't, please provide the error message you're getting when you run `npm -v`.
