The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server configuration. By default, Vite's development server only accepts connections from localhost for security reasons. This means that when you're running Vite inside a Docker container, it won't accept connections from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to configure Vite to accept connections from any origin. You can do this by setting the `host` option to `0.0.0.0` in your Vite configuration file. Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0', // Accept connections from any origin
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

After making this change, you should be able to access your Vite server from outside the Docker container.
