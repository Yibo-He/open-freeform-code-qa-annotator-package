The error message you're seeing is because Chart.js 3.x has some breaking changes compared to Chart.js 2.x. The scale type 'linear' is no longer registered by default. 

You need to import and register it manually. Here's how you can do it:

```typescript
import { Chart, LinearScale } from 'chart.js';

Chart.register(LinearScale);
```

Also, the way to define scales has changed in Chart.js 3.x. Here's how you can define scales in your chart options:

```typescript
options: {
  scales: {
    y: {
      type: 'linear', // this would be unnecessary if the scale name is 'y'
      beginAtZero: true
    }
  }
}
```

Please make sure to check the Chart.js 3.x migration guide for more details: https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/getting-started/v3-migration.html

If you're still having issues, it might be easier to downgrade to Chart.js 2.x if you don't need the new features in 3.x. You can do this by running `npm uninstall chart.js` and then `npm install chart.js@^2.9.4`.
