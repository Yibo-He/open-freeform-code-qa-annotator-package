The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter to it. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a custom class to your accordion button. Let's call it `custom-accordion-button`.

```html
<button class="accordion-button custom-accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

Then, in your CSS, you can apply a filter to change the color of the arrow. Here's how you can do it:

```css
.custom-accordion-button::after {
    /* This is a Bootstrap 5 built-in class for accordion button */
    /* You can change the color by adjusting the hue-rotate degree */
    filter: invert(36%) sepia(93%) saturate(3443%) hue-rotate(106deg) brightness(102%) contrast(104%);
}
```

The `filter` property applies graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

In this case, we're using a combination of different filter functions to achieve the desired color. You can adjust the values to get the exact color you want.

Please note that this solution might not work in all browsers, as the support for CSS filters is not universal.
