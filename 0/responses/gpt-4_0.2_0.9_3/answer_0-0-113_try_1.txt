Both `fireEvent.click(element)` and `userEvent.click(element)` are used to simulate a click event on a DOM element. However, they do so in slightly different ways and are used in different contexts.

`fireEvent.click(element)` is a part of the `@testing-library/dom` package and it directly triggers the click event on the element. It's a low-level function that doesn't take into account the sequence of events that would happen in a real user interaction.

On the other hand, `userEvent.click(element)` is a part of the `@testing-library/user-event` package and it simulates a real user interaction. It triggers a sequence of events like `mouseDown`, `mouseUp`, `click`, etc., which would happen when a real user clicks on an element. It's a higher-level function and is recommended for most use cases because it more closely simulates user behavior.

In your example, both methods are correctly implemented, but `userEvent.click(element)` would be the recommended way to simulate a click event because it more closely matches what would happen in a real user interaction.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```jsx
const mockFunction = jest.fn(() => console.info('button clicked'));
const { getByTestId } = render(<MyAwesomeButton onClick={mockFunction} />);
const myAwesomeButton = getByTestId('my-awesome-button');

// Solution A
fireEvent.click(myAwesomeButton); // You missed to call click method of fireEvent
expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1); // There was a typo in your code

// Solution B
userEvent.click(myAwesomeButton);
expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
```

Remember to import `fireEvent` from `@testing-library/react` and `userEvent` from `@testing-library/user-event` at the top of your test file.
