In your case, you can use a keydown event listener to detect when the "Enter" key is pressed. You can add this listener to the editor instance in the `mounted()` lifecycle hook. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```javascript
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [
      StarterKit,
      Keymap({
        "Enter": ({ state, dispatch }) => {
          // Submit the chat and clear the editor
          this.submitChat();
          this.clearEditor();
          return true;
        },
      }),
    ],
    content: this.value,
  });

  editor.on("update", (e) => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  this.editor = editor;
},

methods: {
  submitChat() {
    // Submit the chat
    console.log('Chat submitted: ', this.editor.getHTML());
  },
  clearEditor() {
    // Clear the editor
    this.editor.clearContent();
  },
},
```

In this code, the `Keymap` extension is used to listen for the "Enter" key press. When the "Enter" key is pressed, the `submitChat` and `clearEditor` methods are called. The `submitChat` method is where you would put your code to submit the chat. The `clearEditor` method is used to clear the editor's content.

Please note that you need to import the `Keymap` extension from `tiptap-extensions`:

```javascript
import { Keymap } from 'tiptap-extensions'
```

Also, please note that the `clearContent` method is not a built-in method of tiptap's `Editor` class. You may need to implement it yourself or use the `setContent` method with an empty string to clear the editor's content:

```javascript
clearEditor() {
  // Clear the editor
  this.editor.setContent('');
},
```

Please replace the `submitChat` and `clearEditor` methods with your actual implementation.
