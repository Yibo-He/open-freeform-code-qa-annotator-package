It seems like you're on the right track. The Angular's DomSanitizer service is used to tell Angular that the value is safe to use in the specified context. The bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl method is used to bypass the security trust of a Resource URL.

Here's how you can use it:

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer } from '@angular/platform-browser';

constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) { }

getSafeUrl() {
    return this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('data:image/jpeg;base64,' + this.inspectionDetails.reportImage);
}
```

And in your HTML:

```html
<img [src]="getSafeUrl()" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```

This should work if `inspectionDetails.reportImage` is a valid base64 image string. If it still doesn't work, you might want to check the value of `inspectionDetails.reportImage` to ensure it's a valid base64 image string.
