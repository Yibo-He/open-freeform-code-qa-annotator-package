The error message is indicating that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function. However, in your code, you are not providing a callback function to `req.logout()`. 

The `req.logout()` function is used to terminate a login session. It's part of Passport.js, which provides comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

In your case, you can simply ignore the callback function because you don't need to do anything after the logout. So, your logout route should look like this:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout();
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        res.redirect("/"); //Inside a callbackâ€¦ bulletproof!
    });
});
```

In this code, `req.session.destroy()` is used to remove the session and ensure the user is logged out completely. The `res.redirect("/")` is inside a callback to make sure the session is destroyed before redirecting the user.

Please try this and let me know if it works.
