The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are some things you could try:

1. **Check your network connection**: Make sure your device/emulator has a working internet connection. You can test this by trying to fetch data from another API.

2. **Check the server**: The server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io' might be down or not responding. You can check this by trying to access the server in your web browser or using a tool like Postman.

3. **Check the query**: Make sure the query you're sending is correct and the server is able to respond to it. You can test this by running the query in a GraphQL playground connected to the server.

4. **Check for errors**: The `useQuery` hook should return an `error` object if the query fails. You can log this object to see if it contains any useful information. If `error` is `undefined`, it means that the query is still loading or it was successful.

5. **Check your Apollo Client setup**: Make sure you've set up Apollo Client correctly. This includes setting the correct `uri` in the `ApolloClient` constructor and wrapping your component tree with the `ApolloProvider` component.

6. **Update your dependencies**: There might be a bug in the version of `@apollo/client` or `react-native` you're using. Try updating to the latest version.

7. **Check your React Native environment**: There might be an issue with your React Native environment. Try creating a new React Native project and see if you can fetch data in that project.

8. **Try using `fetchPolicy`**: You can pass `fetchPolicy: 'no-cache'` to `useQuery` to ensure the query is sent to the server and not just trying to fetch from the cache.

```jsx
const { loading, error, data } = useQuery(EXCHANGE_RATES, { fetchPolicy: 'no-cache' });
```

If none of these suggestions work, please provide more information about your environment and the exact error message you're seeing (if any).
