Yes, there is a more concise way to check if a value is not null and not an empty string in JavaScript. You can simply use:

```javascript
var data; //get its value from db 
if(data) {
   // do something
}
```

In JavaScript, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), and `document.all` are considered falsy values. So, if `data` is `null` or an empty string, the condition in the `if` statement will be `false` and the code inside the `if` block will not be executed. 

However, please note that this will also exclude `0` and `false`, so if these are valid values for `data` in your case, you might want to stick with your original code.
