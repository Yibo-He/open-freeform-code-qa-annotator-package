The issue you're experiencing is likely due to Vite's server defaulting to localhost, which in the context of a Docker container, is the container itself. This means that the server is not accessible from outside the container.

To fix this, you need to tell Vite to listen on all network interfaces, not just localhost. You can do this by setting the `host` option in the `server` section of your Vite config to `0.0.0.0`.

Here's how you can modify your `vite.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import vue from '@vitejs/plugin-vue'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    resolve: { alias: { '@': '/src' } },
    plugins: [vue()],
    server: {
        host: '0.0.0.0',
        port: 8080
    }
})
```

This tells Vite to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible from outside the Docker container.
