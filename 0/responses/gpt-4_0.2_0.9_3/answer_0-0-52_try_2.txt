The Angular CLI does not currently provide a direct command to remove packages added via `ng add`. However, you can manually remove the package by following these steps:

1. Remove the package from your `package.json` file.
2. Run `npm uninstall <package>` or `yarn remove <package>` (depending on your package manager) in your terminal to remove the package from your `node_modules` folder and update your `package-lock.json` or `yarn.lock` file.
3. If the package added any additional configuration to your project (e.g., in your `angular.json` file or elsewhere), you'll need to manually remove or revert those changes.
4. If the package added any import statements in your project files, you'll need to remove those as well.

Remember to replace `<package>` with the name of the package you want to remove.

Please note that this process can be error-prone, especially if the package made extensive modifications to your project. Always make sure to have a backup or use version control so you can revert changes if necessary.
