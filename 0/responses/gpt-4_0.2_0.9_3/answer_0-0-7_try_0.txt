The error message you're getting suggests that the JSON value for `Telephone` is not being converted to a number before it's assigned to `person.Telephone`.

The `parseInt()` function should work as expected. However, it's possible that the `telephone` value you're passing to `parseInt()` is not a string representation of a number. 

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
this.person.Telephone = Number(telephone);
```

or 

```javascript
this.person.Telephone = +telephone;
```

Both of these will convert the string to a number.

If you're still having trouble, you might want to check the value of `telephone` before you try to convert it. You can do this with a `console.log()` statement:

```javascript
console.log(telephone);
this.person.Telephone = Number(telephone);
```

This will print the value of `telephone` to the console, which might help you figure out why it's not being converted to a number.
