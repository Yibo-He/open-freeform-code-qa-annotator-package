1) To move the stop button at the top to properly align with the begin button, you can use the `top` property in CSS. The `top` property affects the vertical position of a positioned element. This property has no effect on non-positioned elements. Here is how you can do it:

```css
#StopBtn{
    position: fixed;
    left: 500px;
    top: 10px; /* Add this line */
    /* Rest of your CSS */
}
```

2) To slightly move the bottom arrows up so they would display properly, you can use the `bottom` property in CSS. The `bottom` property affects the vertical position of a positioned element. This property has no effect on non-positioned elements. Here is how you can do it:

```css
#controls {
    padding-left: 350px;
    position: fixed; /* Add this line */
    bottom: 10px; /* Add this line */
}
```

3) To add color on the text "Points Earned" and "click to start the game", you can use the `color` property in CSS. The `color` property sets the color of the text. Here is how you can do it:

```css
.Points {
    color: red; /* Add this line */
}

.Status {
    color: blue; /* Add this line */
}
```

You can replace `red` and `blue` with any color you want.
