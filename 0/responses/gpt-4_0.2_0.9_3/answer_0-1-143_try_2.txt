Yes, you can modify the userChrome.css file to change the spacing between menu items in Firefox. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, you need to make sure that Firefox is set to allow the use of userChrome.css. To do this, type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Accept the risk and continue, then in the search bar type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and make sure it's set to `true`. If not, double click it to change its value.

2. Next, you need to find your Firefox profile folder. Type `about:support` in the address bar and press Enter. In the "Application Basics" section, click on "Open Directory" next to "Profile Directory". This will open your profile directory in your file explorer.

3. In your profile directory, look for a folder named `chrome`. If it doesn't exist, create it. Inside the `chrome` folder, look for a file named `userChrome.css`. If it doesn't exist, create it.

4. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor. To reduce the spacing between menu items, add the following code:

```css
/* Reduce spacing on menus */
menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}

/* Reduce spacing on context menus */
#contentAreaContextMenu menuitem, #contentAreaContextMenu menu {
  padding-block: 4px !important;
}
```

5. Save the `userChrome.css` file and restart Firefox. The changes should now be applied.

The `padding-block: 4px !important;` line is what controls the spacing. You can adjust the `4px` value to increase or decrease the spacing as you see fit.
