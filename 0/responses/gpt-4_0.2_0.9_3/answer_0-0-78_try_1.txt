Vue Router doesn't have a built-in way to prevent a route from being added to the history. However, you can use a workaround to achieve this.

You can use `replace()` method instead of `push()` method. The `replace()` method doesn't add a new record but replaces the current record in the history stack.

So, instead of:

```javascript
this.$router.push({path: "/loading"});
```

You can use:

```javascript
this.$router.replace({path: "/loading"});
```

This way, when the user clicks the back button on the results page, they will be taken back to the main screen instead of the loading screen.
