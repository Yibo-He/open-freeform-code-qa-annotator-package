The code you have written for inserting an image is correct. The problem might be with the path of the image you are trying to display. 

```html
<img src="hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>
```
In the `src` attribute, you have given the name of the image file as `hologram.jpg`. This means that the HTML file is looking for this image in the same directory where the HTML file is located. If the image is not in the same directory, you need to provide the correct path to the image file.

Here are some examples:

- If your image is in a subfolder named `images`, the `src` would be `src="images/hologram.jpg"`
- If your image is in the parent directory of your HTML file, the `src` would be `src="../hologram.jpg"`

Also, make sure that the image file name and extension are correct. File names are case-sensitive, so `hologram.jpg` is different from `Hologram.jpg` or `hologram.JPG`.

If the image is hosted online, you can use the direct URL to the image file in the `src` attribute.

```html
<img src="https://example.com/path/to/hologram.jpg" alt="Holograms" width="500" height="500"><br>
```

If none of these solutions work, the problem might be with the image file itself. Try opening it with an image viewer to make sure it's not corrupted.
