The error message indicates that Python is not found in the PATH. Node-gyp, which is a dependency of node-sass, requires Python to be installed. 

There are two ways to solve this:

1. Install Python in your Jenkins environment and add it to the PATH. Node-gyp requires Python 2.7, so make sure to install that version. After installing Python, you can set the PYTHON environment variable to the path of the Python executable.

2. If you want to bypass the Python requirement, you can use a version of node-sass that doesn't require node-gyp. Node-sass v4.14.1 and later provide pre-built binaries for popular platforms, so they don't require node-gyp and Python. You can install it with `npm install node-sass@4.14.1`.

Remember to clean the npm cache with `npm cache clean` before installing the new version of node-sass.
