The EINTEGRITY error is a checksum error that occurs when the package's contents change, but its version number does not. This can happen if a package was published, then unpublished and republished with the same version number but different contents.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Update npm**: Your npm version is quite old. Updating npm might solve the issue. You can update npm using the following command:

    ```
    sudo npm install -g npm
    ```

2. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json**: Delete the `node_modules` directory and `package-lock.json` file in your project directory, then try to install the packages again:

    ```
    rm -rf node_modules
    rm package-lock.json
    sudo npm install
    ```

3. **Clear npm cache**: Clear the npm cache and try to install the packages again:

    ```
    npm cache verify
    sudo npm install
    ```

4. **Use --no-shrinkwrap or --no-package-lock**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try to install the packages with the `--no-shrinkwrap` or `--no-package-lock` option:

    ```
    sudo npm install --no-shrinkwrap
    ```

    or

    ```
    sudo npm install --no-package-lock
    ```

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes.
