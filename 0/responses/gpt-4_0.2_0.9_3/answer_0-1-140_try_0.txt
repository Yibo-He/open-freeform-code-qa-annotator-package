In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons has changed a bit. Now, there are different font families for different styles of icons. For example, "Font Awesome 5 Free" for solid icons, "Font Awesome 5 Brands" for brand icons, and "Font Awesome 5 Regular" for regular icons.

Also, you need to specify the font-weight because Font Awesome 5 uses different font weights. For the free version, the font weights are 400 for regular style, and 900 for solid style.

So, if you want to use a solid icon, you should use:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

And if you want to use a regular icon, you should use:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';
  font-weight: 400;
}
```

Please make sure you have included the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your project.
