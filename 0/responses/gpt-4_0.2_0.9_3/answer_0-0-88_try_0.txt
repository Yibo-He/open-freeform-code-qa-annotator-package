The error you're seeing is likely because you're trying to create an array of a negative length. In JavaScript, the `Array()` constructor creates an array of the specified length. If the length is not a positive integer, a `RangeError` is thrown.

In your code, `props.ingredients[igKey]` is used as the length for the new array. If `props.ingredients[igKey]` is not a positive integer (including zero), it will throw the error you're seeing.

To fix this, you should ensure that `props.ingredients[igKey]` is always a positive integer. You can do this by using the `Math.max()` function, which returns the largest of the zero or more numbers given as input parameters.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
const burger = (props) => {
  let transformedIngredients = Object.keys(props.ingredients).map(igKey => (
    // eslint-disable-next-line max-len,react/no-array-index-key
    [...Array(Math.max(0, props.ingredients[igKey]))].map((_, i) => <BurgerIngredient key={igKey + i} type={igKey} />)
  )).reduce((arr, el) => (
    arr.concat(el)
  ), []);

  if (transformedIngredients.length === 0) {
    transformedIngredients = <p>Please add some ingredients!</p>;
  }
```

In this code, `Math.max(0, props.ingredients[igKey])` ensures that the length of the new array is always zero or a positive integer. If `props.ingredients[igKey]` is negative, `Math.max()` will return `0`, and an empty array will be created.
