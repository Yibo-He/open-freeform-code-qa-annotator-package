The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter. Here's how you can do it:

First, you need to add a custom class to your accordion button. Let's call it `custom-accordion-button`:

```html
<button class="accordion-button custom-accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
    name and surname
</button>
```

Then, in your CSS, you can apply a filter to this class to change the color of the arrow. The `hue-rotate` filter can be used to change the color. The value of `hue-rotate` is an angle, so `120deg` will rotate the color wheel by 120 degrees, which should change the color from the default black to green:

```css
.custom-accordion-button::after {
    filter: hue-rotate(120deg);
}
```

This will change the color of the arrow to green. Note that the exact color will depend on the original color of the arrow and the degree of rotation. You may need to adjust the value to get the exact color you want.

Also, please note that CSS filters are not supported in Internet Explorer.
