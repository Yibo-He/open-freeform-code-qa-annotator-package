In JSON, `undefined` is not a valid value. JSON only allows the following data types: string, number, object, array, boolean, null. 

If you are getting JSON from an API that includes `undefined`, it's not valid JSON. The API should be fixed to not generate `undefined` values. 

If you can't fix the API, you'll have to pre-process the JSON string to replace `undefined` with a valid JSON value, like `null` or a string `"undefined"`. 

Here's an example of how you could do this in JavaScript:

```javascript
let jsonString = '{ "name": undefined}';
jsonString = jsonString.replace(/undefined/g, 'null');
let parsed = JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

In this example, all occurrences of `undefined` are replaced with `null` before parsing the JSON string. 

Please note that this is a workaround and the best solution would be to fix the API to not generate `undefined` values.
