The error message "Unsupported class file major version 57" indicates that the Java version used in your project is not compatible with the one used by Gradle. 

The major version 57 corresponds to Java 13, but in your `build.gradle` file, you have specified Java 8 as the source and target compatibility. 

This mismatch could be the cause of the error. 

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check the Java version used by Gradle. You can do this by running the command `./gradlew -version` in your terminal. This will display the Java version used by Gradle.

2. If the Java version used by Gradle is higher than 8 (which is the version you specified in your `build.gradle` file), you can downgrade it. To do this, you can specify the Java version in your `gradle.properties` file. Add this line to the file: `org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk8`.

3. Alternatively, you can upgrade the source and target compatibility in your `build.gradle` file to match the Java version used by Gradle. However, this might not be the best solution if your project relies on features specific to Java 8.

4. Make sure that the correct Java version is set in your system's `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. You can check this by running `echo $JAVA_HOME` in your terminal.

5. If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Android Studio, make sure that the correct Java SDK is selected in the project structure settings.

Remember to clean and rebuild your project after making these changes.
