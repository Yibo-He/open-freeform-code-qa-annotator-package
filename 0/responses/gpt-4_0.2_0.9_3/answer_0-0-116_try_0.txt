The error message you're seeing indicates that the 'node-sass' module, which is required by Angular, is not installed in your project. 

You can fix this issue by installing the 'node-sass' module. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command.
3. Once you're in the project directory, run the following command to install 'node-sass':

```bash
npm install node-sass
```

This command will install 'node-sass' and add it to your project dependencies. After the installation is complete, try running `ng serve` again. Your project should now compile and run without any issues.

If you still encounter the same error, it might be due to a version compatibility issue between 'node-sass' and Node.js. In this case, you can try installing a different version of 'node-sass' that is compatible with your Node.js version. You can specify the version of 'node-sass' to install like this:

```bash
npm install node-sass@4.14.1
```

Replace '4.14.1' with the version number that is compatible with your Node.js version.
