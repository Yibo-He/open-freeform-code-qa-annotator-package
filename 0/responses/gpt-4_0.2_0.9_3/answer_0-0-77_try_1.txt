Axios does not send cookies by default. You need to set the `withCredentials` option to `true` in the global axios defaults. This will make axios send cookies in all requests.

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

After setting this, axios will automatically include cookies in all requests.

Please note that for CORS requests, the server must also allow credentials. You can do this in your Express.js server by setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header to `true`.

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
  // other headers...
  next();
});
```

Also, make sure that you're setting the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header to the exact origin of the client, not `*`, because the `*` value doesn't work with credentials.

```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', 'http://your-client-origin.com');
  // other headers...
  next();
});
```

Replace `'http://your-client-origin.com'` with the actual origin of your client.
