In Tailwind CSS, you can use the border utilities to add a border to a specific side of an element. You can specify the border color, width, and style.

If you want to add a border only to the top of an element, you can use the `border-t` utility. Here's an example:

```html
<div class="border-t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will add a 1px blue border to the top of the div. If you want to specify a different border width, you can use the `border-t-{n}` utility, where `{n}` is the width of the border in pixels. For example, `border-t-2` will add a 2px border.

If you want to add a border to a different side of the element, you can use the `border-r`, `border-b`, or `border-l` utilities for the right, bottom, and left sides, respectively.

Regarding your question about making the code shorter, unfortunately, there's no built-in way in Tailwind CSS to do this. The border utilities are designed to be explicit and self-explanatory, which means they can sometimes be a bit verbose. However, this verbosity also makes your code easier to understand and maintain.

If you find yourself repeatedly using the same combination of border utilities, you might consider creating a custom CSS class or a Tailwind CSS plugin to encapsulate them. This can help to keep your HTML clean and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).

As for the JIT (Just-In-Time) mode in Tailwind CSS, it allows you to use arbitrary values in your utility classes, which can be useful for creating responsive designs or for working with values that aren't included in your theme configuration. However, it doesn't provide a way to shorten the border utilities.
