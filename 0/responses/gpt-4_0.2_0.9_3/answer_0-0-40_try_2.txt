It seems like you're having trouble with npm not being installed or recognized in your system. You didn't provide the output of `npm -v` or `whereis` command, but I'll assume that they're not showing the expected results.

Here are a few steps you can follow to solve this issue:

1. Uninstall nodejs and npm:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove nodejs
```

2. Update your system:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Reinstall nodejs and npm. The Node.js package is available in the NodeSource repository. You'll need to add it to your system to be able to install the latest Nodejs version.
```bash
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_14.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
```
This will install Node.js and npm from the NodeSource repository which should include the npm.

4. Verify the installation by checking their versions:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you still encounter issues, please provide more details about the error messages you're getting.
