The error message you're seeing is a TypeScript error. TypeScript is complaining because it doesn't know the type of `process.env.APP_ENV`. TypeScript is a statically typed language, which means it needs to know the types of all variables at compile time. 

In this case, `process.env.APP_ENV` is a Node.js environment variable, and TypeScript doesn't know what type it is. 

To fix this error, you need to tell TypeScript what type `process.env.APP_ENV` is. You can do this by declaring a global interface for `process.env` and adding `APP_ENV` as a property. Here's an example:

```typescript
declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    interface ProcessEnv {
      APP_ENV: string;
    }
  }
}
```

This tells TypeScript that `process.env.APP_ENV` is a string. Now you should be able to use `process.env.APP_ENV` without any TypeScript errors.

Remember to place this declaration in a `.d.ts` file (like `typings.d.ts` or `env.d.ts`) in your project, so TypeScript can pick it up during the compilation process. 

Also, make sure that you have set the `APP_ENV` variable in your environment. You can do this in your `.env` file or in your deployment settings, depending on how your project is set up.
