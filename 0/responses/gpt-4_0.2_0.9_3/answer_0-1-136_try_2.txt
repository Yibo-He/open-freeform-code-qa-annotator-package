The issue is that you're using the class "row" in your parent div. This class is commonly used in CSS frameworks like Bootstrap and it applies a flexbox layout, making the children elements arrange in a row (horizontal) instead of a column (vertical). 

If you want to use scroll snapping vertically, you should make sure the children elements are arranged in a column. So, you should remove the "row" class from the parent div, or if you need it for other styling purposes, override the flexbox layout by adding `flex-direction: column;` to your `.parent` class.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  overflow-y: scroll;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

And the HTML:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

This should make your scroll snapping work as expected.
