The CSS you've written seems to be correct for vertical scroll snapping. However, the issue might be that you're missing the CSS property `overflow-y: scroll;` in your `.parent` class. This property is necessary to enable scrolling within the parent element.

Here's the corrected CSS:

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
  overflow-y: scroll;
}

section {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  position: relative;
}

.one {
  background-color: red;
}

.two {
  background-color: blue;
}

.three {
  background-color: grey;
}

.four {
  background-color: green;
}
```

Also, note that `scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);` is not necessary and is not currently supported in any major browsers. The `scroll-snap-type: mandatory;` is also redundant and can be removed, as you've already defined `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;` afterwards.
