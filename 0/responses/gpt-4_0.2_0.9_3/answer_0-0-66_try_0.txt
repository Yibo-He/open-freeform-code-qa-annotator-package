Yes, there is a way to run only one test in Cypress. You can use the `.only` method to specify the test you want to run. 

Here's an example:

```javascript
describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  it.only('My Test Case', () => {
    // Your test code here
  });

  it('Another Test Case', () => {
    // This test will be skipped
  });
});
```

In this example, only the test case 'My Test Case' will be run, and 'Another Test Case' will be skipped. 

Remember to remove the `.only` method after you're done, to ensure all your tests are being run as expected.
