Yes, there is a more concise way to check if a value is not null and not an empty string in JavaScript. You can simply use an if statement with the variable itself like so:

```javascript
var data; //get its value from db 
if(data) {
   // do something
}
```

In JavaScript, `null`, `undefined`, `NaN`, `false`, `0`, `""` (empty string), and `''` (empty string) are all considered "falsy" and will not pass the `if(data)` check. Therefore, this code will only execute if `data` is not null and not an empty string, among other "falsy" values.

However, if you want to specifically check for `null` and empty string (`""`), and allow other "falsy" values like `0` or `false`, your original code is the correct way to do it.
