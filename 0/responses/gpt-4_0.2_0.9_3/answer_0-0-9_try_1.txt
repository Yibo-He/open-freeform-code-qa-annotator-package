The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `req.logout()` function requires a callback function. However, in the Passport.js documentation, it is stated that `req.logout()` function does not require a callback.

This error might be due to a version mismatch or some other issue. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Passport.js installed. You can update it using npm:

```bash
npm update passport
```

2. Try to delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.

3. If the above steps don't work, you can use `req.session.destroy()` instead of `req.logout()`. This will destroy the session, effectively logging the user out:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.session.destroy(function (err) {
        res.redirect("/"); //Inside a callbackâ€¦ bulletproof!
    });
});
```

Remember, `req.session.destroy()` will remove the session data, so use it carefully. If you're storing other data in the session that you need, this might not be the best solution.
