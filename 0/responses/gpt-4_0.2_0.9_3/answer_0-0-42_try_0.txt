The error you're encountering is because the `connect-mongo` package has been updated and the way to use it has changed. In the newer versions (from 4.0.0 and above), you need to use it differently.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: 'mongodb://localhost/test-app' })
}));
```

In the `store` option, we're using `MongoStore.create()` instead of `new MongoStore()`. Also, we're passing `mongoUrl` which is the connection string for your MongoDB. Replace `'mongodb://localhost/test-app'` with your MongoDB connection string.

If you want to use the `mongoose.connection` object, you can do it like this:

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/test-app', { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true });

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ client: mongoose.connection.getClient() })
}));
```

In this case, we're using `mongoose.connection.getClient()` to get the MongoDB client from the Mongoose connection.

Remember to replace `'mongodb://localhost/test-app'` with your MongoDB connection string.
