The `payer` in your code is the account that will pay for the transaction fee. When you are using a wallet, the wallet itself is the payer. You don't need to get the secret key of the wallet, you just need to sign the transaction with the wallet.

Here is how you can do it:

1. Create a `@solana/web3.js` Transaction object and add instructions to it:

```javascript
const transaction = new Transaction().add(
    Token.createTransferInstruction(
        TOKEN_PROGRAM_ID,
        fromTokenAccount.address,
        toTokenAccount.address,
        publicKey,
        [],
        amount
    )
);
```

2. Sign the transaction with the wallet:

```javascript
const { blockhash } = await connection.getRecentBlockhash();
transaction.recentBlockhash = blockhash;
transaction.feePayer = publicKey; // the wallet is the fee payer

// Sign transaction with wallet
let signedTransaction = await wallet.signTransaction(transaction);
```

3. Send the transaction over a Connection:

```javascript
const signature = await connection.sendRawTransaction(signedTransaction.serialize());
```

Please note that the `wallet` object in the code above is the wallet instance you get from the `solana-wallet-adapter`. You can get it from the `useWallet` hook:

```javascript
const { wallet } = useWallet();
```

Also, please make sure to handle the case when the wallet is not connected. You can check if the wallet is connected by checking `wallet.connected`:

```javascript
if (!wallet.connected) {
    throw new WalletNotConnectedError();
}
```

And don't forget to handle the promise rejections for the async functions.
