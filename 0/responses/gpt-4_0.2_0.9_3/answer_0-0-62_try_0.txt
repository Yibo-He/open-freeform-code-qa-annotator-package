The error you're seeing is due to the way you're assigning keys in your `v-for` loop. Vue.js requires that each node in a list have a unique key so it can track each node's identity. This is especially important when you want to reorder or update the list.

In your case, you're using the entire `comment` object as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment">
```

Vue.js recommends using string or number values as keys. If your `comment` object has a unique id, you should use that as the key:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If your `comment` object doesn't have a unique id, and you're sure that the `text` of each comment is unique, you could use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.text">
```

But be careful with this approach. If two comments have the same text, you'll run into issues. It's always best to use a truly unique value as the key.
