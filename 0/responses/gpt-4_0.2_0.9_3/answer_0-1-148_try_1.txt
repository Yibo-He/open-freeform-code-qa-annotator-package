In Tailwind CSS, you can use the `last:` variant to target the last child of a container. However, it doesn't support the `:not()` pseudo-class directly. 

To achieve the desired effect, you can apply the border to all `<li>` elements and then remove it from the last one. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `last:border-b-0` removes the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. 

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your `tailwind.config.js` file for this to work:

```js
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  }
}
```

After adding this configuration, you need to rebuild your project for the changes to take effect.
