You can define an inline type for the objects in your array like this:

```typescript
bagTotal = (products: {name: string, price: number, description: string}[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

This tells TypeScript that `products` is an array of objects, where each object has a `name` property of type `string`, a `price` property of type `number`, and a `description` property of type `string`.

Alternatively, you can define an interface for your product and then use that in your function declaration:

```typescript
interface Product {
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
}

bagTotal = (products: Product[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

This approach is more reusable if you need to use the same type in multiple places.
