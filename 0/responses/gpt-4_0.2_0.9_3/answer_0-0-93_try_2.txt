The issue you're facing is likely due to the mismatch between the structure of the data you're trying to patch and the structure of the data that the `p-multiSelect` component expects.

The `p-multiSelect` component expects an array of objects, where each object has a `label` and a `value` property. However, you're trying to patch an array of numbers.

To solve this issue, you need to convert your array of numbers back to the original structure, i.e., an array of objects. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
let excludeDaysNumbers = [1, 2]; // This should be your converted array of numbers
let patchedExcludeDays = this.excludeDays.filter(day => excludeDaysNumbers.includes(day.value));

this.form.patchValue({
  ... : ....
  excludeDays: patchedExcludeDays
});
```

In this code, `filter` is used to create a new array with all elements that pass the test implemented by the provided function. The `includes` method is used to determine whether an array includes a certain value among its entries.
