The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that you're not actually showing the toast. The `$('.toast').toast(option)` line is just initializing the toast. To show it, you need to call `$('.toast').toast('show')`.

Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.toast').toast({ autohide: false });
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This code will initialize the toast and then show it when the document is ready. The `{ autohide: false }` option is used to keep the toast visible until the user dismisses it.

Also, make sure that your toast is not hidden by CSS. If it's still not showing, try adding this CSS rule to make sure it's visible:

```css
.toast {
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
}
```

This will position the toast at the top right corner of the page. You can adjust the position according to your needs.

If you want the toast to autohide after a certain amount of time, you can set the `autohide` option to `true` and use the `delay` option to specify the delay in milliseconds:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.toast').toast({ autohide: true, delay: 5000 });
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This will hide the toast automatically after 5 seconds.
