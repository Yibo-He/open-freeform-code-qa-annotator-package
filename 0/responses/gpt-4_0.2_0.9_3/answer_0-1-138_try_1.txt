Yes, you can detect if a user's system is in dark mode using CSS media queries. The `prefers-color-scheme` media feature is used to detect if the user has requested the system use a light or dark color theme.

Here's an example:

```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* CSS for dark mode */
  body {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
  }
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: light) {
  /* CSS for light mode */
  body {
    background-color: white;
    color: black;
  }
}
```

In this example, the browser will apply the dark mode styles if the user's system is set to dark mode, and the light mode styles if it's set to light mode.

You can also use JavaScript to detect the user's preferred color scheme:

```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
    // dark mode is enabled
}
```

This feature is supported in Safari 12.1, Firefox 67, and Chrome 76 and later versions.
