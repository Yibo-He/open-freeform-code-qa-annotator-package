The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the `else` statement in your code is not actually handling the case where the user denies the location permission. The `if (navigator.geolocation)` check is only verifying if the geolocation API is available in the user's browser, not whether the user has granted or denied permission.

The `getCurrentPosition` method takes a second argument which is an error handling function. This function will be called if the user denies the location permission. Here's how you can modify your code to handle this:

```javascript
ngOnInit() {
   this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
   if (navigator.geolocation) {
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
        position => {
            this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
            this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
        },
        error => {
            // This will be called if the user denies location permission
            console.log("User not allow");
        }
    );
   } else {
       console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
   }
}
```

In this code, if the user denies the location permission, the error handling function will be called and "User not allow" will be logged to the console.
