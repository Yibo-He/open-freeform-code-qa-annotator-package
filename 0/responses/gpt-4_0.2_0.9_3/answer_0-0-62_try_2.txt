The error message is telling you that you're using a non-primitive value (in this case, an object) as a key in your `v-for` loop. Vue uses the `key` attribute to track each node's identity, so it can reuse and reorder existing elements for efficiency. When you use an object as a key, Vue can't track the nodes properly, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

In your case, `comment` is likely an object, which is why you're seeing this error. To fix it, you should use a unique primitive value (like a string or a number) from each `comment` as the key. If each comment has a unique id, you could use that:

```html
<div v-for="comment in comments" :key="comment.id">
```

If there's no unique id, you could use the index of the loop:

```html
<div v-for="(comment, index) in comments" :key="index">
```

Just remember that using the index as a key is a last resort, as it can lead to issues if the order of items changes. It's always better to use a unique identifier from your data if possible.
