Webpack 5 removed some node.js polyfills, including `fs` and `net`. This is why you're seeing the error. The `node` configuration option no longer accepts these properties.

To fix this, you need to install the polyfills manually. Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the required packages:

```bash
npm install --save stream-browserify assert browserify-zlib constants-browserify crypto-browserify events process path-browserify os-browserify
```

2. Then, update your webpack configuration file to include the following:

```javascript
const webpack = require('webpack');
const path = require('path');

module.exports = {
  // ...
  resolve: {
    fallback: {
      "stream": require.resolve("stream-browserify"),
      "assert": require.resolve("assert"),
      "zlib": require.resolve("browserify-zlib"),
      "constants": require.resolve("constants-browserify"),
      "crypto": require.resolve("crypto-browserify"),
      "events": require.resolve("events"),
      "process": require.resolve("process/browser"),
      "path": require.resolve("path-browserify"),
      "os": require.resolve("os-browserify/browser"),
    }
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.ProvidePlugin({
      process: 'process/browser',
    }),
  ],
  // ...
};
```

This configuration will tell webpack to use the browser versions of the node.js modules when it encounters them. 

Please note that the `fs` and `net` modules are not fully browser-compatible, and you may encounter issues if your code or any dependencies are trying to use node.js-specific features that aren't available in the browser. If you're using a library that's trying to use these modules, you may need to find a browser-compatible alternative.
