It seems like you accidentally left out the method or technology you want to use to select these elements. However, I'll provide solutions for both JavaScript and jQuery:

1. JavaScript:
```javascript
let children = document.querySelector('.section').children;
```
This will give you a HTMLCollection of direct children of the div with class "section".

2. jQuery:
```javascript
let children = $('.section').children();
```
This will give you a jQuery object containing all direct children of the div with class "section".

Remember, both of these methods will give you all direct children, not just divs. If you want to select only divs, you can modify the selectors like this:

JavaScript:
```javascript
let divChildren = document.querySelectorAll('.section > div');
```

jQuery:
```javascript
let divChildren = $('.section > div');
```
