You can use the `space-y-*` utility classes from Tailwind CSS to add space between your elements, which will also add a border between them. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul class="space-y-1">
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `space-y-1` adds a 0.25rem space between each `<li>`. The border will appear in this space, effectively creating a border between each item, but not after the last one.

If you want to use the `:not(:last-child)` pseudo-class, you would need to write custom CSS because Tailwind does not support this pseudo-class directly. Here's how you can do it:

```css
li:not(:last-child) {
  @apply border-solid border-b border-black;
}
```

Then, you can use this class in your HTML:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="not-last-border"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

This will apply the border to all `<li>` elements except the last one.
