To connect to Heroku Redis using TLS on Node, you should use the `REDIS_TLS_URL` environment variable. This URL includes the necessary information for connecting via TLS, including the hostname, port, and credentials.

Here is a basic example of how you can connect to Heroku Redis using TLS in Node.js with the `node_redis` library:

```javascript
const redis = require('redis');
const url = require('url');

let redisURL = url.parse(process.env.REDIS_TLS_URL);
let client = redis.createClient({
    port: redisURL.port,
    host: redisURL.hostname,
    password: redisURL.auth.split(":")[1],
    tls: {
        rejectUnauthorized: false
    }
});

client.on('connect', function() {
    console.log('Connected to Redis');
});

client.on('error', function (err) {
    console.log('Redis error: ' + err);
});
```

In this example, the `REDIS_TLS_URL` is parsed to extract the host, port, and password. The `tls` option is set to an object with `rejectUnauthorized: false` to allow connections to the server even if the SSL certificate is not trusted.

Please note that setting `rejectUnauthorized: false` can leave you vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. In a production environment, you should use a trusted certificate and set `rejectUnauthorized: true`.

Also, remember to replace `process.env.REDIS_TLS_URL` with your actual Redis TLS URL.
