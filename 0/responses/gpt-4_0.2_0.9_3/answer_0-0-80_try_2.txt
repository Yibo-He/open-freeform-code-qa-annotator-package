The `disabled` attribute is a boolean attribute. When this attribute is present, no matter the value, the element is disabled. This is why your select is always disabled.

In Angular, you can conditionally add attributes by binding to `null`. If the expression you bind to `null` evaluates to `true`, the attribute will not be added. If the expression evaluates to `false`, the attribute will be added.

So, you should change your code to:

```html
<select [attr.disabled]="editable ? null : ''">
...
</select>
```

This way, when `editable` is `true`, `disabled` attribute will not be added and when `editable` is `false`, `disabled` attribute will be added.
