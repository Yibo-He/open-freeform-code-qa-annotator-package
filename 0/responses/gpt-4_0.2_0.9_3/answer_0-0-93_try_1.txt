The problem you're facing is likely due to the fact that you're trying to patch the form with an array of numbers, while your `p-multiSelect` component is expecting an array of objects (each with a `label` and `value` property).

You need to convert your array of numbers back into the appropriate object format before patching the form. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
let excludeDaysNumbers = [1, 2]; // This should be your converted array of numbers

let excludeDaysObjects = this.excludeDays.filter(day => excludeDaysNumbers.includes(day.value));

this.form.patchValue({
  ... : ....
  excludeDays: excludeDaysObjects
});
```

In this code, `excludeDaysObjects` will be an array of objects from `this.excludeDays` where the `value` property is included in your `excludeDaysNumbers` array. This array can then be used to patch your form.

Remember, `p-multiSelect` component expects an array of objects (with `label` and `value` properties) to pre-select options, not just an array of numbers.
