The error message you're seeing is related to the Android Gradle build failing. This can happen for a variety of reasons, but in your case, it's likely related to the `react-native link` command.

The `react-native link` command is used to automatically link native dependencies in your project. However, from React Native 0.60 and above, auto-linking is supported so you don't need to use `react-native link`. But as I see, you are using React Native version 0.58.3 which doesn't support auto-linking.

Here are a few steps you can take to try and resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, the build files can get into a bad state causing issues. You can clean your project and rebuild it. Navigate to your android folder in your react native project and run the following commands:

```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..
react-native run-android
```

2. **Manual Linking**: If the `react-native link` command is not working properly, you can try to link the library manually. Here are the general steps to do that for `react-native-gesture-handler`:

- Update `android/settings.gradle` to include the `react-native-gesture-handler` package:

```gradle
include ':react-native-gesture-handler'
project(':react-native-gesture-handler').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/react-native-gesture-handler/android')
```

- Update `android/app/build.gradle` to add `react-native-gesture-handler` as a dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
   ...
   implementation project(':react-native-gesture-handler')
}
```

- Update `MainApplication.java` to use `react-native-gesture-handler`:

```java
import com.swmansion.gesturehandler.react.RNGestureHandlerPackage;  // <-- add this import

public class MainApplication extends Application implements ReactApplication {
    //...
    @Override
    protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
      return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
          new MainReactPackage(),
            new RNGestureHandlerPackage()  // <-- add this line
      );
    }
}
```

After these changes, try to run your project again.

3. **Upgrade React Native**: As I mentioned earlier, React Native 0.60 and above support auto-linking. So, you might consider upgrading your React Native version to the latest one. But remember, upgrading might also require you to make other changes in your project to ensure compatibility.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about the error message you're seeing. The screenshot you mentioned was not attached, so I can't see the exact error message.
