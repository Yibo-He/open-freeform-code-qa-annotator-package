You can downgrade `npm` to a specific version using the same command you used to upgrade it, but instead of `@latest`, you specify the version number you want. 

Here's the general format of the command:

```bash
npm install -g npm@version
```

Replace `version` with the version number you want to downgrade to. For example, if you want to downgrade to version 6.14.8, you would run:

```bash
npm install -g npm@6.14.8
```

This will install that specific version of `npm` globally on your system. 

You can confirm the version of `npm` that is currently active by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

This should return the version number you specified in the install command.
