The issue seems to be with how you're importing the `AuthContext` in your `RegisterRoutes` component. You're trying to import it as a default export, but it's not being exported as default from `authContext.js`.

In `authContext.js`, you're exporting `AuthContext` as a named export:

```javascript
export { AuthContext };
```

So, in `RegisterRoutes.js`, you should import it like this:

```javascript
import { AuthContext } from "../context/authContext";
```

Instead of:

```javascript
import AuthContext from "../context/authContext";
```

This should solve the issue of `isAuthenticated` being `undefined`.
