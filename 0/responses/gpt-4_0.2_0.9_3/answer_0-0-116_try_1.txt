The error message you're seeing indicates that the 'node-sass' module, which is required by Angular, is not installed in your project.

You can fix this issue by installing 'node-sass' using npm (Node Package Manager). Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to your project directory using the `cd` command. For example, if your project is in a folder named 'my-angular-app' on your desktop, you would use the command `cd Desktop/my-angular-app`.
3. Once you're in your project directory, install 'node-sass' by running the following command: `npm install node-sass`.

After the installation is complete, try running `ng serve` again. The error should be resolved and your Angular application should start as expected.

If you still encounter the error, it might be due to version compatibility issues. In that case, you might need to install a specific version of 'node-sass' that is compatible with your project. You can do this by specifying the version number in the install command, like so: `npm install node-sass@4.14.1`. Replace '4.14.1' with the version number that is compatible with your project.
