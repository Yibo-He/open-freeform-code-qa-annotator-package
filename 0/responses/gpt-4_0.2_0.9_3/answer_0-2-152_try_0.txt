The Bootstrap toast component is hidden by default and needs to be shown using JavaScript. The `$('.toast').toast(option)` line you have in your JavaScript file is correct, but you need to replace `option` with `'show'` to actually display the toast.

Here's how you should modify your JavaScript:

```javascript
$(document).ready(function(){
    $('.toast').toast('show');
});
```

This code waits until the document is fully loaded, then shows the toast.

Also, make sure that your JavaScript file is correctly linked in your HTML file and that it's loaded after jQuery and Bootstrap's JavaScript files. If it's loaded before, the `$` and `.toast` functions won't be recognized.

If you're still having trouble, check your browser's console for any error messages. These can give you clues about what's going wrong.
