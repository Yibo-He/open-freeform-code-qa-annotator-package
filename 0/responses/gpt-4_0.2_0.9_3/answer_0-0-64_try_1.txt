The error message is indicating that there are incompatible peer dependencies. This means that some of the packages you're trying to update have dependencies on other packages, and the versions of those packages that would be installed by the update are not compatible with the versions required by the packages you're updating.

Here's how you can resolve this:

1. Update `rxjs` to version 6. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save rxjs@6
```

2. Angular 6 requires TypeScript version 2.7.x. However, your current version is 2.6.2. You can update TypeScript by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save-dev typescript@2.7.2
```

3. The `@angular/flex-layout` package has a peer dependency on `rxjs` version 5.5.0. However, Angular 6 uses `rxjs` version 6. You need to update `@angular/flex-layout` to a version that is compatible with `rxjs` version 6. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm install --save @angular/flex-layout@6.0.0-beta.15
```

After running these commands, try running the `ng update @angular/core` command again. It should now run without any errors.
