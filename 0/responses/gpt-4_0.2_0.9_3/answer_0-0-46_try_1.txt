The error message you're seeing is from ESLint, which is a tool for identifying and reporting on patterns found in ECMAScript/JavaScript code. It's complaining that it can't read the `tsconfig.json` file.

In your `.eslintrc.js` file, you have specified the `project` option in `parserOptions` as `tsconfig.json`. This is a relative path, and ESLint will look for this file in the same directory as the `.eslintrc.js` file.

If your `tsconfig.json` file is not in the same directory as your `.eslintrc.js` file, you will need to provide the correct relative path. For example, if your `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory of your project and your `.eslintrc.js` file is in a subdirectory, you would need to change the `project` option to `../tsconfig.json`.

Here is the updated `.eslintrc.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  env: {
    browser: true,
    es6: true,
    node: true,
  },
  extends: [
    "plugin:import/errors",
    "plugin:import/warnings",
    "plugin:import/typescript",
  ],
  parser: "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  parserOptions: {
    project: "../tsconfig.json", // Update this path to the correct relative path
    sourceType: "module",
  },
  plugins: [
    "@typescript-eslint",
    "import",
  ],
  // ... rest of your configuration
};
```

If the `tsconfig.json` file is in the root directory and the `.eslintrc.js` file is in the `src` directory, you would use `../tsconfig.json`. If they are both in the root directory, you would use `./tsconfig.json`.

After updating the path, you should restart your editor or the ESLint server for the changes to take effect. If you're still having issues, please let me know.
