The error message is not provided in your question, but I'm assuming you're having issues with importing jQuery and Bootstrap in your React project. 

Here's how you can import Bootstrap and jQuery in your React project:

1. First, install jQuery, Bootstrap and Popper.js (required for Bootstrap) using npm:

```bash
npm install jquery popper.js bootstrap
```

2. Then, import them in your `index.js` file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import './index.css';
import 'jquery/dist/jquery.min.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.min.js';
```

This should work, but if you're still having issues, please provide the error message so I can give a more accurate solution.
