The arrow in the Bootstrap accordion is actually a background image. You can change its color by applying a CSS filter to it. 

Here is how you can do it:

```css
.accordion-button::after {
    /* You may need to adjust the filter value to get the exact color you want */
    filter: invert(48%) sepia(99%) saturate(1362%) hue-rotate(106deg) brightness(96%) contrast(91%);
}
```

This CSS rule targets the `::after` pseudo-element of the `.accordion-button` class, which is where the arrow image is located. The `filter` property is used to apply graphical effects like blurring or color shifting to an element. Filters are commonly used to adjust the rendering of images, backgrounds, and borders.

In this case, we're using a combination of different filter functions to change the color of the arrow. You may need to adjust the values to get the exact color you want.

Add this CSS to your stylesheet or in a `<style>` tag in your HTML file.
