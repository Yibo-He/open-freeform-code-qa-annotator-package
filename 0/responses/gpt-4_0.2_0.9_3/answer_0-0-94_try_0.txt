The issue with your code is that `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` do not accept an array as an argument. They expect individual numbers as arguments. You can use the spread operator (`...`) to pass elements of an array as arguments to a function. Here is the corrected code:

```javascript
function getMinMax(arr){
  let maximum = Math.max(...arr);
  let minimum = Math.min(...arr);
  let result =  [maximum, minimum]; 
  return result;
};

console.log(getMinMax([10,3,8,1,33])); // it will log: [33, 1]
```

In this code, `...arr` spreads out the array into individual elements, so it's as if you're calling `Math.max(10, 3, 8, 1, 33)` and `Math.min(10, 3, 8, 1, 33)`, which is the correct usage of these functions.
