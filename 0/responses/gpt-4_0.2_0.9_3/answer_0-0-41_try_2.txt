The problem is that the `else` block in your code is not for handling the case when the user denies the permission for geolocation. It is for the case when the geolocation feature is not available in the user's browser at all.

The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` method takes a second argument which is a function that will be called when an error occurs. This is where you should handle the case when the user denies the permission.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```javascript
ngOnInit() {
    this.getUserLocation();
}

getUserLocation() {
    if (navigator.geolocation) {
        navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(
            position => {
                this.lat = position.coords.latitude;
                this.lng = position.coords.longitude;
            },
            error => {
                if (error.code === error.PERMISSION_DENIED)
                    console.log("User denied the request for Geolocation.");
            }
        );
    } else {
        console.log("Geolocation is not supported by this browser.");
    }
}
```

In the above code, if the user denies the permission for geolocation, the error function will be called and "User denied the request for Geolocation." will be logged to the console.
