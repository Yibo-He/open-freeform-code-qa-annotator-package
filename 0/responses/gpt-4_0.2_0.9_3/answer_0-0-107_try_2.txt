The error message you're seeing is due to the default execution policy in PowerShell, which is Restricted. This means no scripts are allowed to run, including your `expo.ps1` script.

To solve this issue, you need to change the execution policy in PowerShell. Here's how to do it:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator. You can do this by searching for PowerShell in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as administrator".

2. Once you have the PowerShell window open, type the following command and press Enter:

```bash
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

This command sets the policy to RemoteSigned, which means that as long as a script is signed by a trusted publisher, it will run.

3. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.

4. After the command completes, close the PowerShell window.

5. Now, try running your `expo --version` command again in the Visual Studio Code terminal. It should work without any issues.

Remember that changing the execution policy can have security implications, so only do this if you understand the risks and trust the scripts you're running.
