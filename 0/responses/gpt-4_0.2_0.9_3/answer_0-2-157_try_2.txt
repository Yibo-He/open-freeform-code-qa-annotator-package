The warning you're seeing is due to a change in how `::v-deep` is used in Vue 3. It's no longer used as a combinator, but as a function. 

Your current usage:
```css
.parent ::v-deep .child {
   ...
}
```

Should be updated to:
```css
.parent ::v-deep(.child) {
   ...
}
```

In this updated usage, `.child` is the inner selector and is passed as an argument to the `::v-deep` function. This should resolve the warning you're seeing.
