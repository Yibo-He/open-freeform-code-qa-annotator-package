The warning you're seeing is because Vue 3 requires you to explicitly define the custom events a component can emit. This is a new feature in Vue 3 that helps to make the component's API more clear.

In your child component, you're emitting an event called "updatedcount", but you haven't declared it in your component's definition. 

You can fix this by adding an `emits` option to your component definition, like this:

```javascript
export default {
  name: "HelloWorld",
  emits: ['updatedcount'], // Add this line
  setup(_,{ emit }) {
    const store = useStore();

    const fired = () => {
      store.count++;
      emit("updatedcount", store.count);
    };

    return {
      store,
      fired
    };
  },
};
```

The `emits` option is an array that lists the names of the events that this component can emit. Now Vue knows that "updatedcount" is a custom event, and the warning should disappear.
