The issue you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are some possible solutions:

1. **Network Error**: Check if your device/emulator has access to the internet and can reach the server at 'https://48p1r2roz4.sse.codesandbox.io'. You can test this by trying to fetch data from the server using a different method (like `fetch` or `axios`).

2. **CORS Issue**: If your server is not configured to allow requests from your client's origin, it will result in a network error. You can check this in your server's network logs. If this is the case, you need to configure your server to allow requests from your client's origin.

3. **Server Error**: There might be an issue with the server you're trying to fetch data from. Check the server logs for any errors.

4. **Apollo Client Configuration**: There might be an issue with how you've configured Apollo Client. Try using a different URI to see if that resolves the issue.

5. **React Native Debugger**: If you're using React Native Debugger, there might be an issue with how it handles network requests. Try disabling it to see if that resolves the issue.

6. **React Native Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of React Native you're using and Apollo Client. Try updating React Native to the latest version.

7. **Apollo Client Version**: There might be compatibility issues with the version of Apollo Client you're using and React Native. Try updating Apollo Client to the latest version.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider posting this issue on the Apollo Client GitHub page. The maintainers and community there might be able to provide more insight into what's causing this issue.
