The error message is not provided in your question, but I assume you might be getting an error because you're trying to use jQuery and Bootstrap in a React project. React and jQuery don't typically work well together because they both try to manage the DOM, which can lead to unexpected results.

However, if you still want to use Bootstrap and jQuery in your React project, you can do it like this:

First, install jQuery and Bootstrap via npm:

```
npm install jquery
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, in your index.js file:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import './index.css';

import $ from 'jquery';
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

This way, you're importing jQuery, Popper.js (which is a dependency of Bootstrap's JavaScript), and Bootstrap's JavaScript files into your project.

Remember, it's generally recommended to use React-based solutions like React-Bootstrap or reactstrap, instead of jQuery and Bootstrap, in a React project.
