In Tailwind CSS, you can create responsive components by using the `@apply` directive in combination with the responsive variants. However, you can't directly use `@apply` with responsive variants. You'll need to create a new class and then use that class in your HTML.

Here's an example:

```css
/* tailwind.config.js */
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    screens: {
      'sm': '640px',
      'md': '768px',
      'lg': '1024px',
      'xl': '1280px',
      '2xl': '1536px',
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

```css
/* styles.css */
@layer components {
  .tablet-portrait {
    @apply block;
  }
  @screen md {
    .tablet-portrait {
      @apply hidden;
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `.tablet-portrait` class will apply `display: block;` by default, and `display: none;` on medium screens and above.

You can then use this class in your HTML:

```html
<div class="tablet-portrait">This will be hidden on medium screens and above.</div>
```

This is how you can abstract breakpoints as components in Tailwind CSS. It's a bit different from how you would do it in SCSS, but it's just as powerful and flexible.
