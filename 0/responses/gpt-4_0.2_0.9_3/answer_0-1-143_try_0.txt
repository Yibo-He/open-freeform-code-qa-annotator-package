Yes, you can modify the userChrome.css file to customize the appearance of Firefox. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open Firefox and type `about:support` in the address bar and press Enter.
2. In the 'Application Basics' section, click on 'Open Directory' next to 'Profile Directory'.
3. In the opened directory, create a new folder and name it 'chrome'.
4. Inside the 'chrome' folder, create a new file named 'userChrome.css'. (Make sure the file extension is .css)
5. Open the 'userChrome.css' file with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Menu Spacing in Firefox Proton */
:root {
  --proton-density-compact: 4px !important;
  --proton-density-normal: 4px !important;
  --proton-density-touch: 4px !important;
  --proton-menu-horizontal-padding: 4px !important;
  --proton-menu-vertical-padding: 4px !important;
}
```

6. Save the file and close it.
7. Now, you need to enable the usage of this file in Firefox. Type `about:config` in the Firefox address bar and press Enter.
8. Click on 'Accept the Risk and Continue'.
9. In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to true by clicking on the arrow button.
10. Restart Firefox to see the changes.

The values `4px` in the CSS code above are the spacing values. You can adjust them according to your preference. The smaller the value, the less the spacing.
