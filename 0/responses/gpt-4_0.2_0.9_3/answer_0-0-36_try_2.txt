You can use the `window.location.reload()` function to reload the current page. This function will reload the current page, and it will trigger a client-side rendering. Here is how you can use it:

```javascript
window.location.reload();
```

However, please note that this function will completely reload the page, including all scripts, stylesheets, images, etc. This might not be the most efficient way to update your page if you only need to update a small part of it.

If you only need to update a part of your page, you might want to consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX, or the built-in state management features of React (like `useState` and `useContext`). These tools allow you to update specific parts of your page without needing to reload the entire page.
