1) To move the stop button at the top to properly align with the begin button, you can use the `top` property in CSS. Replace `down: 10px;` with `top: 10px;` in your `#StopBtn` CSS rule.

2) To slightly move the bottom arrows up so they would display properly, you can use the `margin-bottom` property in CSS. Add `margin-bottom: 20px;` (or any other value that suits your needs) to your `#controls` CSS rule.

3) To add color on the text "Points Earned" and "Click to start the game", you can use the `color` property in CSS. Add a new CSS rule for `.Status` and `.Points` and set the `color` property to your desired color.

Here are the changes:

```css
#StopBtn{
    position: fixed;
    left: 500px;
    top: 10px; /* changed from down: 10px; */
    border-radius: 4px;
    border: medium solid #000000;
    background-color:rgb(92, 250, 246);
    font-family: "Arial", Impact, Charcoal, sans-serif;
    font-weight: bold;
    font-size:20px;
    color: #ffffff;
    text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px black;
    padding: 5px 30px;
    margin:8px 70px;
}

#controls {
    padding-left: 350px;
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* added this line */
}

.Status, .Points {
    color: #ff0000; /* change to your desired color */
}
```
