The use of Jest and Cypress together is not uncommon, especially in larger projects where different types of testing are required. Jest is often used for unit testing and Cypress for end-to-end testing. This combination allows for comprehensive testing coverage.

However, it's important to note that the choice of testing tools often depends on the specific needs and preferences of the development team. Some teams might prefer to use a single tool to keep their testing environment simpler, while others might prefer to use multiple tools to take advantage of the unique features each tool offers.

In your case, using Cypress for both end-to-end and component testing seems like a good compromise. This approach allows you to maintain consistency in your testing environment while still being able to test different aspects of your application.

Remember, the goal of testing is to ensure the quality and reliability of your application. The tools you use to achieve this goal can vary, and there's no one-size-fits-all solution. It's always a good idea to evaluate different tools and choose the ones that best fit your project's needs.
