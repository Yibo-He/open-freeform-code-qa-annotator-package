You can install a specific version of `npm` using the `npm install -g npm@version` command. Replace `version` with the version number you want to install. 

For example, if you want to install `npm` version 6.14.8, you would run:

```bash
npm install -g npm@6.14.8
```

This will install `npm` version 6.14.8 globally on your system. 

You can verify the installed version of `npm` by running:

```bash
npm -v
```

This will print the version of `npm` that is currently active on your system.
