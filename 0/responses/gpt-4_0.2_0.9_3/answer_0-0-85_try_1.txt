Yes, you can set the primary and secondary colors in your theme.js or theme.ts file in a similar way to how you've done it with Material UI. Here's how you can do it:

If you're using JavaScript:

```javascript
export const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "#7bb9e8",
    secondary: "#eb7f7f",
  },
};
```

If you're using TypeScript:

```typescript
interface Theme {
  colors: {
    primary: string;
    secondary: string;
  };
}

export const theme: Theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: "#7bb9e8",
    secondary: "#eb7f7f",
  },
};
```

Then, you can use these colors in your components like this:

```javascript
import { theme } from './theme';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div style={{ color: theme.colors.primary, backgroundColor: theme.colors.secondary }}>
      Hello, world!
    </div>
  );
}
```

Please note that this is a very basic example. Depending on your project setup and requirements, you might want to use a more sophisticated theming solution, such as styled-components' `ThemeProvider` or Emotion's `ThemeProvider`.
