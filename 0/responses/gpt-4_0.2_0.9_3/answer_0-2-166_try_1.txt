It seems like you accidentally left out the technology or language you want to use to select these elements. However, I'll provide solutions for both JavaScript and jQuery.

In JavaScript, you can use the `children` property or `querySelector` method:

```javascript
let section = document.querySelector('.section');
let children = section.children;
```

Or:

```javascript
let children = document.querySelectorAll('.section > div');
```

In jQuery, you can use the `children` method:

```javascript
let children = $('.section').children('div');
```

These will give you the direct child `div` elements of the `div` with class "section".
