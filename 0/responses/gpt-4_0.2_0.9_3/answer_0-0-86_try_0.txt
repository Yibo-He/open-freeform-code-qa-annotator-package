The error you're encountering is due to the way you're trying to import the icons. The import paths you're using are outdated. 

React Icons has updated their import paths in version 3.0.0 and onwards. You should import icons like this:

```javascript
import { MdTerrain } from "react-icons/md";
import { TiSnowflake } from "react-icons/ti";
import { FaCalendar } from "react-icons/fa";
```

Please note that the icon names are in PascalCase (each word capitalized), not camelCase. So, it's `MdTerrain` not `Terrain`, `TiSnowflake` not `SnowFlake`, and `FaCalendar` not `Calender`.

Also, make sure the spelling is correct. It's `Calendar`, not `Calender`. 

If you still encounter issues, try deleting your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, then run `npm install` again.
