In Tailwind CSS, you can use the `last:` variant to target the last child of a container. However, the `:not()` pseudo-class is not directly supported. 

To achieve the effect of `:not(:last-child)`, you can apply the border to all elements and then remove it from the last one. Here's how you can do it:

```html
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black last:border-b-0"
    >
      Item
    </li>
</ul>
```

In this example, `border-b` applies a bottom border to all `<li>` elements, and `last:border-b-0` removes the bottom border from the last `<li>` element. 

Please note that you need to enable the `last` variant in your tailwind.config.js file if it's not already enabled:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: ['last'],
    }
  },
  // ...
}
```

This will allow you to use the `last:` variant with the `borderWidth` utility.
