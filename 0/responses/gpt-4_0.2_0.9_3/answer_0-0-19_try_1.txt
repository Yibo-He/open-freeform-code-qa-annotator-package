The error message `npm http fetch GET 404 https://registry.npmjs.org/aws-sdk-js 2211ms` suggests that npm is trying to fetch the package `aws-sdk-js` from the npm registry but it's not found, hence the 404 error.

The correct package name for the AWS SDK in the npm registry is `aws-sdk`, not `aws-sdk-js`. 

You should replace `aws-sdk-js` with `aws-sdk` in your `package.json` file or in the npm install command. 

So, the correct command should be:

```bash
npm install --verbose aws-sdk
```

And if you're adding it to your `package.json` file, it should look something like this:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "aws-sdk": "^2.789.0"
}
```

Remember to replace `^2.789.0` with the version you want to use.
