In Tailwind CSS, you can apply a border to a specific side of an element by using the border-width utilities. The border-width utilities control the width of an element's border.

For example, if you want to apply a border to the top side of an element, you can use the `border-t` utility. If you want to apply a border to the right side of an element, you can use the `border-r` utility. Similarly, you can use the `border-b` and `border-l` utilities to apply a border to the bottom and left sides of an element, respectively.

However, if you want to apply a border to only one side of an element and you find the class string too long, you can create a custom utility class in your Tailwind CSS configuration file.

Here's an example of how you can create a custom utility class for a top border:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      borderWidth: {
        '1t': '1px 0 0 0',
      },
      borderColor: theme => ({
        ...theme('colors'),
         'blue-900': '#2c3e50',
      }),
    },
  },
  variants: {},
  plugins: [],
}
```

Then, you can use this custom utility class in your HTML like this:

```html
<div class="border-1t border-blue-900">foo</div>
```

This will apply a 1px border to the top side of the element and color it with the color `blue-900`.

As for your question about JIT, you can use the `@apply` directive to create a new utility class that applies a set of existing utility classes. However, this feature is currently experimental and may not work as expected in all situations.
