The error you're encountering is because the import paths you're using are incorrect. The import paths have changed in the newer versions of `react-icons`.

In the version 3.0.0 and above, the import path should be like this:

```jsx
import { MdTerrain } from "react-icons/md";
import { TiSnowflake } from "react-icons/ti";
import { FaCalendar } from "react-icons/fa";
```

Please note that the icon names are in PascalCase (first letter of each word is capitalized) and the import path is directly from `"react-icons/<library>"`.

If you still encounter issues, please ensure you have the correct version of `react-icons` installed. You can check this by running `npm list react-icons`. If you're not on a version 3.0.0 or above, you may need to update your package. You can do this by running `npm install react-icons@latest`.
