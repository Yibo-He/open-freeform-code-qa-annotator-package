The command `npm install -g @vue/cli` is used to install Vue CLI globally, not to upgrade the Vue.js version in your project. The Vue CLI is a full system for rapid Vue.js development, and its version is different from the Vue.js version.

If you want to upgrade the Vue.js version in your project, you need to update the version in your `package.json` file and then run `npm install` to install the new version. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your `package.json` file.
2. Find the line that starts with `"vue":`.
3. Change the version number to the version you want to upgrade to. For example, if you want to upgrade to version 2.6.12, it should look like this: `"vue": "^2.6.12",`.
4. Save the `package.json` file.
5. Run `npm install` in your terminal.

This will install the new version of Vue.js in your project.

Please note that upgrading Vue.js version might break your application if there are breaking changes between the versions. Always make sure to test your application thoroughly after upgrading.
