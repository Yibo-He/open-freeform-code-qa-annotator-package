PrimeNG uses the CSS variables for its theming which are defined in the theme.css file. However, if changing the `--primary-color` variable doesn't help, it's likely because the color is hardcoded in the CSS file.

Here's a workaround:

1. Create a new CSS file in your project (e.g., `custom-theme.css`).
2. In this file, override the color variables that PrimeNG uses. For example:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #yourColor;
    --primary-color-dark: #yourDarkerColor;
    --primary-color-light: #yourLighterColor;
    --primary-color-text: #yourContrastTextColor;
}
```

3. Import this file in your `styles.css` or `angular.json` file.

```css
@import 'custom-theme.css';
```

This should override the default colors of the theme. If you want to change the color for a specific component, you can do so by overriding the CSS for that component in your `custom-theme.css` file.

Remember that the color shades for hover and focus states are usually generated by darkening or lightening the primary color. You can use a color generator tool to get the darker and lighter shades of your primary color.

If this doesn't work, it might be because the styles are encapsulated and the view encapsulation needs to be set to `None` in the component where you want to apply the styles.

```typescript
import {ViewEncapsulation} from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  ...
  encapsulation: ViewEncapsulation.None
})
```

This will make your styles global and they will affect other components as well. So, use this option carefully.
