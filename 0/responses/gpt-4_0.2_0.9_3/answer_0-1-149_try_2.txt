I've looked at your code and the video you provided. Here's how you can achieve the desired effect using Tailwind CSS:

First, you need to add a `span` element inside your `a` element. This `span` will serve as the underline for your link. You will animate this underline when the link is hovered.

Here's the modified HTML:

```html
<a href="#" class="relative block">
  Hover me
  <span class="absolute h-1 bg-black bottom-0 left-0 w-0 group-hover:w-full transition-all duration-200"></span>
</a>
```

In the above code, the `span` is positioned absolutely at the bottom of the `a` element. It has a height of 1 and a width of 0. When the `a` element is hovered, the width of the `span` is set to `full`, creating the underline effect.

Next, you need to add some CSS to your `a` element to create the group hover effect. You can do this by adding the `group` class to your `a` element:

```html
<a href="#" class="relative block group">
  Hover me
  <span class="absolute h-1 bg-black bottom-0 left-0 w-0 group-hover:w-full transition-all duration-200"></span>
</a>
```

In the above code, the `group` class is added to the `a` element. This allows the `group-hover` variant to work on the `span` element.

Finally, you need to enable the `group-hover` variant in your Tailwind CSS configuration. You can do this by adding `group-hover` to the `variants` section of your `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  variants: {
    extend: {
      width: ['group-hover'],
    }
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

In the above code, the `group-hover` variant is enabled for the `width` utility. This allows you to change the width of an element when its parent is hovered.

With these changes, your link should now have the desired hover animation.
