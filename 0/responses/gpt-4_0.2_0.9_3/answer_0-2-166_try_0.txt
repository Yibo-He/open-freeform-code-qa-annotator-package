It seems like you accidentally left out the method you want to use to access the direct children of the div with class "section". However, I'll provide you with a few common ways to do this in JavaScript and jQuery:

1. JavaScript:

```javascript
let section = document.querySelector('.section');
let children = section.children;
```

In this code, `children` will be a HTMLCollection of the direct children of the div with class "section".

2. jQuery:

```javascript
let children = $('.section').children();
```

In this code, `children` will be a jQuery object containing the direct children of the div with class "section".
