I've reviewed your code and the video you provided. Here's how you can create a similar effect using Tailwind CSS.

Firstly, you need to add the `group` class to the parent element of the link. This allows you to target child elements when the parent is hovered over.

Next, you need to create an underline element using the `::after` pseudo-element. You can't directly apply pseudo-classes or pseudo-elements in Tailwind CSS, so you need to use custom CSS for this.

Finally, you need to animate the underline element when the link is hovered over. You can use the `transition`, `transform`, and `group-hover` utilities in Tailwind CSS for this.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```html
<div class="group inline-block">
  <a href="#" class="text-blue-500 hover:text-blue-800 transition-colors duration-200">
    Hover me
  </a>
  <style>
    .group:hover a::after {
      width: 100%;
    }
    .group a::after {
      content: '';
      display: block;
      width: 0;
      height: 2px;
      background: currentColor;
      transition: width .3s;
    }
  </style>
</div>
```

In this example, the underline element is initially hidden (width: 0). When the link is hovered over, the width of the underline element is set to 100%, creating the slide-in effect. The transition utility is used to animate the change in width.

Please note that you need to configure Tailwind CSS to enable the `group-hover` variant for the `transform` and `transition` utilities. You can do this in the `tailwind.config.js` file:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  variants: {
    extend: {
      transform: ['group-hover'],
      transitionProperty: ['group-hover'],
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
