The error message you're seeing is because TypeScript is unable to find a declaration for `process.env`. This is because `process.env` is a Node.js global variable, and TypeScript does not include Node.js type definitions by default.

To fix this issue, you need to install the Node.js type definitions. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @types/node
```

After you've installed the type definitions, you should be able to use `process.env` without any issues.

However, if you're using Vue CLI, you should note that all environment variables that start with `VUE_APP_` will be automatically loaded into your Vue application. So, you could use `process.env.VUE_APP_APP_ENV` instead of `process.env.APP_ENV`.

Also, remember to define your environment variables in a `.env` file at the root of your project. For example:

```
VUE_APP_APP_ENV=prod
```

And then in your code, you can access this variable like this:

```typescript
const isProduct = process.env.VUE_APP_APP_ENV === "prod";
```

This way, you are following the Vue CLI's convention for environment variables, and you don't need to worry about the TypeScript error.
