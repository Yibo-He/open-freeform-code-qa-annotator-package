The issue here is that TypeScript is not able to resolve the path to your type definition file. TypeScript has a special handling for `@types/` directory which is used for declaration files of libraries that don't provide their own.

Here's how you can solve this:

1. First, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the `src` directory in the `include` array:

```json
{
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

2. Then, you can import your type using a relative path:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '../@types/app';
```

The `../` part may vary depending on the structure of your project. Adjust it so that it points to the correct location of your `@types` directory.

3. If you want to avoid using relative paths, you can add a `paths` configuration in your `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@types/*": ["@types/*"]
    }
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

Then, you can import your type like this:

```tsx
import { AuthKeyT } from '@types/app';
```

This tells TypeScript to look for `@types` in the `src` directory.
