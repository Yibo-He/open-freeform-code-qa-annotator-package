The error message `EACCES` means that the Node.js process does not have sufficient permissions to execute the file at the specified path. 

You can try to change the permissions of the Chromium.app file to make it executable. You can do this with the `chmod` command in the terminal:

```bash
chmod +x /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
```

This command changes the permissions of the file to make it executable by the user. The `+x` flag adds execute permissions.

If this doesn't work, you might need to change the ownership of the file or directory with the `chown` command:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER /Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app
```

This command changes the owner of the file or directory to the current user. The `-R` flag applies the command recursively to all files and directories within the specified directory.

If none of these solutions work, there might be an issue with the path you're providing to the `executablePath` option. Make sure that the path points directly to the executable file, not just the .app directory. For example, the path might need to be something like `/Users/iliebogdanbarbulescu/Downloads/firstProject/node_modules/chromium/lib/chromium/chrome-mac/Chromium.app/Contents/MacOS/Chromium`.
