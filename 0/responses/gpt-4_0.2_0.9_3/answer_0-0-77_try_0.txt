To make Axios send cookies automatically in every request, you need to set the `withCredentials` property to `true` in the Axios request configuration. This will include cookies in the request headers.

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
axios.get('some api url', { withCredentials: true })
  .then(response => {
    // handle success
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle error
  });
```

If you want to set `withCredentials` to `true` for all requests, you can do it globally like this:

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

Now, all your Axios requests will automatically include cookies.

Please note that for CORS requests, the server must also include the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` header set to `true` in the response, and the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header must not be set to `*` but to the specific origin making the request. 

Here is how you can do it in your Express.js server:

```javascript
app.use(function(req, res, next) {
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials', true);
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin', req.headers.origin);
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods', 'GET,PUT,POST,DELETE');
  res.header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers', 'X-Requested-With, X-HTTP-Method-Override, Content-Type, Accept');
  next();
});
```

Remember to replace `req.headers.origin` with your specific client-side domain.
