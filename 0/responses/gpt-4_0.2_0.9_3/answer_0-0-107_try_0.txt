The error message you're seeing is due to the execution policy settings in your PowerShell. PowerShell has a feature called "execution policies" to help control the execution of scripts on your system. By default, the policy is set to "Restricted", which means no scripts like your `expo.ps1` are allowed to run.

You can change the execution policy using the `Set-ExecutionPolicy` cmdlet. Here's how to do it:

1. Open a PowerShell as Administrator. You can do this by searching for PowerShell in the Start menu, right-clicking on it, and selecting "Run as Administrator".

2. Run the following command:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```

This will set the policy to "RemoteSigned", which means that as long as a script is signed by a trusted publisher, it will run.

3. You will be prompted to confirm the change. Type `Y` and press Enter to confirm.

4. Try running your `expo --version` command again.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to set the execution policy to "Unrestricted". However, please note that this setting is less secure as it allows all scripts to run:

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
```

Remember to set the execution policy back to its original setting once you're done to maintain the security of your system.
