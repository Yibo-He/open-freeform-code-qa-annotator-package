As of the current version of React (17.0.2), there is no hook equivalent to `componentDidCatch` or `getDerivedStateFromError`. Error boundaries must be class components.

The React team has mentioned that they are considering adding this feature in the future, but as of now, there is no way to catch errors in a function component.

So, for now, you have to use class components to catch errors. Here is an example of how you can do it:

```jsx
class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }

  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }

  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }

    return this.props.children; 
  }
}
```

You can use it as a regular component to wrap any part of your application:

```jsx
<ErrorBoundary>
  <MyComponent />
</ErrorBoundary>
```

In this example, if `MyComponent` throws an error during rendering, the `ErrorBoundary` will catch it, log it to your service, and render a fallback UI.
