This error is typically caused by a mismatch in dependencies or a corrupted node_modules folder. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:** Sometimes, the node_modules folder or the package-lock.json file can become corrupted. Delete both the node_modules folder and the package-lock.json file from your project directory.

2. **Clear npm cache:** Run the following command to clear the npm cache:

    ```
    npm cache clean --force
    ```

3. **Reinstall dependencies:** Run the following command to reinstall your project dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

4. **Update next.js:** If the error persists, it might be due to a bug in the version of next.js you are using. You can update next.js by running:

    ```
    npm install next@latest
    ```

5. **Check your code:** If the error still persists, check your code to ensure that you are not trying to extend an undefined class. The error message suggests that somewhere in your code, a class is trying to extend something that is undefined.

If none of the above steps work, please provide more details about your project setup, including the versions of Node.js and npm you are using, as well as the contents of your package.json file.
