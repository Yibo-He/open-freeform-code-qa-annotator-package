The error you're encountering is due to the fact that the `graphql-upload` package has undergone some significant changes in its latest versions. The `graphqlUploadExpress` middleware has been removed in version 11.0.0 and later. 

You're using version 14.0.0 of `graphql-upload`, so you won't be able to import `graphqlUploadExpress` from it. 

If you want to continue using `graphqlUploadExpress`, you'll need to downgrade your `graphql-upload` package to version 10.0.0 or earlier. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm uninstall graphql-upload
npm install graphql-upload@10.0.0
```

However, please note that using older versions might lack some features or bug fixes provided in the newer versions.

If you want to use the latest version of `graphql-upload`, you'll need to adjust your code to work without `graphqlUploadExpress`. The `graphql-upload` package now provides a `processRequest` function that you can use to process upload requests. Here's an example of how you might use it:

```javascript
import { processRequest } from 'graphql-upload';

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  if (req.is('multipart/form-data')) {
    processRequest(req, res)
      .then(body => {
        req.body = body;
        next();
      })
      .catch(next);
  } else {
    next();
  }
});
```

This middleware will process multipart form data requests (which are used for file uploads) and add the processed data to `req.body`.
