This is a known issue with Safari and flexbox. Safari has some problems with `height: auto` for images inside a flex container. 

A workaround for this issue is to wrap the image in a div and apply the flex properties to the div instead of the image. 

Here is an updated version of your code:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container .img-container {
  width: 125px;
}

.container img {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

```html
<div class="container">
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/250">
    </div>
  </section>
  <section>
    <div class="img-container">
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150">
    </div>
  </section>
</div>
```

In this version, the `img` tag is wrapped in a div with class `img-container`. The `width: 125px;` is applied to `.img-container` and the `img` tag has `width: 100%;` and `height: auto;`. This should maintain the aspect ratio of the image in Safari.
