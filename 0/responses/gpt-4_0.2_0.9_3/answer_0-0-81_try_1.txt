The error message suggests that the JavaScript bundle is not being found when the app is running in release mode. This is a common issue when you're trying to run your React Native app in release mode without having bundled your JavaScript files.

Here are the steps to generate a JavaScript bundle manually:

1. Create a folder in your project directory named `assets` inside `android/app/src/main`.

2. Run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npx react-native bundle --platform android --dev false --entry-file index.js --bundle-output android/app/src/main/assets/index.android.bundle --assets-dest android/app/src/main/res
```

This command generates the JavaScript bundle for the Android platform in release mode. The `--entry-file` parameter specifies the entry point to your application. If your entry file is different, change `index.js` to your entry file. The `--bundle-output` and `--assets-dest` parameters specify where the bundle and resources will be outputted.

3. After running the command, you should see `index.android.bundle` in the `android/app/src/main/assets` directory.

4. Now you can create your release build:

```bash
npx react-native run-android --variant=release
```

If you're still having issues, make sure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file is set up to bundle the file in release mode:

```groovy
project.ext.react = [
    enableHermes: false,  // clean and rebuild if changing
    bundleInRelease: true
]
```

This will ensure that the JavaScript bundle is included in your APK.
