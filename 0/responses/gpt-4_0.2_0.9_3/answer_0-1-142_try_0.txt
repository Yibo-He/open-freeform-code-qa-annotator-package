You can use the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class selector to select the first element among the group of siblings. Here is how you can modify your locator:

```css
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:first-of-type
```

This will select the first `span` element that is a direct child of an element with the class `flex` within the element having `data-cy` attribute as `offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer`.

However, if the first `span` is not the one you want (i.e., "Joined"), you may need to use `:nth-of-type(n)` or `:nth-child(n)` where `n` is the index of the element. Remember that CSS uses 1-based indexing, not 0-based like in most programming languages.

For example, if "Joined" is the second `span`, you would use:

```css
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:nth-of-type(2)
```

If you're using JavaScript to interact with the DOM, you can use the `querySelector` or `querySelectorAll` method to get the element:

```javascript
// Get the first span
let firstSpan = document.querySelector('[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:first-of-type');

// Get the second span
let secondSpan = document.querySelector('[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:nth-of-type(2)');
```
