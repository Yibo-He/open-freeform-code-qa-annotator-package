The warning message you're seeing is due to a change in how `::v-deep` is used in Vue 3. The new syntax is `::v-deep(<inner-selector>)`. 

So, you should change your CSS from:

```css
.parent ::v-deep .child {
   ...
}
```

To:

```css
.parent ::v-deep(.child) {
   ...
}
```

This new syntax is more explicit and helps to avoid potential parsing ambiguity.
