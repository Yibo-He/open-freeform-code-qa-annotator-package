You can use the `:first-of-type` pseudo-class to select the first element among the 4 elements. Here is how you can modify your locator:

```javascript
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:first-of-type
```

This will select the first `span` element inside the `.flex` class. If this doesn't work, it might be because the `span` elements are not direct siblings. In that case, you can use the `:nth-child()` pseudo-class to select the specific `span` element:

```javascript
[data-cy="offerBreakUpTableHeaderCellRenderer"] .flex span:nth-child(1)
```

This will select the first `span` element inside the `.flex` class. 

Please note that the `:first-of-type` and `:nth-child()` pseudo-classes work based on the type of the element and its position among its siblings, not its position inside the parent element.
