It seems like you are on the right track. You are using Angular's DomSanitizer to sanitize the base64 image URL. However, you are not using the sanitized URL in your template. 

Here's how you can do it:

In your component:

```typescript
import { DomSanitizer, SafeResourceUrl } from '@angular/platform-browser';

export class YourComponent {
  base64Image: SafeResourceUrl;

  constructor(private _sanitizer: DomSanitizer) {
    this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
    this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl('data:image/jpg;base64,' + this.ImgUrl);
  }
}
```

In your template:

```html
<img [src]="base64Image" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```

In the above code, we are using property binding to bind the sanitized URL to the `src` attribute of the `img` tag. This way, Angular knows that the URL is safe to use.
