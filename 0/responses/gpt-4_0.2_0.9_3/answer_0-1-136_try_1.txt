The issue is likely due to the `row` class in your parent div. The CSS you've written is for vertical scrolling, but the `row` class (which is commonly used in frameworks like Bootstrap) is typically used for horizontal layouts.

If you're using a CSS framework that defines `row` as a horizontal layout, it may be overriding your vertical scroll settings. Try removing the `row` class from your parent div:

```html
<div class="parent">
  <section class="one">
  </section>
  <section class="two">
  </section>
  <section class="three">
  </section>
  <section class="four">
  </section>
</div>
```

Also, you have a redundant `scroll-snap-type` property in your `.parent` class. You can remove `scroll-snap-type: mandatory;` because `scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;` is enough for vertical scrolling.

```css
.parent {
  height: 100vh;
  scroll-snap-points-y: repeat(100vh);
  scroll-snap-type: y mandatory;
}
```

If you want to keep the `row` class for some reason, you need to make sure it doesn't conflict with your vertical scroll settings.
