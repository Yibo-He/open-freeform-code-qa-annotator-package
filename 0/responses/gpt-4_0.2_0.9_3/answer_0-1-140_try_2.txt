Font Awesome 5 has made some changes in how it is used compared to Font Awesome 4. The main change is that the free version of Font Awesome 5 uses SVG icons instead of font icons. 

However, if you want to use Font Awesome 5 as a font (like Font Awesome 4), you can use the "Web Fonts with CSS" version of Font Awesome 5. 

Here is how you can use it:

1. First, make sure you have included the correct CSS file in your HTML:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.15.4/css/all.css">
```

2. Then, you can use the Font Awesome 5 icons in your CSS like this:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';
  font-weight: 900; /* This is necessary for Font Awesome 5 */
}
```

Please note that you need to specify `font-weight: 900;` for Font Awesome 5 Free. This is because Font Awesome 5 Free icons are only available in the Solid style, which corresponds to a font weight of 900. 

If you are using Font Awesome 5 Pro, you can use different font weights to get different styles of icons (Light, Regular, Solid).
