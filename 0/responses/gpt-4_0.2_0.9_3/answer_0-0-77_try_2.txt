To make Axios send cookies automatically in every request, you need to set the `withCredentials` property to `true` in the global Axios defaults. This will include cookies in the headers of every request made by Axios.

Here is how you can do it:

```javascript
axios.defaults.withCredentials = true;
```

After setting this, Axios will automatically include cookies in the headers of every request. 

Please note that for CORS requests, the server must also be configured to allow credentials. In Express.js, you can do this by setting the `credentials` option to `true` in the CORS middleware:

```javascript
app.use(cors({
  origin: 'http://your-website.com', // replace with your client URL
  credentials: true
}));
```

Also, make sure that the domain of the cookie matches the domain of the request URL. If they don't match, the cookie will not be included in the request.
