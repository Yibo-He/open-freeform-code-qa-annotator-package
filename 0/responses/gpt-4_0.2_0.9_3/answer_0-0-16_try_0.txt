The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to explicitly set the `android:exported` attribute for activities, services, and broadcast receivers that have intent filters.

In your `config.xml` file, you have an intent filter defined for `MainActivity` but you haven't set the `android:exported` attribute for the activity itself. The `android:exported` attribute determines whether or not components of other applications can invoke the activity or whether the activity can be started with an intent that is not explicitly targeting it.

You can fix this issue by adding the `android:exported` attribute to the activity in the `config.xml` file. However, Cordova doesn't directly support this. You'll need to use a plugin like `cordova-plugin-custom-config` to add custom configuration to the AndroidManifest.xml file.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Install the `cordova-plugin-custom-config` plugin:

```bash
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-custom-config
```

2. Add the following lines to your `config.xml` file:

```xml
<platform name="android">
    <config-file parent="/manifest/application/activity[@android:name='MainActivity']" target="AndroidManifest.xml">
        <activity android:exported="true" />
    </config-file>
</platform>
```

This will add the `android:exported="true"` attribute to the `MainActivity` in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.

Please note that setting `android:exported="true"` means that the activity can be launched by components of other apps. If you don't want this, set it to `false` but make sure that the activity is not intended to receive intents from other apps.
