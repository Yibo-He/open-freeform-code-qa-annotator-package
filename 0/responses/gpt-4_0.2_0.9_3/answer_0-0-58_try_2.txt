The error message you're seeing is related to a checksum mismatch. This can occur when the package's contents have changed between the time they were added to the npm registry and the time you tried to install them.

Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update npm**: The version of npm you're using is quite old. It's possible that the issue you're experiencing has been fixed in a newer version. You can update npm by running `sudo npm install -g npm@latest`.

2. **Clear npm cache**: You've already tried this, but it's worth repeating after updating npm. Run `npm cache clean --force`.

3. **Delete `node_modules`**: If the problem persists, try deleting the `node_modules` directory and then running `npm install` again. You can delete the directory with `rm -rf node_modules`.

4. **Check your network connection**: If you're behind a proxy or have a slow/unstable internet connection, it could be causing this issue. Try switching to a different network if possible.

5. **Try using a different package registry**: npm has a few different registries you can use. If the default one isn't working for you, you can try using a different one. For example, you can use the registry provided by Taobao by running `npm config set registry https://registry.npm.taobao.org`.

Remember to run `sudo npm install` again after each step to see if the problem has been resolved.
