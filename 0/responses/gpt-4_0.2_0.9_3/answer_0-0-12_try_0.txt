The error message is not provided in your question, but I can suggest a few common issues that might be causing your problem:

1. **Less secure apps**: Google may block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that do not use modern security standards. You need to allow less secure apps to access your account. You can do this by going to your Google Account > Security > Less secure app access > Turn on access.

2. **Two-Step Verification**: If you have enabled Two-Step Verification for your Gmail account, you need to generate an App Password and use that instead of your regular password. You can do this by going to your Google Account > Security > App passwords.

3. **Incorrect credentials**: Make sure the email and password you are using are correct.

4. **Nodemailer version**: Make sure you are using the latest version of Nodemailer.

5. **Internet connection**: Check your internet connection. Sometimes, a poor internet connection can cause this issue.

If you are still facing the issue, please provide the error message for a more specific solution.
