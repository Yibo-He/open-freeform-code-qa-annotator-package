The error message indicates that the template name is incorrect. The correct command should be:

```
npx react-native init MyApp --template react-native-template-typescript
```

You have repeated the "react-native-template-" part in your command, which is causing the error. The correct template name is "react-native-template-typescript", not "react-native-template-react-native-template-typescript".
