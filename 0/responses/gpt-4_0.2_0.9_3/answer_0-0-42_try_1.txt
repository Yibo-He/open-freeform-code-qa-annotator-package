The error message you're seeing is because the `connect-mongo` package has been updated and the way you're using it is no longer valid. 

In the latest version of `connect-mongo`, you need to use it like this:

```javascript
const session = require('express-session');
const MongoStore = require('connect-mongo');

app.use(session({
    secret: 'story book',
    resave: false,
    saveUninitialized: false,
    store: MongoStore.create({ mongoUrl: 'mongodb://localhost/test-app' })
}));
```

You need to replace `'mongodb://localhost/test-app'` with your own MongoDB connection string. 

The `mongooseConnection` option is no longer used in the latest version of `connect-mongo`. Instead, you should use the `mongoUrl` option to provide the MongoDB connection string.

If you want to use the old syntax, you need to install an older version of `connect-mongo`. You can do this by running `npm install connect-mongo@3.2.0`. However, it's generally a good idea to use the latest version of a package, because it will have the latest features and bug fixes.
