The warning message you're seeing is due to a change in how `::v-deep` is used in Vue 3. In Vue 2, `::v-deep` was used as a combinator, but in Vue 3, it's used as a function.

The correct way to use `::v-deep` in Vue 3 would be to include the inner selector within the parentheses. Here's how you can modify your CSS:

```css
.parent ::v-deep(.child) {
   ...
}
```

This change was made to make the usage of `::v-deep` more consistent and predictable.
