It seems like you're having trouble with Rails' asset pipeline. The asset pipeline is a powerful feature in Rails that makes it easy to write and manage your CSS, JavaScript, and other assets. However, it can sometimes cause confusion, especially when it comes to caching and precompiling assets.

Here's a few things you can try:

1. **Disable caching in development**: Rails may be caching your assets in development, which can cause changes to not appear until you clear the cache or restart the server. You can disable this by setting `config.assets.debug = true` in your `config/environments/development.rb` file.

2. **Disable precompiling in development**: Similarly, Rails may be precompiling your assets in development, which can cause changes to not appear until you recompile the assets. You can disable this by setting `config.assets.compile = false` in your `config/environments/development.rb` file.

3. **Use the `rails dev:cache` command**: This command toggles development mode caching on and off. If it's on, you'll see a message saying "Development mode is now being cached." If it's off, you'll see a message saying "Development mode is no longer being cached." Try running this command and see if it helps.

4. **Check your CSS syntax**: If there's a syntax error in your CSS, Rails may not be able to parse it, which can cause changes to not appear. Make sure your CSS is valid and doesn't contain any errors.

5. **Check your file paths**: Make sure the paths to your CSS files are correct. If Rails can't find your CSS files, it won't be able to apply your changes.

6. **Try a hard refresh**: Sometimes, your browser may cache your CSS, which can cause changes to not appear. You can do a hard refresh by pressing `Ctrl + F5` (or `Cmd + Shift + R` on a Mac).

If none of these solutions work, there may be a deeper issue with your Rails setup. In that case, you may want to consider seeking help from a Rails expert or a Rails community forum.
