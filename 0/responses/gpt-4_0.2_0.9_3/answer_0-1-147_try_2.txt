Yes, in Laravel 8, the `laravel/ui` package has been replaced by the `laravel/breeze` and `laravel/jetstream` packages. These packages provide a simple starting point for building a Laravel application with authentication, powered by Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js.

Here is how you can install Bootstrap in Laravel 8:

1. First, you need to install the `laravel/breeze` package. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
composer require laravel/breeze --dev
```

2. After the package is installed, you can use the `breeze:install` Artisan command to install the authentication scaffolding:

```bash
php artisan breeze:install
```

By default, this command will install the views and routes for login, registration, password reset, and email verification. It will also install a dashboard view and route.

3. If you want to use Bootstrap, you can specify it as an option when running the `breeze:install` command:

```bash
php artisan breeze:install bootstrap
```

4. After running the `breeze:install` command, you should compile your assets using the `npm install && npm run dev` command:

```bash
npm install && npm run dev
```

This will install all necessary npm packages and compile your CSS and JavaScript assets.

5. Finally, you need to run the migrations with the `migrate` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

This will create the necessary tables in your database.

Now, you should have a Laravel 8 application with Bootstrap installed.
