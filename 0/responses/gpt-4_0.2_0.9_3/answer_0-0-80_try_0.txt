The `disabled` attribute is a boolean attribute. When it is present, regardless of its actual value, the element is disabled. This means that setting `disabled="false"` will actually disable the element.

In Angular, you can conditionally add or remove the `disabled` attribute by binding it to a null value to remove it, or to an empty string to add it.

So, you can try this:

```html
<select [attr.disabled]="editable ? null : ''">
...
</select>
```

In this case, if `editable` is `true`, `null` will be returned and the `disabled` attribute will be removed. If `editable` is `false`, an empty string will be returned and the `disabled` attribute will be added, disabling the select element.
