Yes, there is a way to run only one test in Cypress. You can use the `.only` method to specify the test you want to run. This method is added to either `it` or `describe` to isolate the test case or test suite respectively.

Here is an example:

```javascript
describe('My Test Suite', () => {
  it.only('My Test Case', () => {
    // Your test code here
  });

  it('Another Test Case', () => {
    // This test will be skipped
  });
});
```

In this example, only 'My Test Case' will be run, and 'Another Test Case' will be skipped.

Remember to remove `.only` after you're done, to ensure all tests are being run as expected.
