This is indeed a known issue with Safari and its handling of flexbox and images. Safari has some problems with the `height: auto` property on images within flex containers.

To fix this issue, you can use `align-self: flex-start` on the image. This will align the image at the start of the cross axis, which in this case is vertical, and it will stop the image from stretching.

Here is the updated CSS:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

.container section:first-child {
  display: flex;
  margin-bottom: 25px;
}

.container img {
  width: 125px;
  height: auto;
  align-self: flex-start; /* Add this line */
}
```

This should solve your problem in Safari without affecting the layout in other browsers.
