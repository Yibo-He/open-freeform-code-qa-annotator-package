The error message you're seeing is saying that `req.logout()` requires a callback function. However, according to the Passport.js documentation, `req.logout()` does not require a callback function. 

The error might be due to a version mismatch or some other issue. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Update your Passport.js to the latest version. You can do this by running `npm update passport` in your terminal.

2. Make sure you're not calling `req.logout()` twice in your code. I noticed that you have two `app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {...})` in your code. If the first one is called and the user is logged out, the second one will throw an error because the user is already logged out.

3. Try to add a callback function to `req.logout()` to see if it solves the problem, even though it shouldn't be necessary according to the documentation. Here's how you can do it:

```javascript
app.get("/logout", (req, res) => {
    req.logout(() => {
        res.redirect("/");
    });
});
```

4. If none of the above solutions work, try to delete your `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file, and then run `npm install` again to reinstall your packages. Sometimes, this can solve issues caused by package version mismatches or corrupted packages.
