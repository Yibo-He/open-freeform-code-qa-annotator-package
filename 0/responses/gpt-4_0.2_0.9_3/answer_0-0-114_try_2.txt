1. Open `System Preferences` on your Mac.
2. Click on `Security & Privacy`.
3. Go to the `General` tab.
4. At the bottom of the window, you should see a message like "`Flipper` was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer."
5. Click the lock to make changes, you will be asked to enter your password.
6. After entering your password, click `Open Anyway` next to the message about `Flipper`.
7. A dialog box will appear warning you about the app you're about to open. Click `Open`.

After following these steps, you should be able to run `Flipper` on your Mac. If you're still having trouble, please let me know.
