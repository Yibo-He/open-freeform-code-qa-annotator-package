Yes, you can detect if the user's system is in dark mode using CSS media queries or JavaScript.

Here's how you can do it:

**CSS:**
```css
@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  /* Dark mode styles go here */
}
```
This media query will apply the styles inside it if the user's system is set to dark mode.

**JavaScript:**
```javascript
if (window.matchMedia && window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches) {
  // Dark mode
}
```
This JavaScript code will execute the code inside the if statement if the user's system is set to dark mode.

You can also listen for changes with JavaScript:
```javascript
window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').addEventListener('change', e => {
  const newColorScheme = e.matches ? "dark" : "light";
});
```
This code will execute whenever the user changes their system color scheme.
