The error message is not provided in your question, but I assume you might be facing issues with importing jQuery and Bootstrap in your React project.

Firstly, you need to install jQuery and Bootstrap in your project. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

```
npm install jquery
npm install bootstrap
```

Then, you can import them in your project like this:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.css';
import './index.css';
import $ from 'jquery';
import Popper from 'popper.js';
import 'bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

In this code, `$` is the standard symbol for jQuery. `Popper.js` is required for the tooltips and popovers in Bootstrap.

If you're still facing issues, please provide the error message so I can assist you better.
