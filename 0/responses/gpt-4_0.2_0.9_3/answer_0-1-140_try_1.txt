In Font Awesome 5, the way to use icons in CSS has changed a bit. Now, you need to specify the font-weight as well because Font Awesome 5 has different weights for some icons.

Here's how you can modify your CSS:

```css
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free';
  font-weight: 900;
}
```

You need to make sure that you have included the correct Font Awesome 5 CSS file in your HTML. For example:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.0.13/css/all.css">
```

Also, ensure that the unicode you are using ("\f107") corresponds to the correct icon in Font Awesome 5. Some icons have different unicodes in Font Awesome 5 compared to Font Awesome 4. You can check the correct unicode on the Font Awesome website.

If you are using Font Awesome Pro, you might need to use 'Font Awesome 5 Pro' as the font-family.
