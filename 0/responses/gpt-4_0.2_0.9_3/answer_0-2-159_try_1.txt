The problem you're experiencing might be due to the path of the image you're trying to display. The `src` attribute in the `img` tag is used to specify the path of the image. If the image is in the same directory as your HTML file, you can just put the image name with its extension (like you did). But if it's in another directory, you need to specify the path correctly.

Here are some examples:

- If your image is in a subdirectory, you would use something like this: `src="images/hologram.jpg"`
- If your image is in a parent directory, you would use something like this: `src="../hologram.jpg"`

So, in your case, you should check the path of your image. If it's not in the same directory as your HTML file, you need to adjust the `src` attribute accordingly.

Also, make sure that the image file actually exists and the name is spelled correctly, including the file extension. File names are case-sensitive on some systems, so `hologram.jpg` is different from `Hologram.jpg`.

Lastly, ensure that the image is in a format that the browser can display. Most browsers can display JPEG, PNG, and GIF images. If your image is in a different format, you might need to convert it to a format the browser can handle.
