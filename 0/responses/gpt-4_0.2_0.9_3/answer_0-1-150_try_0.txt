You can create a triangle using Tailwind CSS without a plugin by using the utility classes for width, height, and background color. However, Tailwind CSS does not have built-in classes for borders or shapes like triangles. 

But you can extend the functionality of Tailwind CSS by adding custom styles in your CSS file. Here's an example of how you can create a triangle:

```html
<div class="triangle"></div>
```

And in your CSS file:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

@layer components {
  .triangle {
    width: 0;
    height: 0;
    border-left: 50px solid transparent;
    border-right: 50px solid transparent;
    border-bottom: 100px solid red;
  }
}
```

This will create a red triangle pointing upwards. You can adjust the size of the triangle by changing the border sizes. The color of the triangle can be changed by modifying the border-bottom color.

Remember to build your CSS again if you're using Tailwind with PostCSS:

```bash
npx tailwindcss build styles.css -o output.css
```

This command will take your CSS file (styles.css), process it, and create a new CSS file (output.css) with the processed styles.
