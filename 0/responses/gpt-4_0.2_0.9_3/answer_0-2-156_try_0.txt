1) To align the stop button with the begin button, you can adjust the `top` property of the `#StopBtn` in your CSS. Here is the updated CSS for the stop button:

```css
#StopBtn{
    position: fixed;
    left: 500px;
    top: 10px; /* Adjust this value to align with the start button */
    /* ... rest of your styles ... */
}
```

2) To move the bottom arrows up, you can add a `margin-bottom` to the `#controls` in your CSS. Here is the updated CSS for the controls:

```css
#controls {
    padding-left: 350px;
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Adjust this value to move the arrows up */
}
```

3) To add color to the text "Points Earned" and "Click to start the game", you can add a `color` property to the `.Status` and `.Points` classes in your CSS. Here is the updated CSS for the status and points:

```css
.Status {
    color: #ff0000; /* Change this to the color you want */
    /* ... rest of your styles ... */
}

.Points {
    color: #00ff00; /* Change this to the color you want */
    /* ... rest of your styles ... */
}
```

Remember to replace the color values with the colors you want.
