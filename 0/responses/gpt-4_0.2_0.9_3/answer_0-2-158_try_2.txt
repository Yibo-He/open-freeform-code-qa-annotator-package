`::ng-deep` is a pseudo-class selector used in Angular to force a style down through the child component views. It allows you to apply styles to any child elements (deep elements), which is useful when you want to override the styles of child components from the parent component.

Here is an example of how to use `::ng-deep`:

```css
:host ::ng-deep .child-component-class {
  /* your styles here */
}
```

In this example, the styles will be applied to `.child-component-class` of the child components.

However, it's important to note that `::ng-deep` is deprecated and it's not a standard feature, but it still works in Angular 4 and later versions. The Angular team has not yet provided a clear alternative for `::ng-deep`, so it's still commonly used.

As for the IE11 support, `::ng-deep` is not related to the browser but to the Angular framework itself. It's a way to make the styles bypass the Shadow DOM scoping. So yes, it will work in IE11 as long as you're using Angular.

Remember to use `::ng-deep` sparingly and avoid it if possible, because it breaks the encapsulation of styles.
