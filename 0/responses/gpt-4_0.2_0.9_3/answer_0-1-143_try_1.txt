Yes, you can modify the userChrome.css file to customize the appearance of Firefox's user interface, including the spacing between menu items. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, you need to enable the ability to use this file in Firefox. Type `about:config` in the address bar and press Enter. Click "Accept the Risk and Continue". In the search bar, type `toolkit.legacyUserProfileCustomizations.stylesheets` and set its value to `true` by clicking on the arrow button.

2. Now, you need to locate your Firefox profile folder. Type `about:support` in the address bar and press Enter. Under the "Application Basics" section, find "Profile Directory" and click on "Open Directory".

3. In the profile directory, create a new folder named `chrome` if it doesn't already exist.

4. Inside the `chrome` folder, create a new file named `userChrome.css`. If the file already exists, you can just edit it.

5. Open `userChrome.css` with a text editor and paste the following code:

```css
/* Reduce Menu and Contextual Menu height */
:root {
  --arrowpanel-menuitem-padding: 4px 8px !important;
}

menupopup > menuitem, menupopup > menu {
  padding-block: var(--arrowpanel-menuitem-padding) !important;
}
```

6. Save the file and close it.

7. Restart Firefox for the changes to take effect.

This CSS code reduces the padding around menu items, effectively reducing the spacing between them. You can adjust the `4px 8px` values to your liking. The first value is the vertical padding (top and bottom) and the second value is the horizontal padding (left and right).
