Why `downlevelIteration` is not on by default?

When targeting ES5 with usage of spread operator `...` to convert an `Iterator` to an `Array`, it shows the error to use `-downlevelIteration` compiler option. Once it is on, spread operators seem just work flawlessly.

I wonder why is there a need to specify this? Are there any downsides/limitation when it is enabled besides adding more emitted generated code from tslib?

Another example:  (eg. 3):

```
[...Array(3).keys()]  // output: [0, 1, 2]
```


It displays an error in VS Code:

Error message from `tsc`:

> Type 'IterableIterator' is not an array type or a string type. Use compiler option '--downlevelIteration' to allow iterating of iterators.

[Edit and view the code and error in TypeScript Playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/#src=%5B...Array(3).keys()%5D)
