Make plus symbol in CSS

I have the below CSS code which gives the  symbol but not matches the design basically it needs to be thin. See snippet and [codpen](https://codepen.io/anon/pen/ywQOqQ)

```
.plus {
  position:relative;
  border: 1px dotted white;
  width: 3px;
  height: 3px;
  background-color: black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  transform: scale(11);
}
```
```
<div class="plus"></div>
```



Should Look like the below symbol: [](https://i.stack.imgur.com/Uc3zT.png)

Any other styling is also fine for me but should look like the snapshot.
