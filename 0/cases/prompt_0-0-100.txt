Error: Failed to load parser 'babel-eslint' declared in '.eslintrc': Cannot find module 'babel-eslint' in create-react-app

Trying to install [eslint](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint) into [create-react-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-app), but get next error when running linter:

Here is my `.eslintrc` config file:

```
{
  "extends": ["airbnb", "prettier", "prettier/react"],
  "plugins": ["prettier"],
  "parser": "babel-eslint"
}
```


If install `babel-eslint` manually it'll potentially produce another error based on package conflict between  project and `react-scripts` dependencies:
