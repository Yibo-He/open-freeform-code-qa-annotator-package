How to push to vue-router without adding to history?

I have the following sequence happening:

- Main screen- Loading screen- Results screen

On homepage, when someone clicks a button, I send them to the loading screen, thru:

`this.$router.push({path: "/loading"});`

And once their task finishes, they are sent to the results screen via  

`this.$router.push({path: "/results/xxxx"});`

The problem is, usually they want to go from results back to the main screen, but when they click back, they're sent to loading again which sends them back to results, so they're stuck in an infinite loop & unable to go back to main screen.

Any ideas how to fix this? I'd ideally like if there was an option like:

`this.$router.push({path: "/loading", addToHistory: false});`

which would send them to the route without adding it to history.
