Make Axios send cookies in its requests automatically

I am sending requests from the client to my Express.js server using Axios. 

I set a cookie on the client and I want to read that cookie from all Axios requests without adding them manually to request by hand. 

This is my clientside request example:

```
axios.get(`some api url`).then(response => ...
```


I tried to access headers or cookies by using these properties in my Express.js server:

```
req.headers
req.cookies
```


Neither of them contained any cookies. I am using cookie parser middleware:

```
app.use(cookieParser())
```


How do I make Axios send cookies in requests automatically? 

Edit:

I set cookie on the client like this:

```
import cookieClient from 'react-cookie'

...
let cookie = cookieClient.load('cookie-name')
if(cookie === undefined){
      axios.get('path/to/my/cookie/api').then(response => {
        if(response.status == 200){
          cookieClient.save('cookie-name', response.data, {path:'/'})
        }
      })
    }
...
```


While it's also using Axios, it is not relevant to the question. I simply want to embed cookies into all my requests once a cookie is set.
