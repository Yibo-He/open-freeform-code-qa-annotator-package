TypeError: _API.default is not a constructor with Jest tests

I have an API class that I am trying to use in a React app.
```
// API file

class API {
...
}

export default API;

// Other file
import API from "utils/API";

const api = new API();
```

And I am getting the error:
```
TypeError: _API.default is not a constructor
```

But.. it seems like my default is set?
My Jest setup is like this:
```
"jest": {
    "setupFiles": [
      "./jestSetupFile.js"
    ],
    "testEnvironment": "jsdom",
    "preset": "jest-expo",
    "transformIgnorePatterns": [
      "node_modules/(?!((jest-)?react-native|@react-native(-community)?)|expo(nent)?|@expo(nent)?/.*|@expo-google-fonts/.*|react-navigation|@react-navigation/.*|@unimodules/.*|unimodules|sentry-expo|native-base|react-native-svg|react-router-native/.*|@invertase/react-native-apple-authentication/.*)"
    ]
  },
```

My  guess is that this is due to a configuration of my babel, webpack or package.json.
What could be causing this?
Note, I want to be clear, this doesn't happen whatsoever in my main application,  in Jest testing

If I change it to a named export/import, I get this:
```
TypeError: _API.API is not a constructor
```

 confusing behavior.
