How to upgrade Vue version

I was using the Vue version (2.5), I ran that command `npm install -g @vue/cli` after that I check my vue version by using the command `vue --version`and it shows me `@vue/cli 4.1.2`. but in my package.json file the version did not upgrade, it still showing me the older version i.e 2.5.7.
