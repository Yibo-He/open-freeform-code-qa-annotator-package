Link with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" still vulnerable?

I see people recommending that whenever one uses `target="_blank"` in a link to open it in a different window, they should put `rel="noopener noreferrer"`. I wonder how does this prevent me from using Developer Tools in Chrome, for example, and removing the rel attribute. Then clicking the link...

Is that an easy way to still keep the vulnerability?
