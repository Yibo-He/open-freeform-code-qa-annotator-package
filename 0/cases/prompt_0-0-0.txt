How to get data from nested objects in the form of array

As you can see, the keys are now the name of the items and the corresponding value is another object consisting of two keys - quantity and price.
```
var itemsToBuy = {
    milk: {
        quantity : 5,
        price: 20
    },
    bread: {
        quantity : 2,
        price: 15
    },
    potato: {
        quantity : 3,
        price: 10
    }
}
```

I tried but I am getting only undefined output.
Want to get data such like :
```
['milk', 'bread', 'potato']

[20, 15, 10]
```
