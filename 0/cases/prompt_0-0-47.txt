how do you declare an array of objects inside typescript?

I would like to specify a function that takes an array of objects as a parameter, but I don't have a particular type defined for the object (a sort of "anonymous type")
```
bagTotal = (products) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

I understand I can do this:
```
bagTotal = (products: any[]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

but this is a bit more relaxed then what I want: to be strict with typescript.
`products` is an array of the same-looking objects; all objects have a name, a price and a description.
how can I declare that?
I want to do something like
```
bagTotal = (products: [{name: string, price: number, description: string}]) => {
 // function does stuff
}
```

but that's not right. How can I declare this?
