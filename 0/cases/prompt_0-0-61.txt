Change root background color with Material-UI theme

I'm trying something very simple: building two themes for a website using Material-UI themes:
A `light` theme and `dark` one, but it does not work well: the theme is on every Material-UI react element, but the root element on the html document keeps having the same default white background.
Of course it can be changed by attacking the body with pure .css:
```
body {
  background-color: #222;
}
```

But I was looking to change it dynamically with React, I though this would work, but it does not:
```
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@material-ui/styles';
import { MuiThemeProvider, createMuiTheme } from '@material-ui/core/styles';

const themeLight = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    background: {
      default: "#e4f0e2"
    }
  },
});

const themeDark = createMuiTheme({
  palette: {
    background: {
      default: "#222222",
    }
  },
});

ReactDOM.render(
  <MuiThemeProvider theme = { themeDark }>
    <App />
  </MuiThemeProvider>, document.getElementById('root'));
```

and I'm lost here, there is no way to make this with Material-UI theme?
