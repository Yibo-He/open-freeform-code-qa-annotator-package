How can I store and update multiple values in React useState?

I've a series of user data elements which I'm collecting inside a React component using hooks.

```
const [mobile, setMobile] = useState('');
const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
const [email, setEmail] = useState('');
const [password, setPassword] = useState('');
const [confirmPassword, setConfirmPassword] = useState('');
```


Each of these are updated as follows.

```
<input type="text"
       className="form-control"
       id="mobile"
       placeholder="Enter a valid mobile number"
       onChange={event => {setMobile(event.target.value)}}/>
```


Is there a more succint way to do this using an object as the variable?
