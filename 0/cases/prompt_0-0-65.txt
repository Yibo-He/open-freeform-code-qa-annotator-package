React Hooks: Why is .current null for useRef Hook?

I have a simple example of a component: 

```
function App() {
  const observed = useRef(null);
  console.log(observed.current);

  return (
    <div ref={observed} className="App">
      <h1>Hello CodeSandbox</h1>
      <h2>Start editing to see some magic happen!</h2>
    </div>
  );
}

const rootElement = document.getElementById("root");
ReactDOM.render(<App />, rootElement);
```


I would expect that `observed.current` would be of type element and current would not be empty but the div element with all its properties. My understanding would be:


1. The ref is initialised with a value of null
2. Null is overwritten by the ref



But as it turns out, `.current` remains empty. This is bad since I want to pass observed to a function that expects an argument of type Element.
