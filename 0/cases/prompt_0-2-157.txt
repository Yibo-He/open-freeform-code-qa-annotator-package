Vue 3 ::v-deep usage as a combinator has been deprecated. Use ::v-deep(<inner-selector>) instead

I started getting the following warning in Vue 3 with the `::v-deep` usage.
```
::v-deep usage as a combinator has been deprecated. Use ::v-deep(<inner-selector>) instead
```

The CSS looks like as follows:
```
.parent ::v-deep .child {
   ...
}
```

What's the correct way to use suggested option `::v-deep(<inner-selector>)`?
