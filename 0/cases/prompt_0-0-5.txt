Node.js: Python not found exception due to node-sass and node-gyp

Suddenly in one of my jenkins environment build has started failing, while in local machine it seems to be working fine as i have python installed,

From the logs i was able to detect that the problem is with internal dependency that is  from  when i researched by visiting [this](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp) about node-gyp and found the prerequisite that Python needs to be installed.

So my question is that what version of node-sass can i install to bypass this or is there a better solution as my build was running fine till this morning on the same environment.
