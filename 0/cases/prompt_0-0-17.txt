TipTap/VueJS - How to detect a keypress

I have a collaborative chat application that uses [tiptap](https://www.tiptap.dev/) for it's messaging area. I found it useful as it can support multiple formats already and can add some flexibility. However, I found myself stuck when looking for an event listener that listens for "enter" key. When the user hit the enter, I want to submit their chat and clear the editor.
I found this  event listener but I couldn't find exactly the place where it detects what key is pressed.
Sample code is below:
```
mounted() {
  let editor = new Editor({
    extensions: [StarterKit],
    content: this.value
  });

  editor.on("update", e => {
    console.log(e);
    this.$emit("input", this.editor.getHTML());
  });

  this.editor = editor;
}
```

I'm using Vue2, btw.
Thanks
