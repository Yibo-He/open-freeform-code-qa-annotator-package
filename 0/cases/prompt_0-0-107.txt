expo version command shows running scripts disabled on this machine

I am trying to develop a react native project in my Windows 10 machine. I installed node js then expo cli via visual studio code terminal. Then I tried the command `expo --version`, the terminal shows error::

```
expo : File C:\Users\saka\AppData\Roaming\npm\expo.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system. For more 
information, see about_Execution_Policies at https:/go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170.

+ expo --version
+ ~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : SecurityError: (:) [], PSSecurityException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : UnauthorizedAccess

the given link shows many things, but what shall I do to solve my problem? 
Thank You!!!
