How to use :not() in tailwind.css?

I recently started to give tailwind.css a try in my Nuxt project. so I needed to use `:not(:last-child)` pseudo-elements but I didn't find how.

```
<ul>
    <li
      v-for="(item, index) in items"
      :key="`item-${index}`"
      class="border-solid border-b border-black"
    >
      Item
    </li>
  </ul>
```


I want to add a border-bottom to all of the `<li>` except the last one.

I know Tailwind has [first](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants/#first-child-v1-1-0) & [last](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/pseudo-class-variants/#last-child-v1-1-0) pseudo-class variant but I can't use them with `:not()`
