React and Tailwind CSS: dynamically generated classes are not being applied

I'm just learning React and Tailwind CSS and had a strange experience with CSS grid using Tailwind classes. I've made the buttons for a calculator, with the last Button spanning two columns:

```
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="flex min-h-screen items-center justify-center bg-blue-400">
      <Calculator />
    </div>
  );
}
```


```
import { IoBackspaceOutline } from "react-icons/io5";

export const Calculator = () => {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-4 grid-rows-5 gap-2">
      <Button>AC</Button>
      <Button>
        <IoBackspaceOutline size={26} />
      </Button>
      <Button>%</Button>
      <Button>รท</Button>
      <Button>7</Button>
      <Button>8</Button>
      <Button>9</Button>
      <Button>x</Button>
      <Button>4</Button>
      <Button>5</Button>
      <Button>6</Button>
      <Button>-</Button>
      <Button>1</Button>
      <Button>2</Button>
      <Button>3</Button>
      <Button>+</Button>
      <Button>0</Button>
      <Button>.</Button>
      <Button colSpan={2}>=</Button>
    </div>
  );
};

const Button = ({ colSpan = 1, rowSpan = 1, children }) => {
  return (
    <div
      className={`col-span-${colSpan} row-span-${rowSpan} bg-white p-3 rounded`}
    >
      <div className="flex items-center justify-center">{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This doesn't work (tested in Chrome):

Now here comes the weird part. I replaced the returned JSX from the App component with HTML from a Tailwind tutorial and deleted it again.
```
<div className="bg-blue-400 text-blue-400 min-h-screen flex items-center justify-center">
  <div className="grid grid-cols-3 gap-2">
    <div className="col-span-2 bg-white p-10 rounded">1</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">2</div>
    <div className="row-span-3 bg-white p-10 rounded">3</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">4</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">5</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">6</div>
    <div className="col-span-2 bg-white p-10 rounded">7</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">8</div>
    <div className="bg-white p-10 rounded">9</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

After I Ctrl-Z'd a bunch of times, so I had only the previous code, my button suddenly spans two columns as intended:

I checked to make sure that there were no changes in the code:

My friend even cloned [my repo](https://github.com/asgervelling/col-span-bug/), followed the same steps and got the same result.
He suspects that it has something to do with the variable classNames in my Button component with regards to Tailwind's JIT compiler, but none of us can pinpoint the error.
Am I using variable CSS classes wrong?
This has been a WTF moment. What could be the reason for this?
