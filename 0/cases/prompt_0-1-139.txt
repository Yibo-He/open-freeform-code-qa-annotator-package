Tailwind CSS - Responsive breakpoints as components

How should I deal with responsive breakpoints as components in Tailwind?

Without Tailwind, I used to declare breakpoints as a scss mixins:

```
@mixin tablet-portrait {
  @media (min-width: 700px) {
    @content;
  }
}
```


Then:

```
@include tablet-portrait {
  // whatever
}
```


I know that Tailwind has responsive utility clases to use it inline as `md:color-red` but I need to abstract this breakpoins as components, as in above example.

How should I extract Tailwind breakpoints from Tailwind config file?
