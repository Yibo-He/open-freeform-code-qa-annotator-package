create-react-app Typescript 3.5, Path Alias

I am trying to setup Path alias in my project by adding these values to tsconfig.json:

```
"compilerOptions": {
    "baseUrl": "src",
    "paths": {
      "@store/*": ["store/*"]
    },
```


And if I create an import, neither IntelliJ or VSCode bother me:

```
import { AppState } from '@store/index';
```


But when I compile the application I get this warning:

```
The following changes are being made to your tsconfig.json file:
  - compilerOptions.paths must not be set (aliased imports are not supported)
```


And it bombs saying it cannot find the reference:

```
TypeScript error in C:/xyz.tsx(2,26):
Cannot find module '/store'.  TS2307
```


Is there any workaround or it is not supported by `create-react-app --typescript`?
