import error when using react-icons

I have tried installing react icons, in my application I ran the npm command:

```
sudo npm install react-icons --save
```


I didn't get any errors, apart from some optional dependencies, that where skipped

```
npm WARN optional SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: fsevents@1.2.4 
(node_modules/fsevents):
npm WARN notsup SKIPPING OPTIONAL DEPENDENCY: Unsupported platform for 
fsevents@1.2.4: wanted {"os":"darwin","arch":"any"} (current: 
{"os":"linux","arch":"x64"})
```


Whenever I try to import some of the icons, I get an error

```
./src/components/SkiDaysCount.js
Module not found: Can't resolve 'react-icons/lib/md' in ' 
'/home/kristoffer/ReactApps/navbar/src/components'
```


here are my imports:

```
import {Terrain} from 'react-icons/lib/md'
import {SnowFlake} from 'react-icons/lib/ti'
import {Calender} from 'react-icons/lib/fa'
```


Why am I getting this error?

EDIT:

i have also tried using the old syntax for importing, with the same issue as such:

```
import Calender from 'react-icons/lib/fa/calender'
```
