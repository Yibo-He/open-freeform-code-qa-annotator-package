React Navigation v5: How to get route params of the parent navigator inside the child screen

So I have nested navigators
Main BottomTab.Navigator
- - - - - - - - 
The problem is when I navigate from Profile View Screen to Following Navigator, I pass some parameters to the parent Following Navigator and I want all of those params in the children tabs Screens (Pages/Groups).
But the route of the children tab screens do not get the parameters which are passed to the parent navigator (Following Tab Navigator)
Is there a way to do that?
Here's my code:

```
const ProfileStack = () => (
  <Stack.Navigator
    initialRouteName='profileView'
  >
    <Stack.Screen
      name='profileView'
      component={ProfileScreen}
      options={{
        headerMode: 'screen',
        headerShown: false,
      }}
    />

    <Stack.Screen
      name='followers'
      component={FollowersScreen}
      options={{
        headerTitle: 'Followers',
      }}
    />
    <Stack.Screen
      name='following'
      component={FollowingTabs}
      options={{
        headerTitle: 'Following',
      }}
    />
 </Stack.Navigator>
```


```
const Tabs = createMaterialTopTabNavigator();
export const FollowingTabs = () => (
  <Tabs.Navigator
    initialRouteName='page'
    lazy
    swipeEnabled
  >
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={PageScreen}
      name='page'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '2 Pages' }}
    />
    <Tabs.Screen
      component={GroupScreen}
      name='groups'
      options={{ tabBarLabel: '3 Groups' }}
    />
  </Tabs.Navigator>
);
```

From the profileView Screen I'm trying to navigate to the following Tabs Screen and need to pass some parameters as follows.
```
const onPressHandler = () => {
    navigation.navigate('following', **{ isPublicProfile, firstName }**);  // These parameters are passed to the route of the following Tabs Navigator
  };
```

And when I try to read these parameters in children tabs (Pages/Groups) these are undefined
```
const PageScreen = ({ route }) => {
  const { isPublicProfile, firstName } = route.params; // undefined?? Can't read parent's params
...
```

Any help would be appreciated.
Edit: I found this open Issue on GitHub ([https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/issues/43](https://github.com/react-navigation/rfcs/issues/43)) Is this not possible yet?
