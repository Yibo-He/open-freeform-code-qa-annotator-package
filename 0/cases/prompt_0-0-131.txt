How to check if a value is not null and not empty string in JS

Is there any check if a value is not null and not empty string in Javascript? I'm using the following one:

```
var data; //get its value from db 
if(data != null && data != '') {
   // do something
}
```


But I'm wondering if there is another better solution. Thanks.
