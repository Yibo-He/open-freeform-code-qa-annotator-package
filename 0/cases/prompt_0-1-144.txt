Changing the color arrow in Bootstrap

I am beginner web developer. I have in my website accordion:  [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/accordion/)
and this code:
```
<div class="accordion pb-3" id="accordionExample">
                    <div class="accordion-item">
                        <h2 class="accordion-header" id="headingOne">
                            <button class="accordion-button" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#collapseOne" aria-expanded="true" aria-controls="collapseOne" style="background-color: red;border:0">
                                name and surname
                            </button>
                        </h2>
                        <div id="collapseOne" class="accordion-collapse collapse show" aria-labelledby="headingOne" data-bs-parent="#accordionExample" style="background-color: red;">
                            <div class="accordion-body">
                                This is aółóźńthe first item's accordion body.It is hidden by default, until the collapse plugin adds the appropriate classes that we use to style each element. These classes control the overall appearance, as well as the showing and hiding via CSS transitions. You can modify any of this with custom CSS or overriding our default variables. It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.
                            </div>
                        </div>
                    </div>
                </div>
```

It's work fine. I would like to change the accordion arrow color to green. How can this be done?
Please help me
