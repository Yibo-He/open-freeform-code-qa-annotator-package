Reset to Initial State with React Hooks

I'm currently working on a signup form and the following is a snippet of my code:

```
const Signup = () => {
    const [username, setUsername] = useState('')
    const [email, setEmail] = useState('')
    const [password, setPassword] = useState('')
    const [passwordConfirmation, setPasswordConfirmation] = useState('')

    const clearState = () => {
        setUsername('')
        setEmail('')
        setPassword('')
        setPasswordConfirmation('')
    }

    const handleSubmit = signupUser => e => {
        e.preventDefault()
        signupUser().then(data => {
            console.log(data)
            clearState() // <-----------
        })
    }

    return <JSX />
}

export default Signup
```


Each piece of state is used for a controlled input for the form.

Essentially what I want to do is after the user has successfully signed up, I want the state to go back to the initial state with the fields cleared.

It's quite imperative to manually set each piece of state back to empty strings in`clearState` I was wondering if there is a method or function that comes with React that resets the state back to its initial values?
