Which Enzyme adapter works with React 17?

I have a React app, and I want to start writing unit tests with Enzyme. Enzyme's [documentation](https://enzymejs.github.io/enzyme/) discusses versions of React up to 16.
In `src/setupTests.js` I currently have
```
import Enzyme from 'enzyme';
import Adapter from 'enzyme-adapter-react-16';

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() });
```

But my app uses React version 17.0.1.
