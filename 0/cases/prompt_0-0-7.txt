Angular typescript convert string to number

I want to convert a `string number` (an integer represented as a string. ex "12" ) to a `number`

```
export class Person{
  FirstName :  string | undefined ;
  Telephone:  number | undefined ;

}
```


```
console.log("Person" + JSON.stringify(this.person));
```

The JSON appears as
```
{
    "FirstName ": "hhhhh",
    "Telephone": "1478525",
}
```

The Telephone property is a number and I want it to appear as follows (without the ""_ :
```
{
    "FirstName ": "hhhhh",
    "Telephone": 1478525,
}
```

Approaches I took.
```
this.person.Telephone = parseInt(telephone);
```

Above didn't work, it shows the same number enclosed as a `string`. I also tried the following:
```
this.person.Telephone as number
```

both approaches didn't work. Can someone help me solve this ?
Error I get if I don't convert to a number:
> "The JSON value could not be converted to System.Int32. Path:
$.Telephone | LineNumber: 2 | BytePositionInLine: 18."
