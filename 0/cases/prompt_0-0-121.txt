Vue Uncaught ReferenceError: process is not defined

I'm working on a `Vue + typescript` project. I want to use `process.env.var_name` to adjust the project is in development mode or production mode, just like
```
const isProduct = process.env.APP_ENV === "prod";
```

; however I got an error below. I never meet this error before, so could any one give me a clue why this would happen so I can try to figure out what happend in the project and then fix it.[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/VEk1H.png)
