How to make select dropdown readonly or disabled conditionally in angular?

I am using Angular7 and I want to make select element readonly or disabled conditionnaly.



```
editable: boolean = true;
```


And the template:

```
<select  #listOfOptions="ngModel" [(ngModel)]="myList" [readonly]="!editable" class="form-control">
    </select>
```


This causes:

> Error: Template parse errors:
      Can't bind to 'readOnly' since it isn't a known property of 'select'.

There is an [issue](https://github.com/ng-select/ng-select/issues/786) about this, no solutions yet!



```
<select [attr.disabled]="!editable">
...
</select>
```


It is always disabled, no matter how I set the editable variable.

Thank you for help.
