Can't connect to Elasticsearch with Node.Js on Kubernetes (self signed certificate in certificate chain)

I have a NodeJs application running inside a Kubernetes cluster (I am using [microk8s](https://microk8s.io/)). I've also followed the [official steps](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/cloud-on-k8s/current/k8s-quickstart.html) to setup Elasticsearch on Kubernetes.

# Issue


But I am unable to connect to the Elasticsearch cluster. I get this error:
```
ConnectionError: self signed certificate in certificate chain
```

This is a [code snippet](https://github.com/flolu/elasticsearch-k8s-connection/blob/e5c321d7727dc026ec1af14a7dcea44a1874d14b/search/index.ts#L4) of my connection:
```
const client = new elasticsearch.Client({
  node: process.env.elasticsearch_node,
  // https://elasticsearch-es-http.default.svc.cluster.local:9200
});
```


# Minimal reproduction


I've created a minimal reproduction of this issue here: [https://github.com/flolu/elasticsearch-k8s-connection](https://github.com/flolu/elasticsearch-k8s-connection). (Setup instructions are in the README)
Basically, everything works fine when running Elasticsearch inside Docker compose, but I can't connect when running inside Kubernetes.
The reason for this is probably because I didn't setup TLS certificates correctly, but I haven't found any information about it.
