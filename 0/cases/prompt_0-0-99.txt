Angular 5 Validators.pattern regex for only numbers

I'm having trouble getting the Angular 5 Validators.pattern to work. I've tried every regex that SHOULD normally work, but it's not working. I read that Validators.pattern requires a different format, but I can't seem to find it...

Any ideas what the Validators.pattern should be to

(1) allow only numbers, positive and negative

and 

(2) allow only numbers, positive and negative, optionally with up to 2 decimal places

Valid examples would be: 
1
1.2
1.22
-21
-21.48

Anything with any letter in it would be invalid.

Thanks for your help!
