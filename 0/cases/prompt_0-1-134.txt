How to quickly create <div> classes in VSCode

Generally new to web design and watching some tutorials on creating some backend for a project, getting really tired of writing out the  manually, I see youtubers do .classname and then the class with the div appears, but for some reason it isn't working for me? Any help would be appreciated.

Also, would it be easier to switch to Sublime, my buddies think that it is the way to go.

Cheers.
