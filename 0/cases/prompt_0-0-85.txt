How can I set a primary color in Chakra UI theme?

I want to set the primary and secondary color in my theme.js/theme.ts. Is there any way to do that?
I am used to work with Material UI components in my React projects.
It is possible to set a palette with 'primary' and 'secondary' there.
I mean something like this:
```
export const theme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    primary: {
      main: "#7bb9e8"
    },
    secondary: {
      main: "#eb7f7f"
    }
  }
})
```
