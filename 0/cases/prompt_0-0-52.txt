How to remove package using Angular CLI?

Angular 6 has new CLI command `ng add <package>`.

How can I remove the package using Angular CLI?

UPDATE

[documentation](https://blog.angular.io/version-6-of-angular-now-available-cc56b0efa7a4)

> `ng add` will use your package manager to download new dependencies and invoke an installation script (implemented as a schematic) which can update your project with configuration changes, add additional dependencies (e.g. polyfills), or scaffold package-specific initialization code

It is not the same `npm install <package>`

I was trying to use `ng rm` but it is not working yet.
