Defining multiple mapped types in typescript?

Say I have the following typescript code:
```
type fruit = "apple" | "banana" | "pear"
type color = "red" | "yellow" | "green"
```

And I want to create a type that has a numeric property for each fruit and a boolean property for each color, something like
```
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
  [key in color]: boolean
}
```

Unfortunately, this errors with the message "A mapped type may not declare properties or methods", yet it compiles fine. What's actually happening here?
I can get around this with something like
```
type FruitsAndColors = {
  [key in fruit]: number;
} & {
  [key in color]: boolean
}
```

But I'd like to know what the actual issue is.
