How to access all the direct children of a div in tailwindcss?

I have this html:
```
<div class="section">
   <div class="header">header</div>
   <div class="content">
      <div>sub contents 1</div>              
      <div>sub contents 2</div>
   </div>
</div>
```

I want to access the direct children of div with class "section" which would be divs with class: "header" and "content".
I know with css we can do: `div.section > div`
But how to do this using ?
