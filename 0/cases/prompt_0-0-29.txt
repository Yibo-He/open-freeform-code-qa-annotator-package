Chain 2 queries in RTK Query

What is the proper way to chain queries if the 2nd query requires a parameter that is returned by the 1st?
```
const { data: user } = useGetUserQuery();
```

The user object contains an ID that is used to run
```
const { data: userBio} = useGetUserBioQuery(user.id);
```

How do I make sure the 2nd one runs only after the 1st one is fulfilled?
