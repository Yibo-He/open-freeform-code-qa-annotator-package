NextJS deployed to Vercel: 404 page not found

I have a NextJS app without an integrated api that I want to deploy to Vercel. It works fine when I run it locally `yarn run dev` and I can also build it `yarn run build` without any errors. When I deploy it Vercel, however, I receive a `404 Error`.
Here is my folder structure:
```
app/
  - components
  - pages
    - editor
      - [id].tsx
    ...tsx
  - public
  - utils
    - db
      api.ts
```

I am using NextJs 10.0.3.
Here is a link to the deployed [app](https://clubhouse-bio-2qgg4rvij.vercel.app).
I don't have a nextjs config file. My assumption is that the error is caused by the dynamic route but I can't find my mistake. Also, no page is working when the app is deployed as opposed to only the dynamic page.
Do you have pointers on where to look next?

EDIT 2:
I found an issue but don't know how to fix it.
This is how my build output looks like on Vercel:

This is how it's supposed to look like on Vercel:

Not sure why the whole `_next` folder is missing.
