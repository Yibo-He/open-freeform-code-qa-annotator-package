unsafe:data:image/jpeg;base64, net::ERR_UNKNOWN_URL_SCHEME in Angular 7

I am getting image as base64 blob from a service and I am binding into
view. But I am facing an issue. How can I sanitize the url into a
trusted url. I have tried with sanitizer but no luck..
Please help me out..

```
<img src="data:image/jpeg;base64,{{inspectionDetails.reportImage}}" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Image" />
```


```
this.ImgUrl = this.inspectionDetails.reportImage;
this.base64Image = this._sanitizer.bypassSecurityTrustResourceUrl(this.ImgUrl);
```
