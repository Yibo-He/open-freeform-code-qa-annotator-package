Font Awesome 5 font-family issue

I integrated Font Awesome 5 in a project with bootstrap 4. When I recall a font via CSS it does not work.
with Font Awesome 4 the code was as follows:

```
#mainNav .navbar-collapse .navbar-sidenav .nav-link-collapse:after {
  float: right;
  content: "\f107";
  font-family: "FontAwesome";
}
```


I tried to change the font name but it does not work

```
font-family: 'Font Awesome 5 Free'
```
