Trigger client-side reload in next.js


# Scenario



The index page uses "getInitialProps" to load data. Then we create a dialog which can create a new data. After creating a new data, the current page should be reloaded.


# Problem



We use `Router.replace('/')` to reload the page. But it triggers a server-side rendering.


# Question



What we need is a client-side reload. The "getInitialProps" function should be called in the browser. So, how to do the client-side reload?
