Parse JSON with undefined value?

>  [Parsing or fixing JSONs with special 'undefined' values?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59304404/parsing-or-fixing-jsons-with-special-undefined-value/)

I would like to know if it's possible to parse something like`javascript JSON.parse('{ "name": undefined}');`
generated by the API?

The above code errors. 

Is there some way of parsing it? - my actual example is  longer (see [here](https://pastebin.com/98KGhTmf)), I just use the very short example for illustrative purposes
