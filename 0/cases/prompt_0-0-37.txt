how to use optional url parameters with NestjS

I'm trying to replace our current backend service using Nestjs library, 
however, I want to create a route with 2 optional parameters in the URL something like : 

`/route/:param1/config/:OptionalParam3?/:OptionalParam3?` 

that means the route should catch : 


1. route/aa/config
2. route/aa/config/bb
3. route/aa/config/bb/cc



how can I achieve that, I have tried to use `?` and `()` but it's not working well.
