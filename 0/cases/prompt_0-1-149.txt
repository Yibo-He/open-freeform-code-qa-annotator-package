Tailwind underline hover animation

I've spent a day figuring out how to make an animation after hovering over the link by using Tailwind-CSS.
Here is the animation I want mine link looks like the video.

I have tried using `:after`, but it didn't work out.
Here is my link component => [https://codepen.io/qqharry21/pen/xxPwqjQ](https://codepen.io/qqharry21/pen/xxPwqjQ)
