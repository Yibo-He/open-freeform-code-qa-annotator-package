Dynamically change background color on scroll

Is there any way to change background color dynamically on scroll?

For example, refer this site([https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/](https://www.samsung.com/sec/smartphones/galaxy-note9/))

When you first access that site, background color is blue.

While scroll down, it's color change to black smoothly.

Also see this site(`codepen.io/Funsella/pen/yLfAG/`)

Second site is same with first. But it's color changed at once.

But first site's color is not change at once.

It changed gradually related to scroll position.

```
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
.section1 {
  background-color: white;
  height: 100%;
}
.section2 {
  background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654);
  height: 100%;
}
```
```
<html>
<body>
  <section class="section1">
    SECTION1
  </section>
  <section class="section2">
    SECTION2
  </section>
</body>
</html>
```



Above code is what I'm worked on.

Current it's color is split by each section.

When I scroll down, I want to change color `background-color: white` -> `background: linear-gradient(#f05fa6, #ed1654)`

Is there any solution about this?
