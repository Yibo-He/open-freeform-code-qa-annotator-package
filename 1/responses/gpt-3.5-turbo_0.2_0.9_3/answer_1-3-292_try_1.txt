Yes, there are several ways to extract the star logo from the image. One of the simplest methods is to use a thresholding technique. Here are the steps:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Apply a threshold to the grayscale image to create a binary image where the star logo is white and the background is black.
3. Use a morphological operation, such as erosion or dilation, to remove any small noise or gaps in the binary image.
4. Use a contour detection algorithm to find the contour of the star logo in the binary image.
5. Extract the region of interest (ROI) corresponding to the contour of the star logo from the original image.

Here's some sample code in Python using OpenCV library:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.png')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply threshold
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Remove noise and gaps
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (5, 5))
thresh = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_CLOSE, kernel)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Extract ROI
x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(contours[0])
roi = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('ROI', roi)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

This code should extract the star logo from the image and display it in a new window. You can adjust the threshold value and the morphological operation parameters to get better results for different images.
