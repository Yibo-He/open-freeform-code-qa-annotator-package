Yes, you can use the `boto3` library to get a list of all the resources in your AWS account. Here's an example code snippet that you can use:

```python
import boto3

# Create a session using your AWS credentials
session = boto3.Session(
    aws_access_key_id='YOUR_ACCESS_KEY',
    aws_secret_access_key='YOUR_SECRET_KEY',
    region_name='YOUR_REGION'
)

# Create a client for each service you want to list resources for
ec2_client = session.client('ec2')
s3_client = session.client('s3')
rds_client = session.client('rds')

# Get a list of all resources for each service
ec2_resources = ec2_client.describe_instances()
s3_resources = s3_client.list_buckets()
rds_resources = rds_client.describe_db_instances()

# Print the results
print(ec2_resources)
print(s3_resources)
print(rds_resources)
```

This code creates a session using your AWS credentials, and then creates a client for each service you want to list resources for (in this example, EC2, S3, and RDS). You can add more clients for other services as needed.

Once you have the clients, you can use the appropriate `describe` or `list` function to get a list of all the resources for each service. The results will be returned as a dictionary, which you can then print or process as needed.
