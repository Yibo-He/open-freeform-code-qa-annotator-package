It seems like the issue is related to the timezone information in your datetime objects. Excel does not support timezone-aware datetimes, so you need to convert them to timezone-naive datetimes before writing to Excel.

Here's a possible solution:

```
# Convert datetime columns to timezone-naive datetimes
df['datetime_column'] = df['datetime_column'].dt.tz_localize(None)

# Write to Excel
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(arquivo+'.xlsx', engine='xlsxwriter', options={'remove_timezone': True})
df.to_excel(writer, header=True, index=True)
```

This code uses the `dt.tz_localize(None)` method to convert the datetime column to timezone-naive datetimes. This should remove the timezone information and allow you to write to Excel without errors.

Make sure to apply this conversion to all datetime columns in your DataFrame before writing to Excel.
