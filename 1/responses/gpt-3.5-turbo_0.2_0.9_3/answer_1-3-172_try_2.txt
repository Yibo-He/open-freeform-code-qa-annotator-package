You can use the `forestplot` function from the `pyforestplot` package to create a forest plot in Python. Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import pyforestplot as pfp

# create a dataframe with the data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'study': ['Study 1', 'Study 2', 'Study 3'],
    'rr': [1.23, 0.98, 1.56],
    'ci_l': [0.87, 0.65, 1.12],
    'ci_u': [1.74, 1.32, 2.01],
    'weight': [0.25, 0.35, 0.4]
})

# create the forest plot
pfp.forestplot(data, x='rr', ci_l='ci_l', ci_u='ci_u', weight='weight', study_id='study')
```

This will create a forest plot with the risk ratios (`rr`) and confidence intervals (`ci_l` and `ci_u`) for each study, as well as the study weights (`weight`). The `study` column is used as the study identifier. You can customize the appearance of the plot using the various options available in the `forestplot` function.
