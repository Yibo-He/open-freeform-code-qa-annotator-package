`random_state` is a parameter in the `train_test_split` function that allows you to specify the random seed used by the random number generator. This is important because when you split your data into training and testing sets, you want to ensure that the same split is obtained every time you run your code. 

By setting `random_state` to a specific value (in this case, 42), you are ensuring that the same random split is obtained every time you run the code. This is useful for reproducibility and for comparing results across different runs of the code.

The value 42 is often used as a default value for `random_state` in examples and tutorials because it is a reference to the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, in which the number 42 is famously described as the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything". However, in practice, any integer value can be used for `random_state`.
