The issue with your code is that `rename()` method does not have a `columns` parameter. Instead, you can use the `index` parameter to rename the column name of the resulting DataFrame. Here's the corrected code:

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename(index={"p":"mean"})
```

This should rename the blank column created by the "mean" call to "mean".
