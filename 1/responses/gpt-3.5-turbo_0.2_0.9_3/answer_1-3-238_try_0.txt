The error message you are getting is related to the `reverse` function in Django. It seems that you are trying to reverse a URL pattern that does not exist. 

Based on the traceback, the error is happening in the `base.html` template, specifically in line 10 where you are loading the `bootstrap.min.css` file from a CDN. 

To fix this issue, you can try replacing the `link` tag in line 10 with the following code:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/bootstrap.min.css' %}">
```

This will load the `bootstrap.min.css` file from your static files directory instead of a CDN. 

After making this change, try running your project again and see if the issue is resolved.
