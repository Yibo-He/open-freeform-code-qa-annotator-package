The error message suggests that there is a problem with the CMake installation. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install CMake using apt-get:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

2. Try installing OpenCV again using pip:
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```

If the above steps do not work, you can try building OpenCV from source inside the docker container. Here are the steps to build OpenCV from source:

1. Install the required dependencies:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
```

2. Clone the OpenCV repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
cd opencv
git checkout 4.4.0
```

3. Create a build directory and run CMake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

4. Build and install OpenCV:
```
make -j4
sudo make install
```

After the installation is complete, you can verify that OpenCV is installed by running the following command:
```
python3 -c "import cv2; print(cv2.__version__)"
```
