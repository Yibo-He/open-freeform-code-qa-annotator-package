This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary location is not set or cannot be found. You can try specifying the path to the Firefox binary using the `executable_path` parameter when creating the `webdriver.Firefox()` instance. Here's an example:

```
from selenium import webdriver
browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/firefox/binary')
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary on your system. If you don't know the path, you can try searching for it or installing Firefox if it's not already installed.
