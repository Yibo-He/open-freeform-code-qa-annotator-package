This is actually intended behavior. When you use double square brackets `[[ ]]` to select a column, you are creating a DataFrame with a single column. On the other hand, when you use single square brackets `[ ]`, you are creating a Pandas Series.

When you assign a Pandas Series to a DataFrame column, the values are aligned based on the index of the Series and the DataFrame. In your first example, you are assigning a DataFrame with a single column to another DataFrame column. Since the index of the two DataFrames are different, Pandas cannot align the values and assigns NaN to all the rows.

In your second example, you are assigning a Pandas Series to a DataFrame column. Since both have the same index, the values are aligned correctly and you get the expected result.

So, to summarize, if you want to assign a single column of a DataFrame to another column, use single square brackets `[ ]`. If you want to assign a DataFrame with a single column to another column, use double square brackets `[[ ]]`.
