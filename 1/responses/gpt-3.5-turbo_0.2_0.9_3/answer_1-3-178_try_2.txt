To select an option from a dropdown list using Playwright for Python, you can use the `selectOption` method on the `handle` object that represents the `<select>` element. Here's an example that selects the "Banana" option:

```
from playwright import sync_playwright

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # Wait for the select element to appear
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)
    select_element = page.querySelector(new_selector)

    # Select the "Banana" option
    select_element.selectOption("text=Banana")
```

Note that the `selectOption` method takes a selector that identifies the option to select. In this case, we're using the `text` selector to select the option with the text "Banana". You can also use other selectors like `value` or `index` to select an option based on its value or index in the list.
