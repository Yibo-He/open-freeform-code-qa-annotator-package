If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out, it means that it is being overridden by another setting. You can try adding the following line to your settings.json file to completely disable Jedi:

```
"python.jediEnabled": false
```

If that doesn't work, you can try disabling Jedi in your virtual environment by adding the following line to your activate script:

```
export JEDI_SKIP_LOOKUP="true"
```

If you're using a conda environment, you can disable Jedi by running the following command:

```
conda config --set jedi_enabled false
```

After making any changes, be sure to restart your editor for the changes to take effect.
