One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which can be useful when you have two infinite loops that need to run simultaneously.

Here's an example of how you can use multiprocessing to run both scripts simultaneously:

```
import multiprocessing
import financeData as fd
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import homePage as hp
import dataBase as db

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a new process for the data mining script
    data_mining_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=fd.financeData, args=(db.dataBase(), 1600))
    data_mining_process.start()

    # Run the dash app in the main process
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database = db.dataBase()
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

    # Wait for the data mining process to finish
    data_mining_process.join()
```

In this example, we create a new process for the data mining script using the `multiprocessing.Process` class. We pass the `target` argument as the `financeData` function and the `args` argument as a tuple containing the database and the refresh rate.

We then start the data mining process using the `start` method.

In the main process, we run the dash app as usual. Once the app is running, we wait for the data mining process to finish using the `join` method.

This way, both scripts can run simultaneously without interfering with each other.
