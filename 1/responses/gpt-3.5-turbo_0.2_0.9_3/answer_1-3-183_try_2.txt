To get the boundary of the rectangle, you can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage` library. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from skimage import measure

# assuming your binary mask is stored in the variable 'mask'
contours = measure.find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# the 'contours' variable now contains a list of arrays, where each array
# represents the x-y coordinates of a single contour
# in this case, there should only be one contour (the boundary of the rectangle)
boundary_coords = contours[0]

# plot the boundary
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(boundary_coords[:, 1], boundary_coords[:, 0])
plt.show()
```

This should give you the desired output, which is the boundary of the rectangle:
