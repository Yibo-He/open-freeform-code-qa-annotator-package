It sounds like you may need to activate the new environment before launching Jupyter Lab. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Create a new Conda environment using `conda create --name myenv`.
2. Activate the new environment using `conda activate myenv`.
3. Install `nb_conda_kernels` in the new environment using `conda install nb_conda_kernels`.
4. Launch Jupyter Lab from the new environment using `jupyter lab`.
5. In Jupyter Lab, go to the "Kernel" menu and select "Change Kernel". You should see the new environment listed as an available kernel.

If you want to launch Jupyter Lab from your base environment and still be able to use the new environment as a kernel, you can try installing `nb_conda_kernels` in your base environment as well. Then, when you launch Jupyter Lab from the base environment, you should be able to see all available kernels, including those from other environments.

If this doesn't work, you can try updating your Jupyter Lab installation using `conda update jupyterlab`. Sometimes, outdated versions of Jupyter Lab can cause issues with kernel management.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
