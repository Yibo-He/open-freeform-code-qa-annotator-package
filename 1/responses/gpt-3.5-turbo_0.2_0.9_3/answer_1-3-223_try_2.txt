You can use the `pip` module in Python to check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in a script and return a true or false. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import pip

def is_latest_version(package_name):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    for package in package_info:
        if package.key == package_name:
            # Check if the package is at its latest version
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(package_name)
            if package.version == latest_version:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    # If the package is not installed, return False
    return False
```

You can call this function with the name of the package you want to check, like this:

```
package_name = 'gekko'
is_latest = is_latest_version(package_name)
print(is_latest)
```

This will print `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.
