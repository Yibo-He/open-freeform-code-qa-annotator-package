This error message indicates that there is an issue with loading the `asmjit.dll` file or one of its dependencies. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check if your system meets the PyTorch installation requirements. PyTorch requires a 64-bit version of Python 3.6, 3.7, or 3.8, and a compatible version of CUDA if you plan to use GPU acceleration.

2. Try reinstalling PyTorch using the following command:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```
This command installs the latest version of PyTorch along with its dependencies.

3. Check if the `asmjit.dll` file is present in the `C:\Users\chunc\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\torch\lib` directory. If it is missing, try reinstalling PyTorch as mentioned in step 2.

4. Check if the `asmjit.dll` file is being blocked by your antivirus software. If so, try disabling the antivirus temporarily and then reinstall PyTorch.

5. Try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019. You can download it from the Microsoft website.

6. If none of the above steps work, try installing PyTorch using the pip package manager instead of conda. You can use the following command:
```
pip install torch torchvision torchaudio
```

I hope one of these steps helps you resolve the issue and use PyTorch successfully.
