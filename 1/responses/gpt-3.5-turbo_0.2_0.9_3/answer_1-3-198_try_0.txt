To read a CSV file from Google Drive in pandas, you need to get the shareable link of the file and modify it to get the direct download link. Here's how you can do it:

1. Get the shareable link of the CSV file from Google Drive. It should look something like this: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`, where `FILE_ID` is the unique identifier of the file.

2. Modify the link to get the direct download link. Replace `/view?usp=sharing` with `&export=download`. The modified link should look something like this: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download`.

3. Use the modified link to read the CSV file in pandas using the `read_csv()` function. Here's an example:

```
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Replace `FILE_ID` with the unique identifier of your CSV file.

Note that if the CSV file is not publicly shared, you may need to authenticate with Google Drive to access it. You can use the `gdown` package to download the file and then read it in pandas. Here's an example:

```
!pip install gdown

import pandas as pd
import gdown

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID'
output = 'data.csv'
gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)

df = pd.read_csv(output)
```

Replace `FILE_ID` with the unique identifier of your CSV file. The `gdown.download()` function will prompt you to authenticate with Google Drive if necessary.
