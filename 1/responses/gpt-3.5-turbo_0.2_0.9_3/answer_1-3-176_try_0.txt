The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for installing Pillow. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install zlib development package: On Windows, you can download and install the pre-built zlib library from the GnuWin32 project website. Make sure to download the development package that includes the header files. On Linux, you can install the zlib development package using the package manager of your distribution.

2. Set the zlib path: After installing the zlib development package, you need to set the path to the zlib library and header files. On Windows, you can set the environment variable `ZLIB_ROOT` to the installation directory of zlib. On Linux, you can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable to the directory containing the zlib library.

3. Re-run the installation: Once you have set the zlib path, you can re-run the installation of Pillow using `pip install pillow`.

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow using a pre-built binary wheel for your platform. You can download the wheel file from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and install it using `pip install <wheel-file>` command.
