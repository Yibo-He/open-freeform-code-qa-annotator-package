You can achieve this by using `groupby` on column A and then applying `idxmin` on column B to get the index of the row with the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use `loc` to select the rows with those indices:
```
df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```
This will give you the desired output:
```
A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```
