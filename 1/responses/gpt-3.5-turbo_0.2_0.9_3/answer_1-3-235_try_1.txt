The error message suggests that there is at least one value in the `year` column that is not a valid integer. In this case, it seems that the value is '2021.0', which cannot be converted to an integer.

To fix this issue, you can try converting the column to float first and then to integer. This will allow the decimal values to be preserved and avoid the error message.

Here is an updated code snippet:

```
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
```

This should convert the `year` column to integer format without any errors.
