One possible solution to speed up reading multiple pickle files is to use the `pandas` library. You can create a list of file paths and then use the `pandas.read_pickle()` function to read them all into a single `pandas.Series` object. This will be faster than reading them in a loop because `pandas` uses optimized C code to read the files.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

file_paths = ['file1.pkl', 'file2.pkl', 'file3.pkl']
series_list = []

for file_path in file_paths:
    series_list.append(pd.read_pickle(file_path))

combined_series = pd.concat(series_list)
```

This code will read all the pickle files in `file_paths` into a list of `pandas.Series` objects, and then combine them into a single `pandas.Series` object using the `pd.concat()` function. This should be faster than reading the files in a loop because `pandas` uses optimized C code to read the files.
