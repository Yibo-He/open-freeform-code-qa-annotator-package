Yes, you can use a loop to replace the same string in all the elements of the list. Here's an example code:

```
list_names = ['!sdf?', '!sdfds?', '!afsafsa?', '!afasf?']

for i in range(len(list_names)):
    list_names[i] = list_names[i].replace('!', '').replace('?', '')

print(list_names)
```

This code will replace all occurrences of '!' and '?' in each element of the list with an empty string. The loop iterates over the indices of the list, and the `replace()` method is called on each element using the index. The modified list is printed at the end.
