The error message suggests that the `profile` URL pattern is not able to match the argument passed to it. Looking at your `urls.py` file, the `profile` URL pattern expects a string argument named `name`. However, in your `index.html` file, you are passing `post.author.username` as the argument to the `profile` URL. 

It's possible that `post.author.username` is empty or None, which is causing the error. To fix this, you can add a check to make sure that `post.author.username` is not empty before passing it to the `profile` URL. 

For example, you can modify the relevant part of your `index.html` file as follows:

```
{% if post.author.username %}
    <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
        @{{post.author.username}}
    </a>
{% endif %}
```

This will only generate the link if `post.author.username` is not empty.
