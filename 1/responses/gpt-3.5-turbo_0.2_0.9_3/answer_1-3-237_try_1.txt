To write test cases for this function, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a test case function that calls `myfunc` with a link and checks if the expected value is added to the list.

2. Create a list of links and expected values that you want to test.

3. Loop through the list of links and expected values, and call the test case function for each link.

Here's an example implementation:

```
def test_myfunc():
    link = "https://example.com"
    myfunc(link)
    assert "expected_value" in list

links_and_values = [
    ("https://example.com", "expected_value_1"),
    ("https://example.org", "expected_value_2"),
    ("https://example.net", "expected_value_3"),
]

for link, expected_value in links_and_values:
    test_myfunc(link, expected_value)
```

In this example, the `test_myfunc` function calls `myfunc` with a link and checks if the expected value is added to the list. The `links_and_values` list contains the links and expected values that we want to test. We loop through this list and call the `test_myfunc` function for each link. If the expected value is not added to the list, the test will fail.
