You can use the PyTorch `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import torch

# create the tensors
inps = torch.randn(64, 161, 1)
d = torch.randn(64, 161)

# add a new dimension to d
d = d.unsqueeze(-1)

# concatenate the tensors along the last dimension
out = torch.cat([inps, d], dim=-1)

# print the output size
print(out.size())  # should be [64, 161, 2]
```

In this code, we first add a new dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze()` function so that it has the same number of dimensions as `inps`. Then, we use `torch.cat()` to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension (`dim=-1`). The resulting tensor `out` has a size of `[64, 161, 2]`.
