The error message suggests that there is a value in the `year` column that is not a valid integer. In this case, it seems like there is a value of '2021.0' which cannot be converted to an integer.

To fix this issue, you can try converting the column to float first and then to integer. This will handle the case where there are decimal values in the column.

Here is the updated code:

```
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
```

This should convert the `year` column to integer format without any errors.
