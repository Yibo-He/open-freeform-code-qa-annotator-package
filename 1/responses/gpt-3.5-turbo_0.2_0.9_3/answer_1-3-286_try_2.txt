The issue with your code is that you are trying to access the variable `a` outside of the `try` block. If the user inputs a string, the `try` block will fail and `a` will not be defined, causing a `NameError` when you try to check if `a == "Done"` in the `except` block.

To fix this, you can move the `if a == "Done":` check inside the `try` block, and use a `break` statement to exit the loop when the user inputs "Done". Here's the updated code:

```
s = set()
print('Please type the number, when you are done please type "Done":')
while True:
    try:
        a = input()
        if a == "Done":
            break
        s.add(int(a))
    except ValueError:
        print('Integer only, please re-type:')
        continue
print(s)
```

In this version, we first read the user input as a string using `input()`, and then check if it's equal to "Done" inside the `try` block. If it is, we use `break` to exit the loop. If it's not, we try to convert it to an integer using `int(a)` and add it to the set. If the conversion fails (i.e., the user input is not a valid integer), we catch the `ValueError` exception and ask the user to re-type.
