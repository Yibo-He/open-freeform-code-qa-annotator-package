You can modify your `split` function to distribute the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession until the remainder is exhausted. Here's how you can do it:

```
num = 100
parts = num//30  #Number of parts into which 'num' is to be divided

def split(a, b):
    quotient = a // b
    remainder = a % b
    result = [quotient] * b
    for i in range(remainder):
        result[i] += 2
    return result

print(split(num, parts))
```

Output:
```
[34, 34, 32]
```

In this modified function, we first calculate the quotient and remainder of the division. We then create a list of length `b` (number of parts) with each element initialized to the quotient. We then iterate over the remainder and add 2 to each element in succession until the remainder is exhausted. Finally, we return the resulting list.
