You can use the `applymap()` method to apply a function to each element of the dataframe. Here's an example code snippet that should achieve what you're looking for:

```
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will apply the lambda function to each element of the dataframe and replace values greater than or equal to 25 with 1, and all other values with 0.
