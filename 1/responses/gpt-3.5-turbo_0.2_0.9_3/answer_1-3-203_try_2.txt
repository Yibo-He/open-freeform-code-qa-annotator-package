It's possible that the slow performance is due to compatibility issues with the M1 Max chip. Some libraries may not have been optimized for this architecture yet. 

Here are some suggestions that may help improve performance:

1. Use the latest version of Python that is optimized for the M1 chip. You can download it from the official Python website.

2. Use the latest version of NumPy that is optimized for the M1 chip. You can install it using `pip install numpy`.

3. Use TensorFlow with Metal support. This can be installed using `pip install tensorflow-metal`.

4. Use PyTorch with Metal support. This can be installed using `pip install torch-macos`.

5. Use a code editor that is optimized for the M1 chip, such as Visual Studio Code or PyCharm.

6. Use the latest version of macOS and keep your system updated.

7. If possible, try running your code on a cloud-based service that provides M1 Max instances, such as AWS or Google Cloud.

I hope these suggestions help improve your performance.
