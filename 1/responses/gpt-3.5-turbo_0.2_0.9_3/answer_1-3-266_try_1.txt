It seems like your static files are not being served correctly. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if your static files are being collected correctly by running the `collectstatic` command again and verifying that the files are being copied to the correct location. You can also check the logs to see if there were any errors during the collection process.

2. Check if your static files are being served correctly by adding the following lines to your `urls.py` file:

```
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... your URL patterns here ...
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
```

This will serve your static files from the `STATIC_ROOT` directory when `DEBUG` is set to `True`.

3. If you are using a production server, make sure that your server is configured to serve static files correctly. For example, if you are using Apache, you will need to configure the `Alias` and `Directory` directives to point to your static files directory.

4. Make sure that your static files are accessible from the URL specified in your `STATIC_URL` setting. For example, if your `STATIC_URL` is set to `/static/`, make sure that your static files are accessible at `http://yourdomain.com/static/`.

5. Check if your static files are being cached by your browser. Try clearing your browser cache or accessing your website in incognito mode.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
