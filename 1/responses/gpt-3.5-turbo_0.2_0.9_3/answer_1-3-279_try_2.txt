The error message indicates that the user running the Django application does not have permission to create the `/media/artists` directory. You can fix this issue by changing the ownership of the `/media` directory to the user running the Django application.

You can use the following command to change the ownership of the `/media` directory to the user running the Django application:

```
sudo chown -R <username>:<username> /media
```

Replace `<username>` with the username of the user running the Django application.

After changing the ownership of the `/media` directory, you can try uploading the media files again.
