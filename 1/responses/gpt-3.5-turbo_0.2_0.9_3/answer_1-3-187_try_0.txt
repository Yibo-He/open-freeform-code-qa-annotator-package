You can use slicing to replace the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`. Then, you can loop through `last` and replace any element that matches with an element in `b` with the corresponding element in `rest`.

Here's the code to do this:

```
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Replace first 4 elements in b with elements in rest
b[:4] = rest

# Loop through last and replace matching elements with elements in rest
for i in range(len(last)):
    if last[i] in b:
        last[i] = rest[b.index(last[i])]

print(last)
```

This will output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```
