No, you cannot directly convert the entire list to a string using `str(roll)`. This will only convert the list object itself to a string, not the individual elements within the list. 

To convert each element in the list to a string, you will need to iterate over the list and call `str()` on each element. Here's an example:

```
roll = [1, 2, 3]
roll_str = [str(num) for num in roll]
```

This will create a new list `roll_str` with the string representation of each element in `roll`. The output will be:

```
['1', '2', '3']
```

Hope this helps!
