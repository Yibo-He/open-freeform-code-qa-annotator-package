The error message you are receiving indicates that the `git checkout` command is failing. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the specified commit hash not existing in the repository, or the repository not being in a clean state.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check that the specified commit hash exists in the repository by running the `git log` command and verifying that the hash is present.

2. Ensure that the repository is in a clean state by running `git status` and verifying that there are no uncommitted changes or untracked files.

3. Try running the `git checkout` command manually in the terminal to see if you receive any error messages or prompts.

4. Add the `--force` flag to the `git checkout` command to force the checkout, although this should be used with caution as it can overwrite local changes.

5. Check the permissions of the repository directory to ensure that the user running the script has the necessary permissions to execute the `git` command.

Once you have identified the issue, you can modify your code accordingly to handle the error or prevent it from occurring in the first place.
