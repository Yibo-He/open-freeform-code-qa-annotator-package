It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
2. Check that the `app` folder contains an `__init__.py` file. This file is required to make the folder a Python module.
3. Verify that the `main.py` file is located in the `app` folder and has the correct name.
4. Check that the `requirements.txt` file is in the root directory and contains all the required dependencies for the `app` module.
5. Ensure that the `docker-compose.yml` file is correctly configured to build and run the Docker container.

If you have verified all of the above and are still experiencing issues, please provide more information about the error message and any other relevant details.
