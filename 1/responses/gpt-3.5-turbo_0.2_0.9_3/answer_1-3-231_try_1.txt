Yes, you can get the shape of the list without converting it into a numpy array. Since your list contains PyTorch tensors, you can use the `size()` method to get the shape of each tensor in the list. Here's an example:

```
my_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]
for tensor in my_list:
    print(tensor.size())
```

This will print the shape of each tensor in the list. If you want to get the shape of the entire list, you can use the `len()` function:

```
print(len(my_list))
```

This will print the number of tensors in the list.
