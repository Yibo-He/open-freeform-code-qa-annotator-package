It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same directory as the Dockerfile.
2. Check the `COPY` command in the Dockerfile. It should be copying the `app` folder to the `/app` directory in the container. Make sure that the path is correct.
3. Check the `main.py` file in the `app` folder. It should have a `FastAPI` instance named `app`. Make sure that the file is named correctly and has the correct code.
4. Check the `requirements.txt` file. It should list all the required Python packages for the application to run. Make sure that all the packages are listed correctly.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about the directory structure and the contents of the files.
