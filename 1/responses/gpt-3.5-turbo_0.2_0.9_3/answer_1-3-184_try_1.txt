No problem, I can help you with that. Here is a sample code that should do what you are asking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the product name to search for
product_name = 'ABC'

# Loop through all the rows in the sheet
for row in sheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the product name
        if cell.value == product_name:

            # If it does, copy the contents of every cell in the row
            row_contents = []
            for row_cell in row:
                row_contents.append(row_cell.value)

            # Assign every cell to a variable
            cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4, cell5 = row_contents

            # Do something with the variables (e.g. print them)
            print(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4, cell5)
```

This code should loop through all the cells in the sheet and check if they contain the product name. If a cell does contain the product name, it will copy the contents of every cell in the row and assign them to variables. You can then do something with these variables (e.g. print them).
