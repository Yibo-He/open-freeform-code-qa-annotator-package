It seems like there is an issue with removing the 'requests' and 'setuptools' packages from the conda environment. One possible solution is to create a new conda environment and install the required packages in that environment. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Open the Anaconda prompt or terminal.
2. Create a new conda environment by running the following command: `conda create --name myenv python=3.6`
3. Activate the new environment by running the following command: `conda activate myenv`
4. Install the required packages by running the following command: `conda install -c enigma-catalyst catalyst`
5. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment by running the following command: `conda deactivate`

This should create a new conda environment and install the required packages in that environment without any conflicts. You can then use this environment to run your program.
