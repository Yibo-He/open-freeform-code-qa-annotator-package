The error message suggests that there is a problem with the CMake installation. CMake is a tool used to build software, including OpenCV. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure CMake is installed in the docker container. You can check this by running `cmake --version` in the terminal. If it's not installed, you can install it using `sudo apt-get install cmake`.

2. Try upgrading pip to the latest version using `pip install --upgrade pip`.

3. Try installing OpenCV using apt-get instead of pip. You can do this by running `sudo apt-get install python3-opencv`.

4. If none of the above solutions work, you can try building OpenCV from source. Here's a guide on how to do this: https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html.
