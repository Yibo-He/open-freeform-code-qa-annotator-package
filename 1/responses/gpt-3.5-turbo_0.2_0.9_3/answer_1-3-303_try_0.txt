The error message suggests that there is an issue with uninstalling the `wrapt` package. You can try to force uninstall it using the `--force` flag:

```
sudo pip uninstall wrapt --force
```

Then, try installing TensorFlow-GPU again:

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

If this still doesn't work, you can try upgrading `pip` and then installing TensorFlow-GPU again:

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

Regarding the `ModuleNotFoundError` for TensorFlow, it seems like TensorFlow is not installed on your system. You can install it using:

```
pip install tensorflow
```

Make sure to install the version that is compatible with your system and the other packages you are using.
