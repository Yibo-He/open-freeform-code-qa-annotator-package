You can achieve this by checking if the string contains `_` using the `in` operator and then splitting the string accordingly. Here's an example code snippet that should work for you:

```
string = "testing_abc_bbc"

if "_" in string:
    split_string = "_".join(string.split("_")[1:])
else:
    split_string = string

print(split_string)
```

This code first checks if the string contains `_` using the `in` operator. If it does, it splits the string using `_` as the delimiter and joins all the elements after the first element using `_` again. If it doesn't contain `_`, it simply assigns the original string to the `split_string` variable.
