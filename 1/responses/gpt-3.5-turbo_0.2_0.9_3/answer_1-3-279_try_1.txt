The error message indicates that the user running the Django application does not have permission to create the `/media/artists` directory. 

To fix this issue, you need to change the ownership of the `/media` directory to the user running the Django application. You can do this by running the following command in the terminal:

```
sudo chown -R yourusername:yourusername /media
```

Replace `yourusername` with the username of the user running the Django application.

After changing the ownership, you also need to change the permissions of the `/media` directory to allow the user running the Django application to write to it. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo chmod -R 755 /media
```

This will give the owner of the directory (the user running the Django application) read, write, and execute permissions, and everyone else read and execute permissions.

Once you have made these changes, try uploading the media files again.
