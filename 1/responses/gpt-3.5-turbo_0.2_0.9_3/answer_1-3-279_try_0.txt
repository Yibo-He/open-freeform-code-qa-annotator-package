The error message indicates that the user running the Django application does not have the necessary permissions to create the `/media/artists` directory. 

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the owner and permissions of the `/media` directory and make sure that the user running the Django application has write permissions to it.

2. Create the `/media/artists` directory manually with the correct permissions. You can use the following command to create the directory with the correct permissions:

   ```
   sudo mkdir /media/artists
   sudo chown -R <username>:<groupname> /media/artists
   sudo chmod -R 775 /media/artists
   ```

   Replace `<username>` and `<groupname>` with the appropriate values for your system.

3. Update the `MEDIA_ROOT` setting in your `settings.py` file to point to the correct directory:

   ```
   MEDIA_ROOT = '/media/'
   ```

   Note that you don't need to include the `/artists` subdirectory in the `MEDIA_ROOT` setting, as it will be automatically created by Django when you upload files.

4. Restart your Django application and try uploading a file again.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
