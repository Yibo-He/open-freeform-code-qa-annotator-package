Hi Rosalie,

It sounds like you have already created a personal access token for GitHub authentication, which is great! However, you may need to update your Git configuration to use the access token instead of your password.

Here are the steps to update your Git configuration:

1. Open Terminal on your Mac.
2. Navigate to the repository where you want to update the Git configuration.
3. Run the following command to update the Git configuration:

```
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

This command tells Git to use the macOS Keychain to store your access token.

4. Run the following command to remove any existing credentials:

```
git credential-osxkeychain erase
host=github.com
protocol=https
```

5. Push a commit to GitHub. You will be prompted to enter your access token instead of your password.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
