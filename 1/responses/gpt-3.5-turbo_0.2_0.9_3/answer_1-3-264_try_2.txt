The error message "Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead" is because the input to the `predict` method should be a 2D array. You can fix this by wrapping the input in double square brackets like this:

```
print(clf.predict([[0.58,0.76]]))
```

Also, the line `X.reshape(1, -1)` does not actually modify the `X` array. Instead, you can assign the result of the reshape operation to `X` like this:

```
X = X.reshape(1, -1)
```

However, this is not necessary for the code to work correctly.
