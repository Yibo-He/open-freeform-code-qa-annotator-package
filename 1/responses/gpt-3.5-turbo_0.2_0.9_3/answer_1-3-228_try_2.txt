The error message indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required by TensorFlow to run on GPU.

To resolve this issue, you need to add the path to the CUDA library to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This command adds the path `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This is the default installation path for CUDA on Ubuntu.

After running this command, try importing TensorFlow again. It should work without any errors.
