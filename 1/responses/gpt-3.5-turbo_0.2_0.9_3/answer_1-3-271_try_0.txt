You can use regular expressions with positive lookahead to achieve this. Here's the code that should work for your requirements:

```python
import re

def split_string(string):
    pattern = r'\b(.*?)(?=(?:\s(and|&)\s|\s-\s)|$)'
    return re.findall(pattern, string)

# Example usage
print(split_string('121 34 adsfd'))  # ['121 34 adsfd']
print(split_string('dsfsd and adfd'))  # ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
print(split_string('dsfsd & adfd'))  # ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
print(split_string('dsfsd - adfd'))  # ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
print(split_string('dsfsd and adfd and adsfa'))  # ['dsfsd ', ' adfd and adsfa']
print(split_string('dsfsd and adfd - adsfa'))  # ['dsfsd ', ' adfd - adsfa']
print(split_string('dsfsd - adfd and adsfa'))  # ['dsfsd - adfd ', ' adsfa']
```

The regular expression pattern `r'\b(.*?)(?=(?:\s(and|&)\s|\s-\s)|$)'` works as follows:

- `\b` matches a word boundary to ensure that we're not splitting in the middle of a word.
- `(.*?)` matches any character (except newline) zero or more times, as few times as possible.
- `(?=(?:\s(and|&)\s|\s-\s)|$)` is a positive lookahead that matches either of the following:
  - `\s(and|&)\s` matches a space followed by either "and" or "&" followed by another space.
  - `\s-\s` matches a space followed by a hyphen followed by another space.
  - `$` matches the end of the string.
  
The `re.findall()` function returns all non-overlapping matches of the pattern in the string, which gives us the desired output.
