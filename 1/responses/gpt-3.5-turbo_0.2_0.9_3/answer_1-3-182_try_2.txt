Yes, you can achieve this by using the `beta_container` and `beta_columns` components in Streamlit. Here's an example of how you can modify your `Home.py` file to achieve the desired layout:

```
import streamlit as st

# Set page title and favicon
st.set_page_config(page_title="My Multipage App", page_icon=":guardsman:")

# Define the logo and title
logo = ":guardsman:"
title = "My Multipage App"

# Create a container for the logo and title
header = st.beta_container()
col1, col2 = header.beta_columns([1, 3])

# Add the logo and title to the container
with col1:
    st.write(logo)
with col2:
    st.write(f"# {title}")

# Create the navigation menu
menu = ["Home", "Page 1", "Page 2"]
choice = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a page", menu)

# Show the appropriate page based on the user's choice
if choice == "Home":
    st.write("You are on the Home page")
else:
    # Import the appropriate page module
    if choice == "Page 1":
        import pages.Page_1 as page
    elif choice == "Page 2":
        import pages.Page_2 as page

    # Show the page
    page.show()
```

In this modified version of `Home.py`, we first set the page title and favicon using the `set_page_config` function. Then, we define the logo and title and create a container using the `beta_container` component. Within the container, we create two columns using the `beta_columns` component, with the first column containing the logo and the second column containing the title. We then create the navigation menu using the `selectbox` function and show the appropriate page based on the user's choice. Finally, we import the appropriate page module and call its `show` function to display the page content.

Note that we've added a `show` function to each of the page modules (`Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py`) to make it easier to display the page content. Here's an example of what `Page_1.py` could look like:

```
import streamlit as st

def show():
    st.write("You are on Page 1")
```

With these modifications, you should be able to achieve the desired layout for your multipage app. Let me know if you have any questions!
