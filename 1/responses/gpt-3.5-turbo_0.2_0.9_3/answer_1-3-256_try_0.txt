While `pip` will still work for Python 2.7 after its end of life, it is not recommended to continue using Python 2.7 as it will no longer receive security updates or bug fixes. This means that any vulnerabilities or issues that arise will not be addressed, leaving your system and applications at risk. 

It is highly recommended to upgrade to Python 3.x as soon as possible to ensure continued support and security for your applications. Many libraries and frameworks have already dropped support for Python 2.7, so continuing to use it may also limit your ability to use the latest tools and technologies.
