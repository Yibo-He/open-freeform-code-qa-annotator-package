The error message suggests that the `OrdinalModel` class is not found in the `statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model` module. This could be due to a version mismatch or a package installation issue.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of `statsmodels` installed. You can do this by running `pip install --upgrade statsmodels` in your terminal.

2. Check if the `OrdinalModel` class is available in a different module. For example, in newer versions of `statsmodels`, the `OrdinalModel` class is available in the `statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model` module. You can try importing it from there using `from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import OrderedModel`.

3. If none of the above solutions work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling `statsmodels`. You can do this by running `pip uninstall statsmodels` followed by `pip install statsmodels`.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
