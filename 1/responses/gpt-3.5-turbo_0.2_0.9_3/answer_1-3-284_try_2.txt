The `%tensorboard` magic command is not a built-in command in Jupyter Notebook, so you need to install the `jupyter_tensorboard` extension to use it. Here are the steps to install and enable the extension:

1. Install the extension using pip:

   ```
   !pip install jupyter_tensorboard
   ```

2. Enable the extension in Jupyter Notebook:

   ```
   !jupyter serverextension enable --py jupyter_tensorboard
   ```

   ```
   !jupyter nbextension enable --py jupyter_tensorboard
   ```

3. Restart Jupyter Notebook.

After following these steps, you should be able to use the `%tensorboard` magic command to launch TensorBoard in Jupyter Notebook.
