The `f` in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string". It is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In the example you provided, the curly braces `{}` are used to embed the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` inside the string literals. The `f` before the string literal tells Python to evaluate any expressions inside the curly braces and replace them with their values before printing the string.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"/path/to/input"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/path/to/output"`, the first `print` statement will output:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input
```

and the second `print` statement will output:

```
Output directory: /path/to/output
```
