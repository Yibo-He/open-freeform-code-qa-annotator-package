The reason why Python did not return an error and instead returned `[15]` is because the `0x` prefix is used to indicate a hexadecimal number in Python. In this case, `0xfor` is interpreted as the hexadecimal number `0x0f` which is equal to 15 in decimal. Therefore, the expression `[0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)]` is equivalent to `[15 for x in (1, 2, 3)]`, which creates a list containing the value 15 three times.
