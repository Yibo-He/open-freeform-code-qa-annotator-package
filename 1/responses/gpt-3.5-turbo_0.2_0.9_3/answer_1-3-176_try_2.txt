The error message suggests that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install zlib development files:
   - On Windows, you can download the pre-built binaries from the zlib website and install them.
   - On Linux, you can install the zlib development package using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install zlib1g-dev`.

2. Try installing Pillow again using pip:
   ```
   pip install pillow
   ```

If the above steps do not work, you can try installing Pillow from a wheel file instead of building it from source. You can download the appropriate wheel file for your system from the Pillow PyPI page and install it using pip. For example, on Windows, you can download the `Pillow-6.0.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl` file and install it using the following command:
```
pip install Pillow-6.0.0-cp38-cp38-win_amd64.whl
```
