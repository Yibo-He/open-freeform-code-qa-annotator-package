The issue is that the `tf` module is not imported in the scope of the `Lambda` layer when you load the model. To fix this, you can add the following line of code before loading the model:

```
import tensorflow as tf
```

This will ensure that the `tf` module is available in the scope of the `Lambda` layer when you load the model. Your updated code should look like this:

```
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.layers import Lambda
import tensorflow as tf


def learning(test_samples):
    import tensorflow as tf # add this line
    model = load_model('my_model.h5')
    # rest of the code
```
