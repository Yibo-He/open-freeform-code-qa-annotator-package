You can use the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns. Here's an example code:

```R
library(tidyr)

# create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(info = "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC")

# separate the info column into three columns
df_split <- separate(df, info, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:")

# remove the first column since it's no longer needed
df_split <- df_split[, -1]

# view the resulting data frame
df_split
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
```
