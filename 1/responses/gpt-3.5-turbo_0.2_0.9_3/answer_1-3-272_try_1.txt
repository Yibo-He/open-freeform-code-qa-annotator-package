The issue is that the environment variable `PATH` is not being expanded in the YAML file. You can use the `os.path.expandvars()` function to expand environment variables in a string.

Here's an updated version of your script that uses `os.path.expandvars()` to expand the `PATH` variable in the YAML file:

```
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.load_all(stream)
for doc in docs:
    for k,v in doc.items():
        if isinstance(v, str):
            doc[k] = os.path.expandvars(v)
    for k,v in doc.items():
        print k, "->", v
    print "\n",
```

In this version of the script, we check if the value of each key in the YAML file is a string. If it is, we use `os.path.expandvars()` to expand any environment variables in the string. We then print out the updated key-value pairs.

With this updated script, the output should be:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```
