In your code, you are trying to access the characters of the string using the index `i`, which is actually the character itself. Instead, you can use the `replace()` method to replace the dash or underscore with a space, and then split the string into a list of words using the `split()` method. Then, you can capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one, and join the words back together to form the camel case string. Here's the corrected code:

```
def to_camel_case(text):
    text = text.replace('-', ' ').replace('_', ' ')
    words = text.split()
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This should pass all the test cases.
