The `f` in `print(f"...")` stands for "formatted string". It is a feature introduced in Python 3.6 that allows you to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. 

In the example you provided, the expressions inside the curly braces are `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory`. These expressions are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string at the corresponding curly brace locations.

For example, if `args.input_directory` is `"/path/to/input/directory"` and `args.output_directory` is `"/path/to/output/directory"`, the output of the two `print` statements would be:

```
Input directory: /path/to/input/directory
Output directory: /path/to/output/directory
```

The `f` before the string literal tells Python to treat the string as a formatted string and to evaluate any expressions inside the curly braces.
