You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the package size in bytes. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the list of packages to appear. The size of each package will be displayed in bytes in the rightmost column.

Alternatively, you can use the `conda info --json` command to get a JSON object containing information about all installed packages, including their size. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda info --json` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the JSON object to appear. Each package is represented as an object with a `size` property containing the package size in bytes.

You can also use the `du` command to find the size of the `pkgs` directory in your Anaconda installation. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `du -sh <path-to-anaconda>/pkgs` and press Enter, replacing `<path-to-anaconda>` with the actual path to your Anaconda installation.
3. Wait for the size of the `pkgs` directory to appear in a human-readable format. This will give you an idea of how much disk space your installed packages are taking up.
