You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the size of each package in your current environment. This command will show the package size in bytes.

Alternatively, you can use the `conda info --json` command to get information about your current environment in JSON format, including the size of each package. You can then use a JSON parser to extract the package size information.

Here's an example of how to use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Activate the environment for which you want to list the package sizes using the command `conda activate <environment_name>`.
3. Run the command `conda list --show-channel-urls`. This will display a list of all packages installed in the current environment, along with their version numbers and sizes.

Here's an example of how to use the `conda info --json` command:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Activate the environment for which you want to list the package sizes using the command `conda activate <environment_name>`.
3. Run the command `conda info --json`. This will display information about your current environment in JSON format.
4. Use a JSON parser to extract the package size information. For example, you can use the following command to extract the size of the `numpy` package: `conda info --json | jq '.packages."numpy-1.19.2-py38hadc3359_0".size'`, assuming you have the `jq` JSON parser installed.
