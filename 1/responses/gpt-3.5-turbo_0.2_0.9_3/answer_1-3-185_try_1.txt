One way to improve the accuracy of the OCR is to preprocess the image before applying the OCR. Here are some suggestions:

1. Apply a blur filter to the image to remove noise and smooth out the edges of the characters. You can use the `cv2.GaussianBlur()` function for this.

2. Apply a threshold to the image to convert it to a binary image. This will make it easier for the OCR to identify the characters. You can use the `cv2.threshold()` function for this.

3. Apply some morphological operations to the image to remove any small holes or gaps in the characters. You can use the `cv2.erode()` and `cv2.dilate()` functions for this.

Here's an example code that applies these steps:

```
import cv2
import pytesseract

pytesseract.pytesseract.tesseract_cmd = r"C:\Users\HPO2KOR\AppData\Local\Tesseract-OCR\tesseract.exe"

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread("untitled.png")

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply a blur filter
blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray, (5, 5), 0)

# Apply a threshold
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(blur, 0, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV+cv2.THRESH_OTSU)

# Apply some morphological operations
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3,3))
thresh = cv2.erode(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)
thresh = cv2.dilate(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)

# Save the preprocessed image
cv2.imwrite("preprocessed.png", thresh)

# Apply OCR
data = pytesseract.image_to_string(thresh, lang='eng')

# Print the result
print(data)
```

You can adjust the parameters of the blur filter, threshold, and morphological operations to get better results.
