Yes, you can use the `pandas.Period` function to convert your datetime format to a period format with a frequency of 'A' (annual). Then, you can use the `days_in_year` attribute to get the total number of days in that year.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example datetime string
date_str = '2020-03-30'

# Convert to pandas datetime format
date = pd.to_datetime(date_str)

# Convert to period format with frequency of 'A' (annual)
year = date.to_period('A')

# Get total number of days in the year
days_in_year = year.days_in_year

print(days_in_year)  # Output: 366 (for 2020)
```

Hope this helps!
