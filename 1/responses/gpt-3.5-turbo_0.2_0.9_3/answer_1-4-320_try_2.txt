You can use the `is.na()` function to check for missing values in the specified columns and then use the `rowSums()` function to count the number of missing values in each row. If the count is equal to the number of columns, it means that the row has a complete set of NAs in those columns and should be removed. Here's an example code:

```
final[rowSums(is.na(final[, 456:555])) != ncol(final[, 456:555]),]
```

This code will keep the rows that have at least one non-missing value in columns 456 to 555 and remove the rows that have a complete set of NAs in those columns.
