You can install a specific version of Python 3 using brew by specifying the version number in the command. Here's how you can install Python 3.6.5:

1. Open Terminal on your macOS.
2. Run the following command to update Homebrew to the latest version:

```
brew update
```

3. Run the following command to install Python 3.6.5:

```
brew install python@3.6
```

This will install Python 3.6.5 and link it to `/usr/local/bin/python3.6`. You can verify the installation by running the following command:

```
python3.6 --version
```

This should output `Python 3.6.5`.

Note that installing multiple versions of Python using brew can cause conflicts, so it's recommended to use a virtual environment or a tool like pyenv to manage different Python versions.
