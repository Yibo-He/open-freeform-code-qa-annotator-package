The reason why Python returns `[15]` instead of an error is because the `0x` prefix is used to indicate a hexadecimal number in Python. In this case, `0xfor` is interpreted as `0xf * or`, where `0xf` is the hexadecimal representation of the decimal number 15. Therefore, the expression `[0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)]` is equivalent to `[15 for x in (1, 2, 3)]`, which creates a list with three elements, all equal to 15.
