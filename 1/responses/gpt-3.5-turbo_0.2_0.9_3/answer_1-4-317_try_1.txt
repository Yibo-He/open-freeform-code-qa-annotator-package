To replace all corresponding values from `new_big` in `big`, you can use an update join. Here's how you can do it:
```
big[new_big, col := i.col, on = "id"]
```
This will update the `col` column in `big` with the corresponding values from `new_big` based on the `id` column. The `:=` operator is used to update by reference, which is more memory efficient than creating a new copy of the table. 

The updated `big` table will look like this:
```
> big
    id col
 1:  B   1
 2:  C 103
 3:  D 102
 4:  E  11
 5:  F 104
 6:  G 111
 7:  H 104
 8:  I 104
 9:  J 104
10:  K 103
```
