The issue with your code is that the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop. This means that the function returns the first word after it has been transformed, but it never gets to the other words in the loop. To fix this, you can move the `return` statement outside of the loop, after all the words have been transformed. Here's the corrected code:

```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  new_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    new_word = ''.join(them)
    new_words.append(new_word)
  return ' '.join(new_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this corrected code, we create a new list `new_words` to store the transformed words. We then loop through each word in `words`, transform it, and append it to `new_words`. Finally, we join all the words in `new_words` with spaces and return the resulting string.
