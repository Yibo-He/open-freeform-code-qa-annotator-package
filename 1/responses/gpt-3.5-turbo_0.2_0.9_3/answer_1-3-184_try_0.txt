No worries, I can help you with that. Here's a code snippet that should do what you're asking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the search term
search_term = 'ABC'

# Create a list to store the results
results = []

# Loop through each row in the worksheet
for row in worksheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through each cell in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the search term
        if search_term in str(cell.value):

            # If it does, add the entire row to the results list
            results.append([cell.value for cell in row])

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

This code will load the Excel file, select the `Sheet1` worksheet, and define the search term as `ABC`. It will then loop through each row in the worksheet, and for each row, loop through each cell. If the cell contains the search term, it will add the entire row to the `results` list. Finally, it will print out the results.

Note that this code assumes that the first row of the worksheet contains the column headers. If this is not the case, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.
