The error message is indicating that the condition `mask_black == cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black)` is ambiguous because it is comparing two arrays. Instead, you should use the `np.array_equal()` function to compare the two arrays. Here's an example:

```
import numpy as np
import cv2

mask_black = cv2.inRange(hsv, low_black, high_black)
mask_not = cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black)

if np.array_equal(mask_black, cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black)):
    # black background detected, white line should be detected
    # do something
else:
    # white background detected, black line should be detected
    # do something else
```

This should solve the error you were getting and allow you to detect the white line or black line based on the background color.
