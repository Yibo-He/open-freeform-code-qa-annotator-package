It sounds like there may be an issue with the Python extension in VSCode. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Python extension installed. You can check for updates in the Extensions tab in VSCode.

2. Try specifying the path to your Python interpreter directly in your `launch.json` file, instead of using `${command:python.interpreterPath}`. For example:

```
"pythonPath": "/path/to/python"
```

3. If you're using a virtual environment, make sure it's activated before running the debugger. You can activate a virtual environment by running the command `source /path/to/venv/bin/activate` in your terminal.

4. Try reinstalling Python and the Python extension in VSCode.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get your debugger up and running again. If not, feel free to ask for more help!
