To sort a list of characters alphabetically, you can use the `sort()` function directly on the vector of characters, without converting it to a list. Here's the corrected code:

```
# Creating a random vector of letters
random_text_data = sample(letters, 10)
random_text_data

# Sort vector alphabetically
sorted_data = sort(random_text_data)
sorted_data
```

This will give you the sorted list of characters:

```
[1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "h" "j" "n" "t"
```
