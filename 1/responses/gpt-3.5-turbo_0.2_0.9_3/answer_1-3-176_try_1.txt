The error message indicates that the headers or library files for zlib are missing, which is a required dependency for Pillow. You can try installing zlib using the following command:

```
pip install zlib
```

If that doesn't work, you can try installing Pillow using pre-built binaries instead of building from source. You can download the appropriate binary for your system from the Pillow website (https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html#binary-installation) and install it using pip:

```
pip install <path-to-binary-file>
```

Alternatively, you can try installing Pillow using conda instead of pip:

```
conda install pillow
```
