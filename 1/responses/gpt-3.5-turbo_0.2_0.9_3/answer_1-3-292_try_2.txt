Yes, there are several ways to extract the star logo from the image. One common method is to use image segmentation techniques. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Apply a threshold to the image to separate the logo from the background. You can experiment with different threshold values to find the best one.
3. Use morphological operations such as erosion and dilation to remove any noise and fill in any gaps in the logo.
4. Find the contours of the logo using a contour detection algorithm.
5. Select the contour that corresponds to the star logo and extract it from the image.

Here is some sample code in Python using OpenCV library:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.png')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply threshold
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Apply morphological operations
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (5, 5))
thresh = cv2.erode(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)
thresh = cv2.dilate(thresh, kernel, iterations=1)

# Find contours
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Select the contour that corresponds to the star logo
logo_contour = None
for contour in contours:
    area = cv2.contourArea(contour)
    if area > 1000 and area < 5000:
        logo_contour = contour
        break

# Extract the logo from the image
if logo_contour is not None:
    x, y, w, h = cv2.boundingRect(logo_contour)
    logo = img[y:y+h, x:x+w]
    cv2.imshow('Logo', logo)
    cv2.waitKey(0)
```

Note that the threshold value and morphological operations parameters may need to be adjusted depending on the image.
