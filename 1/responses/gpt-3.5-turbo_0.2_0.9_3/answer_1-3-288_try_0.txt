You can use a for loop and increment the index by 1 each time through the loop. Here's an example:

```
my_string = 'teststring'

for i in range(len(my_string)-1):
    print(my_string[i:i+2])
```

This will output:

```
te
es
st
ts
st
tr
ri
in
ng
``` 

In this example, we use the `range()` function to loop through the indices of the string. We subtract 1 from the length of the string because we want to stop the loop before the last character (since we're slicing 2 characters at a time). 

Then, we use string slicing to get the two characters at the current index and the next index (`my_string[i:i+2]`). We print this out for each iteration of the loop.
