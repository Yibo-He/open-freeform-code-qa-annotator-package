The error message you are seeing is related to TensorFlow XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) devices. XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can optimize TensorFlow computations for performance. 

To fix this issue, you can try setting the `tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` environment variable to `true` before running your program. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
export TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices
```

Alternatively, you can try disabling XLA by setting the `TF_XLA_FLAGS` environment variable to an empty string:

```
export TF_XLA_FLAGS=
```

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to reinstall TensorFlow with XLA support. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow==2.4.1 tensorflow-gpu==2.4.1
```

This will install the GPU version of TensorFlow with XLA support. Make sure to uninstall your current version of TensorFlow before running this command.
