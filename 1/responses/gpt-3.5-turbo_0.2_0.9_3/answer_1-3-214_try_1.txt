It seems like the issue is with the `join_axes` argument, which was removed in Pandas 1.0. You can try updating the `pandas-profiling` package to the latest version, which should be compatible with Pandas 1.0. 

To update the package, you can run the following command in your conda environment:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling
```

Once the package is updated, you can try running the `ProfileReport` function again. If you still encounter issues, please let me know and I'll try to help you further.
