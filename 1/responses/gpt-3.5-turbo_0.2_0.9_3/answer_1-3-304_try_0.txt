Your code is almost correct. The issue is with the range of the loop. You are iterating over the length of the output array minus 2, which means that the last two elements are not being updated correctly. To fix this, you can change the range to iterate over the length of the input array minus 2. Also, you can use the `astype` method to convert the output array to integers.

Here's the corrected code:

```
output = np.empty(len(load))
for i in range(len(load)-2):
    output[i] = load[i]+load[i+1]+load[i+2]
output[-2:] = load[-2:]
output = output.astype(int)
print(output)
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
[31 34 39 53 65 76 79 78 72 66 60 58 60 66 72 78 77 75 68 63 55 47 29 13]
```
