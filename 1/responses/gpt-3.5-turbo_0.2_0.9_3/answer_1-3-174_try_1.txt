It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of psycopg2 on your system. One possible solution is to try installing psycopg2-binary instead of psycopg2. You can do this by running the following command in your conda environment:

```
conda install psycopg2-binary
```

This should install a pre-compiled binary version of psycopg2, which might solve the DLL load error you are seeing.

If that doesn't work, you can try installing psycopg2 using pip instead of conda:

```
pip install psycopg2
```

This will download and install the latest version of psycopg2 from PyPI.

If neither of these solutions work, you might need to investigate further to see if there are any other issues with your system or environment that could be causing the problem.
