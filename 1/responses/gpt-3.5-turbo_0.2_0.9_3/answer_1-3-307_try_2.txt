The error message you provided suggests that the `ordinal_model` module is not found in the `statsmodels.miscmodels` package. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Outdated statsmodels version: Make sure you have the latest version of statsmodels installed. You can do this by running `pip install --upgrade statsmodels`.

2. Incorrect import statement: Double-check that you are importing the correct module. The `OrderedModel` class is actually located in the `statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model` module, not `statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model`. Try changing your import statement to `from statsmodels.discrete.discrete_model import OrderedModel`.

3. Missing dependencies: The `ordinal_model` module requires the `patsy` package to be installed. Make sure you have `patsy` installed by running `pip install patsy`.

Once you have addressed any of the above issues, you should be able to import and use the `OrderedModel` class without any errors.
