The error message suggests that there is a problem with the CMake installation. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Update the package list and upgrade the installed packages:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

2. Install the required dependencies for OpenCV:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake git libgtk2.0-dev pkg-config libavcodec-dev libavformat-dev libswscale-dev
```

3. Clone the OpenCV repository and checkout the desired version:
```
git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git
cd opencv
git checkout 4.4.0
```

4. Create a build directory and run CMake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..
```

5. Build and install OpenCV:
```
make -j4
sudo make install
```

6. Finally, try installing OpenCV again using pip:
```
pip3 install opencv-python
```

If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling CMake or installing a different version of OpenCV.
