It seems like there is a conflict with the `llvmlite` package that is preventing `librosa` from being installed. One solution you can try is to uninstall `llvmlite` using the following command:

```
pip uninstall llvmlite
```

After that, try installing `librosa` again using `pip install librosa`. If the installation is successful, you can then reinstall `llvmlite` using `pip install llvmlite`.

If this doesn't work, you can try creating a new virtual environment and installing `librosa` there. Sometimes, conflicts between packages can be resolved by isolating them in a separate environment. Here's how you can create a new virtual environment:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type the following command to create a new environment:

   ```
   conda create --name myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with the name you want to give your environment.
3. Activate the new environment by typing:

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Again, replace `myenv` with the name of your environment.
4. Install `librosa` using `pip install librosa`.
5. If the installation is successful, you can then use `conda install` to install any other packages you need in this environment.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
