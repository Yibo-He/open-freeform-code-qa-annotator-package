It seems like there is an issue with uninstalling the `wrapt` package. You can try to force uninstall it using the `--nodeps` flag:

```
sudo yum remove wrapt --nodeps
```

Then, try installing TensorFlow-GPU again:

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

Make sure to activate your virtual environment before installing TensorFlow-GPU if you are using one.
