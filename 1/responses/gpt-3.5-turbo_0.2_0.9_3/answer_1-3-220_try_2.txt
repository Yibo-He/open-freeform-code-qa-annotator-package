Yes, you can use the `boto3` library to get a list of all the resources in your AWS account. However, there is no single function that will give you a complete list of all resources. Instead, you will need to use different functions for different types of resources.

Here's an example of how to get a list of all EC2 instances in your account:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.resource('ec2')

instances = ec2.instances.all()

for instance in instances:
    print(instance.id)
```

Similarly, you can use the following code to get a list of all S3 buckets in your account:

```python
import boto3

s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

buckets = s3.buckets.all()

for bucket in buckets:
    print(bucket.name)
```

You can use similar code to get a list of other types of resources, such as RDS instances, Lambda functions, etc.
