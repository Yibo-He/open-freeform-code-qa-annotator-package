The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want to do. Instead, you should check if every character in the input string is present in the `correct` string. You can do this using a loop and the `all()` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```
import string
text = input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if all(char in correct for char in text):
    print("Success")
```

This code loops through every character in the input string and checks if it is present in the `correct` string. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the characters are present in `correct`, and `False` otherwise.
