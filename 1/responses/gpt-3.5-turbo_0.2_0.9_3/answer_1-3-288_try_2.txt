You can use a for loop and step through the string by 1 index each time. Then, you can slice the string to get the desired output. Here's an example:

```
my_string = 'teststring'

for i in range(len(my_string)-1):
    print(my_string[i:i+2])
```

This will output:

```
te
es
st
ts
st
tr
ri
in
ng
``` 

In the for loop, we are iterating through the indices of the string using `range(len(my_string)-1)`. We subtract 1 from the length of the string because we are slicing 2 characters at a time, and we don't want to go out of bounds. 

Then, we slice the string using `my_string[i:i+2]` to get the 2 characters at the current index and the next index. We print this out for each iteration of the loop.
