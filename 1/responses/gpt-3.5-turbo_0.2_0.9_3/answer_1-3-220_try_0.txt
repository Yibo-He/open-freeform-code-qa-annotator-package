Yes, you can use the `boto3` library to get a list of all the resources in your AWS account. However, you will need to use different functions for different types of resources. For example, to get a list of all EC2 instances, you can use the `ec2` client and call the `describe_instances()` method. Similarly, to get a list of all S3 buckets, you can use the `s3` client and call the `list_buckets()` method.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates how to get a list of all EC2 instances in your AWS account:

```python
import boto3

ec2 = boto3.client('ec2')

response = ec2.describe_instances()

instances = []

for reservation in response['Reservations']:
    for instance in reservation['Instances']:
        instances.append(instance)

print(instances)
```

This code will print a list of all EC2 instances in your account. You can modify this code to get a list of other types of resources as well.
