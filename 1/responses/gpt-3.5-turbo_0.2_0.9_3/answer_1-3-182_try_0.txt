Yes, you can achieve this by using Streamlit's `beta_container` and `beta_columns` functions. Here's an example implementation:

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

# Set page title and favicon
st.set_page_config(page_title="My App", page_icon=":guardsman:")

# Define sidebar logo and title
sidebar_logo = st.sidebar.beta_container()
with sidebar_logo:
    st.image("path/to/logo.png", use_column_width=True)
    st.markdown("# My App")

# Define page navigation
pages = {
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2,
}
page = st.sidebar.radio("Go to", list(pages.keys()))

# Display selected page
pages[page]()
```

`Page_1.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def Page_1():
    st.markdown("## Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def Page_2():
    st.markdown("## Page 2")
```

In this implementation, we use `beta_container` to create a container for the logo and title in the sidebar. We then use `beta_columns` to display the logo and title side-by-side. Finally, we use `set_page_config` to set the page title and favicon.

Note that we import the `Page_1` and `Page_2` functions from their respective files, and call them as functions in the `pages` dictionary. This allows us to easily switch between pages using the `radio` widget in the sidebar.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
