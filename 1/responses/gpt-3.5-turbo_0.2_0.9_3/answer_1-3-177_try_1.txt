The `designer.exe` file is usually located in the `Scripts` folder within the directory where Python is installed. 

You can try searching for the `designer.exe` file by following these steps:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal.
2. Type `where designer.exe` and press Enter.
3. If the file is found, the command prompt will display the full path to the file.

If the file is not found, you may need to reinstall PyQT5 and make sure that you select the option to install the designer tool during the installation process.
