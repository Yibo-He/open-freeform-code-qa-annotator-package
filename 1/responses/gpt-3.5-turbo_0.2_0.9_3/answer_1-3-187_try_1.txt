You can use list slicing and list comprehension to achieve this. Here's an example code:

```
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Replace first 4 elements in b with elements in rest
b[:4] = rest

# Replace elements in last according to matches with b
last = [rest[b.index(i)] if i in b else i for i in last]

print(last)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

Explanation:
- `b[:4] = rest` replaces the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`.
- `[rest[b.index(i)] if i in b else i for i in last]` creates a new list where each element in `last` is replaced by the corresponding element in `rest` if it exists in `b`, otherwise it remains the same. The `if i in b` condition checks if the element in `last` exists in `b`, and `rest[b.index(i)]` gets the corresponding element in `rest` using the index of the element in `b`.
