To get the boundary of the rectangle, you can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage` library. Here's an example code:

```python
from skimage import measure

# assuming "mask" is your binary mask
contours = measure.find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# get the first contour (assuming there's only one)
boundary = contours[0]

# plot the boundary
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(boundary[:, 1], boundary[:, 0])
plt.show()
```

This should give you the desired boundary of the rectangle. The `find_contours` function finds all the contours in the binary mask, and each contour is represented as a list of (y, x) coordinates. Since you only have one contour (the boundary), you can just take the first one.
