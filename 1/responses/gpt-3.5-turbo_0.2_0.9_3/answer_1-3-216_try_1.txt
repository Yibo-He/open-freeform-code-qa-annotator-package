Yes, you will be able to run Homebrew on your MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has already been updated to support the new M1 architecture. You can install Homebrew by following the instructions on their website.

Once you have Homebrew installed, you can use it to install various development tools, including Python and Node.js. However, not all packages may be available for the M1 architecture yet, so you may need to check if a specific package is compatible before installing it.
