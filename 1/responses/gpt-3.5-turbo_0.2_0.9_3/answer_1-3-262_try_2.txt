It looks like there may be an issue with your pip installation. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling pip to see if that resolves the issue. 

To uninstall pip, you can use the following command:

```
sudo apt-get remove python3-pip
```

After that, you can reinstall pip using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

Once pip is reinstalled, you can try installing Jupyter Notebook again using the following command:

```
pip3 install jupyter
```

If you continue to have issues, you may want to try creating a virtual environment and installing Jupyter Notebook within that environment. This can help isolate any issues with your system's Python installation.
