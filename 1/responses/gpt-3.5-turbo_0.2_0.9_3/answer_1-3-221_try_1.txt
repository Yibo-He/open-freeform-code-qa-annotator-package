It sounds like there may be an issue with the Python extension in VSCode. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of the Python extension installed. You can check for updates by going to the Extensions tab in VSCode and searching for "Python".

2. Try specifying the path to your Python interpreter directly in your `launch.json` file, rather than using the `${command:python.interpreterPath}` variable. For example:

```
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "pythonPath": "/path/to/python/interpreter"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. If neither of the above solutions work, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VSCode.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get your debugger working again!
