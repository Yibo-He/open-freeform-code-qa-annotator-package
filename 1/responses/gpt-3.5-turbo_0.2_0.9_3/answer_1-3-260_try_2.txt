It seems like the Python interpreter you are using in Atom is not the same one where you installed the BeautifulSoup module. 

To solve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check which version of Python is being used in Atom. You can do this by opening the terminal in Atom and running the following command:

   ```
   $ which python
   ```

   This will give you the path of the Python interpreter being used in Atom.

2. Install the BeautifulSoup module for the Python version being used in Atom. For example, if the path from step 1 shows that Python 2.7.10 is being used, then run the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   $ sudo pip2 install beautifulsoup4
   ```

   If the path shows that Python 3.8.5 is being used, then run the following command:

   ```
   $ sudo pip3 install beautifulsoup4
   ```

3. Once the module is installed, try running your code again in Atom.

If the above steps do not work, you can try setting up a virtual environment in Atom and installing the required modules within the virtual environment. This will ensure that the correct version of Python and modules are being used.
