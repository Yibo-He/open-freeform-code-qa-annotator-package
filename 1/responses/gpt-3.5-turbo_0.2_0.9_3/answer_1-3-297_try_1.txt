To import existing resources listed on a map, you need to use the `for_each` meta-argument in your resource block. Here's an example of how you can import the existing S3 buckets:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  # other configuration

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      # Add any attributes that should be ignored during updates
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, you can run the following command to import the existing S3 buckets:

```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"] cloudtrail_bucket
```

Make sure to replace `logs_bucket` and `cloudtrail_bucket` with the actual names of your existing S3 buckets. Also, note that you need to use the keys from your `s3_replication` map to reference the resources in Terraform.
