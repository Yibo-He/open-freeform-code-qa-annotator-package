The error message is telling you that you cannot use a string as an index for a list. In your case, `a` is a list with one element, which is a string containing a JSON object. To access the value of the `id` key in the JSON object, you need to first parse the string into a Python dictionary using the `json` module. Here's an example:

```python
import json

a = ['{"id":9,"name":"Foo"}']
json_obj = json.loads(a[0])
print(json_obj['id'])
```

Output:

```
9
```

In this example, we first import the `json` module, which provides functions for encoding and decoding JSON data. We then use the `json.loads()` function to parse the string in `a[0]` into a Python dictionary called `json_obj`. Finally, we access the value of the `id` key in `json_obj` using the square bracket notation.
