The `%tensorboard` magic command is not a built-in command in Jupyter Notebook. It is provided by the `jupyter_tensorboard` extension, which needs to be installed separately. 

To install the `jupyter_tensorboard` extension, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install jupyter_tensorboard
```

After installing the extension, you can load it in your Jupyter Notebook by running the following command:

```
%load_ext tensorboard
```

Then, you can use the `%tensorboard` magic command to start TensorBoard:

```
%tensorboard --logdir {logs_base_dir}
```

Make sure that you have the latest version of TensorFlow installed as well.
