Hi Rosalie,

It sounds like you have already created a personal access token for GitHub authentication. However, you may need to update your Git remote URLs to use the token instead of your password.

To do this, you can update your remote URL in the terminal using the following command:

```
git remote set-url origin https://username:token@github.com/username/repo.git
```

Replace "username" with your GitHub username and "token" with your personal access token. You can find your personal access token in your GitHub account settings.

Once you have updated your remote URL, you should be able to push commits to GitHub without using your password.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
