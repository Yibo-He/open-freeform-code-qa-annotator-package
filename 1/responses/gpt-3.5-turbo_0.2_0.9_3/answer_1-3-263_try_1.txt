The `f` in `print(f"...")` stands for formatted string literals, also known as f-strings. F-strings were introduced in Python 3.6 and provide a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals. 

In the example you provided, the `f` before the string indicates that it is a formatted string literal. The expressions inside the curly braces `{}` are evaluated and their values are inserted into the string at runtime. This allows you to easily include variables and other expressions in your output string without having to concatenate strings or use string formatting methods.

For example, in the first `print` statement, the value of `args.input_directory` is inserted into the string at the position of `{args.input_directory}`. Similarly, in the second `print` statement, the value of `args.output_directory` is inserted into the string at the position of `{args.output_directory}`.
