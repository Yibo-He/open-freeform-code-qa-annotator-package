It sounds like you have already taken the necessary steps to make sure that `nb_conda_kernels` is installed in your base environment. However, there are a few additional steps that you can take to make sure that your new environment is recognized as a kernel in Jupyter Lab.

First, make sure that you have activated your new environment before launching Jupyter Lab. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```
conda activate <new_environment_name>
```

Once you have activated your new environment, you can launch Jupyter Lab by running the following command:

```
jupyter lab
```

If your new environment is not showing up as a kernel in Jupyter Lab, you can try running the following command to install the kernel into Jupyter Lab:

```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name <new_environment_name> --display-name "<New Environment Name>"
```

This command will install the kernel for your new environment and give it a display name that will show up in Jupyter Lab.

If you still have trouble, you can try restarting Jupyter Lab or your terminal session to make sure that all changes have been properly loaded.
