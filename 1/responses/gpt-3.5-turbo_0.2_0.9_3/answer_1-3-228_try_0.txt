The error message indicates that the TensorFlow library is unable to find the required shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required for TensorFlow to work with GPU acceleration.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the `libcublas.so.10.0` file is present in the CUDA installation directory. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   $ find /usr/local/cuda -name libcublas.so.10.0
   ```

   If the file is not found, it may be missing or not installed properly. In this case, you may need to reinstall CUDA.

2. If the file is found, you can try adding the CUDA library path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

   This will add the CUDA library path to the beginning of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

3. Try importing TensorFlow again and see if the issue is resolved.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling TensorFlow and CUDA to ensure that they are installed properly and all dependencies are met.
