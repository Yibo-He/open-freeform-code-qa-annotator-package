It seems like there might be an issue with the IPython kernel connection. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that the IPython kernel is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating the environment and running `pip list` to see if `ipykernel` is listed.

2. Try launching Jupyter Notebook outside of VS Code to see if it works. Open a command prompt or terminal, activate your virtual environment, and run `jupyter notebook`. If it works, then the issue might be with VS Code.

3. Try creating a new virtual environment and installing the IPython kernel there. Then, try launching Jupyter Notebook from within that environment in VS Code. If it works, then there might be an issue with your original virtual environment.

4. Check if there are any firewall or antivirus settings that might be blocking the connection to the IPython kernel.

5. Try updating the Python extension in VS Code to the latest version.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue.
