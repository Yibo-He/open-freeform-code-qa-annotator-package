Yes, you can get the shape of the list without converting it into a numpy array. Since your list contains PyTorch tensors, you can use the `size()` method of PyTorch tensors to get their shape. Here's an example code snippet that shows how to get the shape of your list:

```
import torch

# Your list of PyTorch tensors
my_list = [
    torch.tensor([[-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9855, -1.0069],  
                  [-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -1.0069, -1.0283, -1.0927],  
                  [-0.2567, -0.2567, -0.2138,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.1784],  
                  ...,  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.6211,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.0927],  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9426, -0.9640, -0.9640],  
                  [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9426, -0.9426]]),

    torch.tensor([[-0.0769, -0.0980, -0.0769,  ..., -0.9388, -0.9598, -0.9808],  
                  [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0980,  ..., -0.9598, -1.0018, -1.0228],    
                  [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0769,  ..., -1.0228, -1.0439, -1.0859],  
                  ...,  
                  [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -1.0018, -1.0439, -1.0228],  
                  [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.8757, -0.9177, -0.9177],  
                  [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.9177, -0.8967, -0.8967]]),

    torch.tensor([[-0.1313, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8328, -0.8753],  
                  [-0.1313, -0.1525, -0.1313,  ..., -0.8541, -0.8966, -0.9391],  
                  [-0.1100, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.9391, -0.9816, -1.0666],  
                  ...,  
                  [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8966, -0.8966, -0.8966],  
                  [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8115, -0.7903],  
                  [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.7690, -0.7690]]),
]

# Get the shape of each tensor in the list
for tensor in my_list:
    print(tensor.size())
```

This will output the shape of each tensor in your list:

```
torch.Size([64, 64])
torch.Size([64, 64])
torch.Size([64, 64])
```
