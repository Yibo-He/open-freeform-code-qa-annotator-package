The issue is that the `${PATH}` syntax is not being interpreted as an environment variable by the YAML parser. One way to solve this is to use Python's string formatting to replace `${PATH}` with the actual value of the `PATH` environment variable before parsing the YAML file.

Here's an updated version of your script that does this:

```
import yaml
import os

# Read the YAML file as a string
with open("sample.yml", "r") as f:
    yaml_str = f.read()

# Replace ${PATH} with the actual value of the PATH environment variable
path_value = os.environ.get("PATH", "")
yaml_str = yaml_str.replace("${PATH}", path_value)

# Parse the YAML string
docs = yaml.load_all(yaml_str)

# Print the parsed YAML
for doc in docs:
    for k, v in doc.items():
        print(k, "->", v)
    print("\n")
```

This should produce the expected output:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```
