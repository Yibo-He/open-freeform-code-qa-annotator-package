You can use the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns based on a delimiter. Here's an example code:

```
library(tidyr)

# create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(info = "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC")

# separate the column into three columns based on the delimiter ","
df_split <- separate(df, col = info, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",")

# remove the prefix from each column
df_split$name <- gsub("name:", "", df_split$name)
df_split$Age <- gsub("Age:", "", df_split$Age)
df_split$City <- gsub("City:", "", df_split$City)

# display the resulting data frame
df_split
```

This should give you a data frame with three separate columns for name, Age, and City.
