You can use the `pip` package to programmatically check if a package is at its latest version and return a boolean value. Here's an example script:

```
import pip

def is_latest_version(package_name):
    # Get the package information
    package_info = pip.get_installed_distributions()
    # Find the package in the list
    for package in package_info:
        if package.key == package_name:
            # Check if the package is at its latest version
            latest_version = pip.get_latest_version(package_name)
            return package.version == latest_version
    # If the package is not found, return False
    return False
```

You can call this function with the name of the package you want to check, and it will return `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise. For example:

```
package_name = 'gekko'
is_latest = is_latest_version(package_name)
print(f"{package_name} is at its latest version: {is_latest}")
```
