To install Python 3.7.0 in a clean environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the source code for Python 3.7.0 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

2. Extract the source code to a directory of your choice.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code.

4. Run the following commands to configure and build Python:

```
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j8
sudo make altinstall
```

The `--enable-optimizations` flag enables some additional optimizations during the build process, which can improve the performance of Python.

The `make -j8` command builds Python using 8 parallel jobs, which can speed up the build process on multi-core systems. You can adjust the number of jobs to match the number of cores on your system.

The `sudo make altinstall` command installs Python 3.7.0 alongside any other versions of Python that may be installed on your system. This ensures that your system's default Python version is not affected.

5. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Python 3.7.0 is installed by running the following command:

```
python3.7 --version
```

This should output the version number of Python 3.7.0.

6. Finally, you can install any required Python packages using pip:

```
python3.7 -m pip install <package-name>
```

This will install the package for Python 3.7.0 specifically, rather than for any other versions of Python that may be installed on your system.
