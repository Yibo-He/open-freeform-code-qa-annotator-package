Instead of using `replace()` method, you can try using the `splitlines()` method to split the content into lines and then join them back without the newline characters. Here's an example:

```
from tika import parser

filename = 'myfile.pdf'
raw = parser.from_file(filename)
content = raw['content']
content = ''.join(content.splitlines())
print(content)
```

This should remove all the newline characters from the content.
