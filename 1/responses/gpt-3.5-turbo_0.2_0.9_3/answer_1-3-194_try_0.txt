You can use the `openpyxl` library to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here's an example code:

```
import openpyxl

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

# Create a new workbook and select the active worksheet
workbook = openpyxl.Workbook()
worksheet = workbook.active

# Write the data to the worksheet
for row in new_list:
    worksheet.append(row)

# Save the workbook
workbook.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

This code creates a new Excel workbook, selects the active worksheet, and writes the data from the `new_list` variable to the worksheet. Finally, it saves the workbook as an Excel file with the name "file_name.xlsx".
