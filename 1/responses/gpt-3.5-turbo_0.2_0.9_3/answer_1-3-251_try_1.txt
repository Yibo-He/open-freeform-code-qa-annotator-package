It seems like the `mariadb_config` utility is not installed on your system. You can try installing it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev
```

After installing `libmariadb-dev`, try running `pip3 install mariadb` again. If it still doesn't work, you can try setting the `mariadb_config` option in the `site.cfg` file as suggested in the error message. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a `site.cfg` file in the same directory where you are running the `pip3 install mariadb` command.
2. Add the following lines to the `site.cfg` file:

```
[mariadb_config]
mariadb_config = /usr/bin/mariadb_config
```

3. Save the `site.cfg` file and try running `pip3 install mariadb` again.

This should hopefully resolve the issue.
