The issue is that the `tf` module is not defined in the scope of the `Lambda` layer when you load the model. You can fix this by importing `tf` in the same scope as the `Lambda` layer:

```
from keras.models import load_model
from keras.layers import Lambda
import tensorflow as tf


def learning(test_samples):
    # Import tf in the same scope as the Lambda layer
    model = load_model('my_model.h5', custom_objects={'tf': tf})
    # rest of the code
```

By passing `custom_objects={'tf': tf}` to `load_model`, you are telling Keras to use the `tf` module when it encounters the `Lambda` layer.
