It seems like the file you are trying to download requires permission to access. You can try changing the sharing settings of the file to "Anyone with the link can view" or "Public" to allow access to the file without requiring permission. 

Alternatively, you can try using the Google Drive API to download the file programmatically. Here's an example code snippet that you can use:

```
import requests

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=0B1lRQVLFjBRNR3Jqam1menVtZnc'
response = requests.get(url)
with open('letter.pdf', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(response.content)
```

This code uses the requests library to download the file directly from the URL. Make sure to install the requests library before running the code by running `pip install requests` in your terminal.
