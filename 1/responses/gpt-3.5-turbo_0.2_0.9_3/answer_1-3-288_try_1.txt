You can use a for loop and increment the index by 1 each time through the loop. Here's an example:

```
my_string = 'teststring'
for i in range(len(my_string)-1):
    print(my_string[i:i+2])
```

This will output:

```
te
es
st
ts
st
tr
ri
in
ng
``` 

In this example, we use the `range()` function to generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to the length of the string minus 1. We then use this sequence to iterate through the string, slicing two characters at a time using the current index `i` and `i+2`.
