It seems like you have an issue with uninstalling the `wrapt` package. One solution is to force uninstall it using the `--ignore-installed` flag. Try running the following command:

```
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14 --ignore-installed wrapt
```

This should force the installation of `tensorflow-gpu~=1.14` and ignore any issues with the `wrapt` package.
