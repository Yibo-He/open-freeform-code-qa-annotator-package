It seems like there is an issue with removing the 'requests' and 'setuptools' packages from the conda environment. One solution to this problem is to create a new conda environment and install the required packages in the new environment. Here are the steps to create a new environment and install the required packages:

1. Open the Anaconda prompt or terminal.
2. Create a new conda environment using the following command:

   ```
   conda create --name myenv python=3.6
   ```
   
   Replace 'myenv' with the name you want to give to your new environment.
   
3. Activate the new environment using the following command:

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   ```
   
   Replace 'myenv' with the name of your new environment.
   
4. Install the required packages using the following command:

   ```
   conda install -c enigma catalyst
   ```
   
   This will install the 'catalyst' package along with its dependencies.
   
5. Once the installation is complete, you can deactivate the environment using the following command:

   ```
   conda deactivate
   ```
   
   This will deactivate the 'myenv' environment and return you to the base environment.
   
6. You can now use the 'catalyst' package in your Python code by activating the 'myenv' environment and running your code.

   ```
   conda activate myenv
   python myscript.py
   ```
   
   Replace 'myscript.py' with the name of your Python script.
