To filter the data by `TEST_STATUS` column where the value is "PASS TEST", you can use the following code:

```
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will return a new DataFrame that only contains rows where the `TEST_STATUS` column has a value of "PASS TEST".

If you want to group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and count the number of occurrences of each value, you can use the following code:

```
data_useless.groupby('TEST_STATUS').size()
```

This will return a Series object that contains the count of each unique value in the `TEST_STATUS` column.
