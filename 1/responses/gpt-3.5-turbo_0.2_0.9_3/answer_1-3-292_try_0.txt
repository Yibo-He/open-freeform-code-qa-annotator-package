Yes, there are several ways to extract the star logo from the image. One common method is to use image segmentation techniques. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Convert the image to grayscale.
2. Apply a threshold to the image to separate the logo from the background. You can use a global threshold or an adaptive threshold depending on the image.
3. Apply a morphological operation such as erosion or dilation to remove any noise or small objects in the image.
4. Use a contour detection algorithm to detect the contours of the logo.
5. Select the contour that corresponds to the star logo and extract it from the image.

Here is some sample code in Python using OpenCV library:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.png')

# Convert to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply threshold
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Apply morphological operation
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_ELLIPSE, (5, 5))
morph = cv2.morphologyEx(thresh, cv2.MORPH_OPEN, kernel)

# Find contours
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(morph, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Select the contour of the star logo
logo_contour = None
for contour in contours:
    if cv2.contourArea(contour) > 1000:
        logo_contour = contour
        break

# Extract the logo from the image
logo = cv2.drawContours(img.copy(), [logo_contour], -1, (0, 255, 0), 3)

# Display the result
cv2.imshow('Logo', logo)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Note that the threshold value and the morphological operation kernel size may need to be adjusted depending on the image.
