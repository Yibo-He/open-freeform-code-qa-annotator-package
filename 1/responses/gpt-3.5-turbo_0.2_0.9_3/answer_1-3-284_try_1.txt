The `%tensorboard` magic command is not a built-in command in Jupyter Notebook. It is provided by the `jupyter_tensorboard` extension. 

To use `%tensorboard` command, you need to install the `jupyter_tensorboard` extension first. You can install it using the following command:

```
!pip install jupyter_tensorboard
```

After installing the extension, you need to load it using the following command:

```
%load_ext tensorboard
```

Then, you can use the `%tensorboard` command to launch TensorBoard in Jupyter Notebook.

Make sure that you have the latest version of TensorBoard installed. You can install it using the following command:

```
!pip install --upgrade tensorboard
```

I hope this helps!
