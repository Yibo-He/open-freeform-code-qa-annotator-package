One possible solution to improve the performance of your query is to use subqueries instead of multiple joins. You can try using Django's `Subquery` expression to generate subqueries for each filter and then combine them using the `Q` object. Here's an example:

```
from django.db.models import Subquery, OuterRef, Q

filters = [
  {'trait': 1, 'class': [2, 3]},
  {'trait': 2, 'class': [6,]},
]

queryset = Description.objects.all()

for filter in filters:
  subquery = Expression.objects.filter(
    trait_id=filter['trait'],
    class_id__in=filter['class']
  ).values('description_id')
  queryset = queryset.filter(
    Q(id__in=Subquery(subquery))
  )
```

This code generates a subquery for each filter that selects the `description_id` of all expressions that match the filter. Then, it combines all subqueries using the `Q` object and applies the resulting filter to the `Description` queryset.

Another possible solution is to denormalize your data by adding a `TraitClass` model that stores the relationship between a `Trait` and a `Class`. This way, you can avoid the multiple joins and simplify your queries. Here's an example:

```
class TraitClass(models.Model):
    """
    Stores the relationship between a Trait and a Class.
    """

    trait = models.ForeignKey(Trait)
    class = models.ForeignKey(Class)

class Description(models.Model):
    """
    Stores the Descriptions. A description is a collection of Expressions.
    """

    name = models.CharField()
    protocol = models.ForeignKey(
        Protocol,
        help_text="reference to the protocol used to make the description;\
            this will define which Traits will be available",
    )
    entity = models.ForeignKey(
        Entity,
        help_text="the Entity to which the description refers to",
    )
    trait_classes = models.ManyToManyField(TraitClass)

filters = [
  {'trait': 1, 'class': [2, 3]},
  {'trait': 2, 'class': [6,]},
]

queryset = Description.objects.all()

for filter in filters:
  queryset = queryset.filter(
    trait_classes__trait_id=filter['trait'],
    trait_classes__class_id__in=filter['class']
  )
```

This code adds a `ManyToManyField` to the `Description` model that stores the relationship between a `Trait` and a `Class`. Then, it uses the `trait_classes` field to filter the `Description` queryset directly, without the need for multiple joins.

Note that denormalizing your data can have some drawbacks, such as increased storage requirements and complexity of updates. You should carefully consider the trade-offs before adopting this approach.
