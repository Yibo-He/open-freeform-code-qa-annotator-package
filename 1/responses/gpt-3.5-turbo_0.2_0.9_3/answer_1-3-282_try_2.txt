To install Python 3.7.0 in a clean environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the source code for Python 3.7.0 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

2. Extract the source code to a directory of your choice.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code.

4. Run the following commands to configure, build, and install Python:

```
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j8
sudo make altinstall
```

Note: The `--enable-optimizations` flag enables additional performance optimizations during the build process.

5. Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Python 3.7.0 is installed by running the following command:

```
python3.7 --version
```

This should output the version number of Python 3.7.0.

6. Finally, you can install any required Python packages using pip:

```
python3.7 -m pip install <package-name>
```

Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to install.
