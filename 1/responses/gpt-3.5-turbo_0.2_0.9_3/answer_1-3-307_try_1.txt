The error message you provided is not visible. However, here is an example of how to use the `OrderedModel` class from the `statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model` module:

```
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model import OrderedModel

# Generate some random data
np.random.seed(123)
nobs = 100
x = np.random.normal(size=nobs)
y = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2], size=nobs, p=[0.3, 0.4, 0.3])

# Fit an ordered probit model
model = OrderedModel(y, x)
result = model.fit(method='bfgs')

# Print the summary of the model
print(result.summary())
```

In this example, `x` is a vector of independent variables and `y` is a vector of dependent variables that take on three ordered categories. The `OrderedModel` class is used to fit an ordered probit model to the data, and the `fit` method is used to estimate the model parameters. The `method` argument specifies the optimization algorithm to use. Finally, the `summary` method is used to print a summary of the model results.
