The designer.exe file is usually located in the `Scripts` folder of your Python installation directory. You can try the following steps to locate the designer.exe file:

1. Open the command prompt or terminal.
2. Type `where designer.exe` and press Enter.
3. If the designer.exe file is installed on your system, the command prompt will display the path to the file.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling PyQT5 and PyQT5-tools using the following command:

```
pip uninstall pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
pip install pyqt5 pyqt5-tools
```

This should ensure that all the necessary files are installed correctly, including the designer.exe file.
