It seems like there might be an issue with the IPython kernel connection. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if the IPython kernel is running: Open a terminal and activate your virtual environment "da38". Then run the command `jupyter kernelspec list` to see if the IPython kernel is listed. If it's not, you can try installing it by running `python -m ipykernel install --user --name da38 --display-name "Python 3.8.5 64-bit ('da38':conda)"`.

2. Check if the Jupyter extension is enabled: In VS Code, go to the Extensions panel and search for "Jupyter". Make sure the extension is installed and enabled.

3. Check if the Jupyter server is running: In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Jupyter: Show output". If the Jupyter server is not running, you can start it by running the command "Jupyter: Start Server".

4. Try resetting the Jupyter kernel: In VS Code, open the Command Palette and search for "Jupyter: Select Kernel". Choose your "da38" environment and then select "Python 3.8.5 64-bit ('da38':conda)" as the kernel. If this doesn't work, you can try resetting the kernel by running the command "Jupyter: Restart Kernel".

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
