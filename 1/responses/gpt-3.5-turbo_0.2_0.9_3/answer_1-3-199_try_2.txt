The error message indicates that Chrome failed to start and crashed. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as incompatible versions of Chrome and Chromedriver, missing dependencies, or permission issues.

One thing to check is whether the Lambda function is running as root or as a non-root user. Running Chrome as root is not recommended and could cause issues. You can try running the container as a non-root user by adding the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
USER nobody
```

This will switch the user to the "nobody" user, which has limited permissions. You can also specify a different user if needed.

Another thing to check is whether all the necessary dependencies are installed in the Lambda container. You can try installing additional dependencies and see if that resolves the issue.

Finally, you can try running the Lambda function with increased verbosity to get more detailed error messages. You can do this by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` or `INFO`. This will output more detailed logs that can help diagnose the issue.

Overall, troubleshooting issues with Lambda containers can be challenging, but by checking permissions, dependencies, and logs, you should be able to narrow down the issue and find a solution.
