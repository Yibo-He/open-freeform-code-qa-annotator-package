One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which is useful when you have two infinite loops that need to run concurrently.

Here's an example of how you can use multiprocessing to run both scripts simultaneously:

```python
import multiprocessing
import financeData as fd
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import dataBase as db
import homepage as hp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a database object
    database = db.dataBase()

    # Create a financeData object to continuously update the database
    data_mining_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=fd.financeData, args=(database, 1600))
    data_mining_process.start()

    # Create a Dash app to display the data from the database
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

    # Run the Dash app
    app.run_server(debug=True)

    # Terminate the financeData process when the Dash app is closed
    data_mining_process.terminate()
```

In this example, we create a `multiprocessing.Process` object for the `financeData` function and start it running in the background. Then we create the Dash app and run it as usual. Finally, we terminate the `financeData` process when the Dash app is closed.

Note that you may need to modify the `financeData` function to make it work with multiprocessing. For example, you may need to use a `multiprocessing.Queue` to communicate between the two processes.
