The error message indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required by TensorFlow to run on GPU.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the `libcublas.so.10.0` file is present in your system by running the following command:
```
$ find /usr/local -name libcublas.so.10.0
```
If the file is not found, it means that the CUDA toolkit is not installed properly or the installation directory is not added to the system path.

2. If the file is found, you can add the path to the CUDA toolkit to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by running the following command:
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
This will add the CUDA library path to the system path.

3. Try importing TensorFlow again and see if the issue is resolved:
```
$ python3
>>> import tensorflow as tf
```

If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling the CUDA toolkit and TensorFlow. Make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully and verify that all dependencies are installed properly.
