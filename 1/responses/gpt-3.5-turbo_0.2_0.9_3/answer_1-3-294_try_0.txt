This error message suggests that there might be an issue with the `six` module. It's possible that the version of `six` being used by your script is not compatible with the version of the `google-api-python-client` library that you are using.

You can try updating the `six` module to the latest version by running the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade six
```

If that doesn't work, you can try downgrading the `google-api-python-client` library to a previous version that is known to work with the version of `six` that you have installed. You can do this by running the following command:

```
pip install google-api-python-client==1.7.4
```

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to investigate further to determine the root cause of the issue.
