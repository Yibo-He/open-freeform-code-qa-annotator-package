This error message suggests that there might be an issue with the installation of PyTorch or one of its dependencies. Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Try reinstalling PyTorch using the following command:
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch -f
```
The `-f` flag forces a reinstallation of the package, which might help if there was an issue with the initial installation.

2. Check that your Anaconda environment is activated. You can activate your environment by running the following command:
```
conda activate <env_name>
```
Replace `<env_name>` with the name of your environment.

3. Try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019. You can download it from the following link: https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#microsoft-visual-c-redistributable-for-visual-studio-2019

4. Check that your system meets the minimum requirements for PyTorch. PyTorch requires a 64-bit version of Windows 7 or later, and a CUDA-enabled GPU for GPU acceleration.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try installing PyTorch from source. Instructions for installing PyTorch from source can be found in the PyTorch documentation: https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch#from-source

I hope one of these solutions helps you resolve the issue and start using PyTorch.
