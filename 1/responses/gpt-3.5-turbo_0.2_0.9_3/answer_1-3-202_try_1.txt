It seems like there is an issue with removing the 'requests' and 'setuptools' packages from the conda environment. One solution could be to create a new conda environment and install the required packages in that environment. You can create a new environment using the following command:

```
conda create --name myenv python=3.6
```

Replace 'myenv' with the name of your choice for the new environment. Once the environment is created, activate it using the following command:

```
conda activate myenv
```

Then, install the required packages using the following command:

```
conda install -c enigma-catalyst catalyst
```

This should install the required packages without any issues.
