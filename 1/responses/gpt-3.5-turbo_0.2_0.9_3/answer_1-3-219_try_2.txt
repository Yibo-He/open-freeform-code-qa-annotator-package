There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that the Jupyter package is installed in your virtual environment. You can do this by activating your environment and running `conda list` or `pip list` to see if Jupyter is listed.

2. Try launching Jupyter Notebook from the command line instead of from within VS Code. Open a terminal window, activate your environment, and run the command `jupyter notebook`. This will launch Jupyter Notebook in your default web browser. If this works, then the issue may be with the VS Code integration.

3. Check that the Jupyter extension is installed and enabled in VS Code. You can do this by opening the Extensions panel (Ctrl+Shift+X) and searching for "Jupyter". If the extension is not installed, click the "Install" button. If it is installed but not enabled, click the "Enable" button.

4. Try resetting the Jupyter kernel. In VS Code, open the Command Palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and search for "Jupyter: Specify local or remote Jupyter server for connections". Select "Local" and then select "Python 3.8.5 64-bit ('da38':conda)" as the kernel. Then, open the Command Palette again and search for "Jupyter: Restart Kernel". This will restart the Jupyter kernel and may resolve the issue.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling and reinstalling both VS Code and Miniconda. Make sure to completely remove all files and folders associated with both programs before reinstalling.
