No worries, I can help you with that. Here's some code that should do what you're looking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the product name to search for
product_name = 'ABC'

# Create a list to store the rows that contain the product name
rows_with_product = []

# Loop through all the rows in the sheet
for row in sheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the product name
        if cell.value == product_name:

            # If it does, add the row to the list
            rows_with_product.append(row)

# Create a dictionary to store the cell values
cell_values = {}

# Loop through all the rows that contain the product name
for row in rows_with_product:

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Get the column letter for the cell
        column_letter = openpyxl.utils.get_column_letter(cell.column)

        # Create a key for the cell in the dictionary
        key = f'{column_letter}{cell.row}'

        # Add the cell value to the dictionary
        cell_values[key] = cell.value

# Print the cell values
print(cell_values)
```

This code should search for the product name 'ABC' in all cells in the sheet, and then copy the contents of every cell in the rows that contain the product name. The cell values are stored in a dictionary, where the keys are the cell references (e.g. 'A2', 'B2', 'C2', etc.) and the values are the cell values.

You'll need to replace 'example.xlsx' with the name of your Excel file. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
