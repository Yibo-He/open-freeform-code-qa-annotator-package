To import existing resources listed on a map, you need to use the `for_each` meta-argument in your resource block. Here's an example of how you can import the existing S3 buckets using the `for_each` meta-argument:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  #other configuration
}
```

To import the existing S3 buckets, you can use the following command:

```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
```

This command will import the `logs_bucket` as the `logs` resource in the `aws_s3_bucket.bucket` resource block.

You can repeat this command for each of the S3 buckets that you want to import. Make sure to replace `logs_bucket` with the name of the existing S3 bucket that you want to import.

Once you have imported the S3 buckets, you can apply the configuration to update the resources.
