It looks like the error is in your base.html template, specifically in the line where you are loading the bootstrap stylesheet. Instead of using a static file, you are linking to a CDN. 

Try changing this line:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/bootswatch/3.3.7/cerulean/bootstrap.min.css">
```

to:

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{% static 'css/bootstrap.min.css' %}">
```

This should fix the error and allow your templates to render properly.
