It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of psycopg2. One possible solution is to try installing it using pip instead of conda. You can do this by activating your conda environment and then running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

This will install the binary version of psycopg2, which should work on Windows.

If that doesn't work, you can try installing the non-binary version of psycopg2 using pip:

```
pip install psycopg2
```

This will install the source code for psycopg2 and will require a C compiler to build, so you may need to install additional dependencies.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try installing psycopg2 using the Windows installer from the official website:

Make sure to select the correct version for your Python installation (e.g. Python 3.8 64-bit).
