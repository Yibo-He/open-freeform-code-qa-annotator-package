The error message indicates that the `settings` module is not configured properly. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable is set to the correct value. In your case, it should be set to `first_django_project.settings`.

2. Make sure that the `settings` module is imported and configured properly in your `poppulate_first_app.py` file. You can add the following code at the beginning of the file:

```
import os
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'first_django_project.settings')
import django
django.setup()
```

3. Make sure that the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting in your `settings.py` file includes the `first_app` app. You can add it to the list of installed apps like this:

```
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    'first_app',
    # ...
]
```

4. Make sure that the `DATABASES` setting in your `settings.py` file is configured properly. In your case, you are using the default SQLite database, so the `DATABASES` setting should look like this:

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': {
        'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
        'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
    }
}
```

5. Make sure that you are running the `poppulate_first_app.py` file from the correct directory. You should be in the same directory as the file, or you can specify the full path to the file when running it.

6. Make sure that you have activated the virtual environment before running the `poppulate_first_app.py` file. You can activate the virtual environment by running the `source venv/bin/activate` command in the terminal.

If none of these steps work, you can try creating a new Django project and app from scratch and see if you still encounter the same error.
