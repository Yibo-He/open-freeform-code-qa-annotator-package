The error message you are seeing suggests that the PostgreSQL database is expecting an attribute called "Sequence" in the CSV file, but it cannot find it. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a typo in the column name, or a formatting issue in the CSV file.

One thing you could try is to check the formatting of the CSV file to make sure that the column names are exactly the same as what is expected by the database. For example, make sure that there are no extra spaces or special characters in the column name.

Another thing to check is the data type of the "Sequence" column in the CSV file. Make sure that it matches the data type of the corresponding column in the database table.

If you are still having trouble, you could try importing the CSV file into a temporary table in the database first, and then copying the data over to the final table. This can help to ensure that the data is formatted correctly and that the column names match up.

Alternatively, you could try using a different tool to import the CSV file into the database, such as the COPY command in PostgreSQL or a third-party tool like pgloader.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
