Yes, you can definitely run Homebrew on your MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has already released a version that is compatible with the M1 chip. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install various development tools such as Python, Node.js, and other packages. However, not all packages may be compatible with the M1 chip yet, so you may need to check the compatibility of each package before installing it.
