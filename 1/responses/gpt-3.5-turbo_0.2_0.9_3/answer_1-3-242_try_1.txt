No, you cannot directly convert the entire list to a string using the `str()` function. If you try to do so, you will get a string representation of the list itself, not the individual elements as strings.

To convert each element of the list to a string, you need to iterate over the list and call `str()` on each element. Here's an example:

```
roll = [1, 2, 3]
roll_str = [str(i) for i in roll]
```

This will create a new list `roll_str` containing the string representation of each element in `roll`. You can then use `roll_str` as needed in your program.
