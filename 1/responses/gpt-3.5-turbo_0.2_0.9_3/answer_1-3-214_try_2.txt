It seems like the issue is with the `join_axes` argument, which is no longer supported in Pandas 1.0. You can try removing this argument from your code and see if it works:

```
import pandas_profiling
from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

profile = ProfileReport(data)
```

If this still doesn't work, you can try updating your pandas-profiling package to the latest version by running the following command in your conda environment:

```
conda install -c conda-forge pandas-profiling
```

Then try running your code again. This should resolve any compatibility issues with Pandas 1.0. 

Alternatively, you can try using the `pandas.DataFrame.profile_report()` method to generate the profile report directly from your DataFrame:

```
data.profile_report()
```

This method is available in Pandas 1.0 and should work without any additional packages.
