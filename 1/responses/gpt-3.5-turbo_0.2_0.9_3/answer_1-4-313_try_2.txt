Yes, it seems that R 4.0 requires a newer version of `libc6` than what is available in Ubuntu 18.04. You can try upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 which has `libc6` version 2.31, which should be compatible with R 4.0. Alternatively, you can try installing R 4.0 from source, which may require additional dependencies to be installed. Here are the steps to install R 4.0 from source:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev
```

2. Download the R 4.0 source code from the R website:

```
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.0.0.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the source code:

```
tar -xzf R-4.0.0.tar.gz
```

4. Configure the build:

```
cd R-4.0.0
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-R-shlib
```

5. Build and install R:

```
make
sudo make install
```

After these steps, R 4.0 should be installed on your system.
