The error message is telling you that you cannot use a string as an index for a list. In your case, `a` is a list with one element, which is a string containing a JSON object. To access the `id` value of the JSON object, you need to first convert the string to a dictionary using the `json` module, and then access the `id` key of the dictionary.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import json

a = ['{"id":9,"name":"Foo"}']

# Convert the string to a dictionary
d = json.loads(a[0])

# Access the 'id' key of the dictionary
print(d['id'])
```

Output:

```
9
```
