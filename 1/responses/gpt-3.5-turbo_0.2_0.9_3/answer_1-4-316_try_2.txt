The error message suggests that the `sort()` function cannot sort a list. Instead, you need to convert the list to a vector before sorting it. Here's how you can do it:

```
# Convert list to vector
vector_text_data = unlist(list_text_data)

# Sort vector alphabetically
sorted_data = sort(vector_text_data)

# Print sorted data
sorted_data
```

This should give you the sorted list of letters:

```
[1] "b" "d" "e" "f" "h" "i" "m" "q" "y" "z"
```
