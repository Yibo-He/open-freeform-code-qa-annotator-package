It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of psycopg2. One possible solution is to try installing it using pip instead of conda. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running the following command:

```
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

This will install the binary version of psycopg2, which should work without any issues. Once you have installed psycopg2 using pip, try running your sample app again and see if it works.

If you still encounter the same error, you can try uninstalling psycopg2 and reinstalling it using pip. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
conda remove psycopg2
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

This will remove the conda installation of psycopg2 and install the binary version using pip.

If none of these solutions work, you can try installing psycopg2 from source. You can download the source code from the psycopg2 website and follow the installation instructions provided. However, this is a more advanced option and should only be attempted if the other solutions do not work.
