This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary location is not set or not found in the default location. To fix this issue, you can try the following solutions:

1. Install Firefox browser on your system if it is not already installed.

2. Set the Firefox binary location in your code using the `executable_path` parameter as shown below:

```
from selenium import webdriver
browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/geckodriver')
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Note: You need to download the geckodriver executable and provide its path in the `executable_path` parameter.

3. Add the Firefox binary location to the system PATH environment variable.

4. If you are using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it before running the code.

I hope this helps!
