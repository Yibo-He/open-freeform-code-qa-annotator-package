If the `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false` line is greyed out in your settings.json file, it means that the setting is being overridden by another setting. 

To find out which setting is overriding it, you can try the following steps:

1. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd+Shift+P` (macOS).
2. Type in "Preferences: Open User Settings" and select it.
3. In the search bar, type in "jediEnabled" to filter the settings.
4. Look for any settings that have "jediEnabled" set to `true` and try setting them to `false`.
5. Save the settings file and restart Visual Studio Code.

If you still can't disable Jedi, you can try disabling it globally by adding the following line to your settings.json file:

```
"python.jediEnabled": false
```

This should disable Jedi for all Python projects in Visual Studio Code.
