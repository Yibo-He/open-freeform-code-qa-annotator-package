The reason why Python returns `[15]` instead of an error is because `0x` is a valid prefix for hexadecimal numbers in Python. In this case, `0xfor` is interpreted as the hexadecimal number `0x0f` (which is equal to 15 in decimal), followed by the variable `x` in a for loop that iterates over the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`. Therefore, the expression `[0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)]` is equivalent to `[15, 15, 15]`, which is a list containing three elements, each of which is the value of the hexadecimal number `0x0f`.
