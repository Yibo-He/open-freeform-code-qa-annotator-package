Yes, you can try applying some image processing techniques to improve the accuracy of the OCR. Here are some suggestions:

1. Apply image dilation: You can try applying dilation to the binary image to thicken the characters and make them more prominent. This can be done using the `cv2.dilate()` function. Here's an example:

```
kernel = cv2.getStructuringElement(cv2.MORPH_RECT, (3,3))
dilated = cv2.dilate(gray_filtered, kernel, iterations=1)
cv2.imwrite("dilated.png", dilated)
```

2. Apply image smoothing: You can try applying some smoothing filters to the image to reduce noise and make the characters more distinct. This can be done using functions like `cv2.medianBlur()` or `cv2.GaussianBlur()`. Here's an example:

```
blurred = cv2.GaussianBlur(gray_filtered, (3,3), 0)
cv2.imwrite("blurred.png", blurred)
```

3. Try different thresholding methods: You can experiment with different thresholding methods to find the one that works best for your images. Some options include `cv2.THRESH_BINARY`, `cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV`, `cv2.THRESH_TRUNC`, etc. Here's an example:

```
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(gray_image, 100, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV)
cv2.imwrite("thresh.png", thresh)
```

4. Use image segmentation: You can try segmenting the image into individual characters using techniques like contour detection or connected component analysis. This can help isolate the characters and improve the accuracy of the OCR. Here's an example:

```
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
for cnt in contours:
    x,y,w,h = cv2.boundingRect(cnt)
    roi = gray_image[y:y+h, x:x+w]
    cv2.imwrite("char_{}.png".format(x), roi)
```

These are just some suggestions to get you started. You may need to experiment with different combinations of techniques to find the best approach for your specific images.
