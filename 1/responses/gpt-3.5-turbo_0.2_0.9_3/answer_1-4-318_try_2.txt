The "No FontName. Skipping." issue occurs when the font file does not contain the necessary metadata for `extrafont` to import it. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this issue, as it requires modifying the font file itself to include the necessary metadata.

Regarding the warning messages, they are related to the `ttf2pt1` utility that `extrafont` uses to extract font metrics from the font files. The warnings indicate that the utility encountered an error while processing the font files. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a corrupted font file or an issue with the `ttf2pt1` utility itself.

While these warning messages are not ideal, they do not necessarily indicate a critical issue with your system or the font files themselves. However, if you are experiencing issues with the imported fonts, it may be worth investigating these warnings further.

In summary, the "No FontName. Skipping." issue cannot be easily resolved, and the warning messages may or may not be cause for concern.
