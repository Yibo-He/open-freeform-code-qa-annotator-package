The error message suggests that the `cfcdae` package was installed before R 4.0.0 and needs to be re-installed. This could be due to compatibility issues between the package and the new version of R. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Uninstall the `cfcdae` package using `remove.packages("cfcdae")`.
2. Re-install the package using `install.packages("cfcdae_0.8-4.zip", repos=NULL, type="source")`.
3. Check that the package is installed correctly using `library(cfcdae)`.

If the issue persists, you can try updating your R packages using `update.packages(ask=FALSE, checkBuilt=TRUE)` and then re-installing the `cfcdae` package. 

Also, make sure that the package is installed in the correct library path for R 4.0.2. You can check the library paths using `.libPaths()` and make sure that the package is installed in one of the paths.
