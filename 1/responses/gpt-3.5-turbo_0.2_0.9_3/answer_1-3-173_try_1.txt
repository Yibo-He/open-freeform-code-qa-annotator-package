Yes, you can use the `pandas.Period` function to convert your datetime to a period object with a frequency of 'A' (annual). Then, you can access the `year` attribute of the period object to get the year, and use the `pandas.Period.range` function to generate a range of dates for the entire year. Finally, you can use the `len` function to get the total number of days in the year.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example datetime
dt = pd.to_datetime('2020-03-30')

# Convert to period object with frequency of 'A'
period = dt.to_period('A')

# Get year from period object
year = period.year

# Generate range of dates for entire year
year_range = pd.period_range(start=period, end=period+1, freq='D')

# Get total number of days in year
total_days = len(year_range)

print(f"Year: {year}, Total days: {total_days}")
```

Output:
```
Year: 2020, Total days: 366
```
