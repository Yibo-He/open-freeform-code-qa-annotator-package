You can achieve this by using the `cowplot` package to create a plot with two x-axes. Here's how you can modify your code to create the desired plot:

```
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
set.seed(321)
dat <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 18))
x <- c("Month", "Value")
colnames(dat) <- x
dat$Month <- rep(c(1,2,3,10,11,12),3)
dat$Value <- rnorm(18,20,2)

# Create a plot with a continuous x-axis
p1 <- ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = factor(Month), y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = NULL, y = "Value") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"))

# Create a plot with a discontinuous x-axis
p2 <- ggplot() +
  geom_blank() +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(3.5, 9.5), expand = c(0, 0), name = "Month") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"))

# Combine the two plots using cowplot
plot_grid(p1, p2, ncol = 1, align = "v", axis = "tb", rel_heights = c(1, 0.2))
```

This code creates two plots: `p1` is the original plot with a continuous x-axis, and `p2` is a blank plot with a discontinuous x-axis. The two plots are then combined using `cowplot::plot_grid()`, which places them on top of each other and aligns the x-axes. The `ncol = 1` argument specifies that the plots should be stacked vertically, and `align = "v"` specifies that the vertical axes should be aligned. The `axis = "tb"` argument specifies that the x-axis should be at the top of the plot, and `rel_heights = c(1, 0.2)` specifies that the height of the top plot should be 5 times the height of the bottom plot.
