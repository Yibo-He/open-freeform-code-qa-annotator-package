It seems like the Dockerfile is unable to find the `app` module. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure that the `app` folder is in the same directory as the Dockerfile. If it is not, you will need to adjust the `COPY` command accordingly.

2. Check the `main.py` file in the `app` folder. Make sure that the `FastAPI` instance is named `app`. For example:

   ```
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/")
   async def root():
       return {"message": "Hello World"}
   ```

3. Check the `requirements.txt` file. Make sure that all the required packages are listed and spelled correctly.

4. If you are using Docker Compose, make sure that the `build` section in the `docker-compose.yml` file is pointing to the correct directory. For example:

   ```
   version: "3.8"
   services:
     app:
       build: .
       ports:
         - "8000:8000"
   ```

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your project structure and Docker setup.
