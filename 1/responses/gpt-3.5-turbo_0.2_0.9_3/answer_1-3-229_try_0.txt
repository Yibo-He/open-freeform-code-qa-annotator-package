To find and replace text inside a single Jupyter cell in Visual Studio Code, you can use the following steps:

1. Click on the cell you want to edit.
2. Press the `Esc` key to enter command mode.
3. Press the `F` key to open the find and replace dialog box.
4. Type in the text you want to find and the text you want to replace it with.
5. Press the `Enter` key to replace the first occurrence of the text.
6. Press the `Alt+Enter` key to replace all occurrences of the text in the cell.

Note that this method only replaces text within the current cell and not in the entire Jupyter notebook file.
