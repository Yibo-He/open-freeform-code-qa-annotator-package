This error message indicates that the Firefox browser binary is not found in the default location. To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if Firefox is installed on your system. If not, download and install it.

2. If Firefox is already installed, try specifying the path to the Firefox binary in the code. You can do this by adding the following line of code before `browser= webdriver.Firefox();`:

   ```
   from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
   firefox_options = Options()
   firefox_options.binary_location = '/path/to/firefox/binary'
   browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=firefox_options)
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/firefox/binary` with the actual path to the Firefox binary on your system.

3. If the above steps do not work, try updating your Firefox browser and Selenium package to the latest version.

I hope this helps!
