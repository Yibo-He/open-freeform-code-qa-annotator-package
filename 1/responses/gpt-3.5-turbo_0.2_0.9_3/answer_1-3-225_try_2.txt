The issue with your code is that you are returning the first word after the first iteration of the loop. You need to move the return statement outside of the loop so that it returns the entire sentence after all the words have been transformed. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  new_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    new_words.append(word)
  return ' '.join(new_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this version, we create a new list called `new_words` to store the transformed words. We append each transformed word to this list, and then join all the words together with spaces before returning the final sentence.
