Yes, you can achieve this by using Streamlit's `beta_container` and `beta_columns` components. Here's an example implementation:

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

# Define your logo and title
logo = "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
title = "My Streamlit App"

# Create a container for the logo and title
header_container = st.beta_container()
col1, col2 = header_container.beta_columns([1, 3])
with col1:
    st.image(logo, width=100)
with col2:
    st.title(title)

# Create a sidebar with navigation links
st.sidebar.markdown("## Navigation")
pages = {
    "Home": Home,
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2
}
selection = st.sidebar.radio("", list(pages.keys()))

# Display the selected page
page = pages[selection]
with st.beta_container():
    page.app()
```

`Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("## Page 1")
```

Note that we've defined a `app()` function in each page file, which is called in the `Home.py` file to display the selected page.

With this implementation, the logo and title will be displayed on top of the navigation links in the sidebar. You can customize the logo and title by changing the `logo` and `title` variables in the `Home.py` file.
