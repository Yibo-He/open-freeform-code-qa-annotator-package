Yes, you can run Homebrew on your MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has been updated to support the new architecture, and many popular dev tools like Python and Node have also been updated to run on the M1 processor. However, not all packages may be available yet, so you may need to check the compatibility of specific packages before installing them. Additionally, some packages may require additional steps to install or may not work as expected on the new architecture. It's always a good idea to check the documentation for each package before installing it on your M1 MacBook Pro.
