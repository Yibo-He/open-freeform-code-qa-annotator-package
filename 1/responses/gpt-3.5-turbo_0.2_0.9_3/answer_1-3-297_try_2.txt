To import existing resources listed on a map, you can use the following command:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[<key>] <bucket_name>
```
Where `<key>` is the key of the map and `<bucket_name>` is the name of the existing S3 bucket.

In your case, you can use the following commands to import the existing S3 buckets:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"] cloudtrail_bucket
```
Make sure to replace `cloudtrail_bucket` with the actual name of the security bucket.

After importing the resources, you can apply the configuration to update the resources.
