Yes, it seems that `libc6 (>= 2.29)` is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. You can either upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 or 20.04 to install R 4.0 or you can try installing an older version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. 

To install an older version of R, you can try the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

This will install the latest version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. If you need a specific version of R, you can try adding the appropriate repository to your sources.list file. For example, to install R 3.6.3, you can add the following line to your sources.list file:

```
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/
```

After adding the repository, you can run the following command to install R 3.6.3:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base-core=3.6.3-1bionic
``` 

Note that this will only install the core components of R 3.6.3. If you need additional packages, you will need to install them separately.
