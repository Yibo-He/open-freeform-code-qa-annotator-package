It seems like the `mariadb_config` utility is missing on your system. You can try installing the `mariadb-connector-c` package which provides this utility. 

You can install it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev
```

After installing the package, try running the `pip3 install mariadb` command again. If you still face the same issue, you can try setting the `mariadb_config` option in the `site.cfg` file as suggested in the error message.

To do this, create a file named `site.cfg` in the same directory where you are running the `pip3 install mariadb` command and add the following lines to it:

```
[mariadb_config]
mariadb_config = /usr/bin/mariadb_config
```

Make sure to replace `/usr/bin/mariadb_config` with the correct path to the `mariadb_config` utility on your system. 

After adding these lines to the `site.cfg` file, try running the `pip3 install mariadb` command again. This should resolve the issue.
