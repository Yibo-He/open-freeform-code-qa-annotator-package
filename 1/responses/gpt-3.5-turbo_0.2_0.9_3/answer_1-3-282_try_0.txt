To install Python 3.7.0 in a clean environment, you can follow these steps:

1. Download the source code for Python 3.7.0 from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/

2. Extract the source code to a directory of your choice.

3. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted the source code.

4. Run the following commands to configure and build Python:

```
./configure --enable-optimizations
make -j8
```

Note: The `--enable-optimizations` flag enables some additional optimizations that can improve the performance of Python.

5. Once the build process is complete, run the following command to install Python:

```
sudo make altinstall
```

Note: The `altinstall` option installs Python 3.7.0 alongside any other versions of Python that may be installed on your system.

6. Finally, you can verify that Python 3.7.0 is installed by running the following command:

```
python3.7 --version
```

This should output the version number of Python 3.7.0.

After installing Python 3.7.0, you can use `pip` to install any required packages for your application.
