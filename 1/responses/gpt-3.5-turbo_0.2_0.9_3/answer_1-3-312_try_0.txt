This error message indicates that there is a problem with the `asmjit.dll` file that PyTorch is trying to load. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that your Anaconda installation is up to date. You can do this by running `conda update anaconda`.

2. Try reinstalling PyTorch using the following command: `conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch -f`.

3. Check if you have any conflicting versions of the `asmjit.dll` file on your system. You can do this by searching for the file using Windows Explorer and checking if there are any other versions of the file in other directories. If you find any conflicting versions, try removing them and then reinstalling PyTorch.

4. Try installing the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2019. You can download it from the Microsoft website [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/).

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try manually downloading the `asmjit.dll` file from the PyTorch GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/tree/master/torch/lib). Once you have downloaded the file, copy it to the `C:\Users\chunc\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\torch\lib` directory and try importing PyTorch again.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you resolve the issue and allow you to use PyTorch.
