It seems like there might be an issue with your pip3 installation. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling pip3 to see if that resolves the issue. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Uninstall pip3: `sudo apt-get remove python3-pip`
2. Reinstall pip3: `sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

After reinstalling pip3, try installing Jupyter Notebook again using the following command:

`pip3 install jupyter`

If you still encounter issues, you can try creating a virtual environment and installing Jupyter Notebook within the virtual environment. This can help isolate any potential conflicts with other packages. Here are the steps to create a virtual environment and install Jupyter Notebook within it:

1. Install virtualenv: `sudo apt-get install python3-virtualenv`
2. Create a virtual environment: `virtualenv myenv`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `source myenv/bin/activate`
4. Install Jupyter Notebook: `pip3 install jupyter`

Once Jupyter Notebook is installed, you can launch it by running the following command:

`jupyter notebook`
