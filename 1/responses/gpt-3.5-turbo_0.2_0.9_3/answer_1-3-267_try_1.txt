The error message you are seeing is related to TensorFlow's XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) feature. XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra operations, which can help improve the performance of TensorFlow models on certain hardware platforms.

To fix this error, you can try setting the `TF_XLA_FLAGS` environment variable to enable XLA. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Set the `TF_XLA_FLAGS` environment variable by running the following command:
```
export TF_XLA_FLAGS=--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices
```
Note: If you are using Windows, use `set` instead of `export`.
3. Run your `drive.py` program again and see if the error is resolved.

If the above solution doesn't work, you can try upgrading TensorFlow to the latest version or downgrading to a previous version that is compatible with your CUDA version. You can also check if your CUDA installation is correct and properly configured.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
