The error message you're seeing is because TensorFlow is looking for CUDA 10.0 libraries, but you have CUDA 10.1 installed. 

TensorFlow 1.13.1, which you have installed, is built against CUDA 10.0, not CUDA 10.1. This means that it expects to find the CUDA 10.0 versions of the libraries it needs, but it's finding the CUDA 10.1 versions instead.

To resolve this issue, you have two options:

1. Downgrade your CUDA version to 10.0. You can download it from the official NVIDIA website. After downloading, you need to install it and set up the environment variables correctly.

2. Upgrade your TensorFlow to a version that supports CUDA 10.1. As of now, TensorFlow 2.4.0 and above support CUDA 11.0, and TensorFlow 2.0.0 to 2.3.0 support CUDA 10.1. You can upgrade TensorFlow by running the following command:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu==2.3.0
```

Remember to replace "2.3.0" with the version you want to install.

Before you proceed with either option, make sure to uninstall your current TensorFlow installation to avoid conflicts. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
pip3 uninstall tensorflow-gpu
```

After you've done this, you can proceed with either of the two options above.
