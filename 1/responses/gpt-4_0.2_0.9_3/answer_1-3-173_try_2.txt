Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `is_leap_year` property of the `dt` accessor to determine if the year is a leap year or not. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a datetime series
dates = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']))

# Calculate the total number of days in a year
days_in_year = dates.dt.is_leap_year.map({True: 366, False: 365})

print(days_in_year)
```

In this code, `dates.dt.is_leap_year` returns a boolean series that is `True` for leap years and `False` for non-leap years. Then, `map({True: 366, False: 365})` maps `True` to `366` and `False` to `365`, effectively giving you the total number of days in the year for each date in your series.
