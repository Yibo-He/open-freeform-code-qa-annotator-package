The error you're encountering is because the list `a` contains a string that is formatted like a dictionary, but it's still a string. Therefore, you can't access it like a dictionary.

To solve this, you need to convert the string to a dictionary using the `json.loads()` function from the `json` module. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import json

a = ['{"id":9,"name":"Foo"}']

# Convert the string to a dictionary
dict_a = json.loads(a[0])

# Now you can access it like a dictionary
print(dict_a['id'])
```

This will output:

```
9
```

The `json.loads()` function converts a JSON formatted string into a Python object, in this case a dictionary.
