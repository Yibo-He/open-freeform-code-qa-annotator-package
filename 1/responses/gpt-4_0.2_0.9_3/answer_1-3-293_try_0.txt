The error you're encountering is because you're trying to access list elements using a string as an index. In Python, list indices must be integers or slices, not strings.

In your case, the list `a` contains a single string, which is a JSON formatted string. To access the 'id' value, you need to convert this JSON string into a Python dictionary first. You can do this using the `json.loads()` function from the `json` module.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import json

a = ['{"id":9,"name":"Foo"}']

# Convert the JSON string into a dictionary
dict_a = json.loads(a[0])

# Now you can access the 'id' value
print(dict_a['id'])
```

This will output:

```
9
```

This code works by first importing the `json` module, then using the `json.loads()` function to convert the JSON string into a Python dictionary. After that, you can access the 'id' value just like you would in a normal dictionary.
