The line of code you provided seems to be incorrect and should indeed return a syntax error in Python. The correct syntax for list comprehension in Python is `[expression for item in iterable]`. 

The expression `0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)` is not valid in Python. The `0x` is a prefix for hexadecimal numbers in Python, and it should be followed by hexadecimal digits (0-9 and A-F). 

If you're trying to create a list of zeros with the same length as the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, you should use `[0 for x in (1, 2, 3)]`. This will return `[0, 0, 0]`.

If the REPL is returning `[15]`, there might be an issue with your Python environment or the code might be different than what you provided. I recommend checking the code and your environment again.
