Your current code will generate a 16 character string, but it doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly 3 digits in the random part of the string. Here's how you can modify your code to ensure that:

```python
import random
import string

# Known characters
known_chars = "NAA3U"

# Generate 3 random digits
digits = ''.join(random.choice(string.digits) for _ in range(3))

# Generate 8 random uppercase letters
letters = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(8))

# Combine all parts and shuffle them to ensure randomness
result = list(known_chars + digits + letters)
random.shuffle(result)

# Join the list to get the final string
result1 = ''.join(result)

print(result1)
```

This code first generates 3 random digits and 8 random uppercase letters separately, then combines them with the known characters. The combined string is then shuffled to ensure that the digits and letters are randomly distributed in the string.
