The error you're seeing is due to a conflict between the pip version installed by your system and the one you've installed/upgraded manually.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. First, uninstall pip3:
    ```
    sudo apt-get remove python3-pip
    sudo apt-get autoremove
    ```

2. Then, reinstall pip3:
    ```
    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    ```

3. After that, check the version of pip3:
    ```
    pip3 --version
    ```
    It should show the version of pip installed.

4. Now, you can install Jupyter Notebook:
    ```
    pip3 install jupyter
    ```

5. To run Jupyter Notebook, use the following command:
    ```
    jupyter notebook
    ```

Remember, you should not use `sudo` with `pip3 install` because it can lead to permission and environment issues. If you encounter permission errors, it's better to use a virtual environment or use the `--user` option with pip3 install.
