Yes, you can use a loop to iterate over the list and replace the characters in each string. Here's how you can do it:

```python
list_names = ['!sdf?', '!sdfds?', '!afsafsa?', '!afasf?']

for i in range(len(list_names)):
    list_names[i] = list_names[i].replace('!', '').replace('?', '')

print(list_names)
```

This will replace the '!' and '?' characters in each string in the list. The `range(len(list_names))` is used to iterate over the indices of the list, so that we can modify the elements in-place. The `replace` function is called twice to replace both characters. The modified list is then printed out.

This will give you the output:

```python
['sdf', 'sdfds', 'afsafsa', 'afasf']
```

This way, you don't need to manually create and replace each variable. The loop does it for all elements in the list.
