Your code is almost correct, but it doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly 3 digits in the generated code. Here's a modified version of your code that ensures the generated code will have exactly 3 digits:

```python
import random
import string

# Known characters
known_chars = "NAA3U"

# Generate 3 random digits
digits = ''.join(random.choice(string.digits) for _ in range(3))

# Generate 8 random uppercase letters
letters = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(8))

# Combine all parts
combined = known_chars + digits + letters

# Convert the combined string to a list to make it mutable
combined_list = list(combined)

# Shuffle the list to ensure randomness
random.shuffle(combined_list)

# Convert the list back to a string
result = ''.join(combined_list)

print(result)
```

This code first generates the known characters, 3 random digits, and 8 random uppercase letters. Then it combines all parts into one string, converts the string to a list, shuffles the list to ensure randomness, and finally converts the list back to a string.
