In R, when you have two columns with the same name, you can select the second one by using its index. However, it's not a good practice to have two columns with the same name in a data frame. It can lead to confusion and errors in your code.

If you still want to select the second column named 'a', you can do it like this:

```R
d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column of the data frame `d3`.

If you want to select the second column by name, you can rename the columns first:

```R
names(d3) <- c("a1", "a2")
```

Then you can select the second column by its new name:

```R
d3$a2
```

This will select the column 'a2' from the data frame `d3`.
