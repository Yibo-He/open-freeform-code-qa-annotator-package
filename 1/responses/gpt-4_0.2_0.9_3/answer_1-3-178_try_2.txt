In Playwright for Python, you can select an option from a dropdown list by using the `select_option` method. You can specify the option by its value, label or index. In your case, you want to select by visible text which corresponds to the label.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
from playwright import sync_playwright

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)

    # select the option
    page.selectOption(new_selector, label='Banana')
```

In the above code, we are using the `selectOption` method on the page object. The first argument is the selector for the dropdown list and the second argument is the option to be selected. We are using the `label` keyword argument to specify the option by its visible text.

Please note that the `selectOption` method is case-sensitive and it also considers leading and trailing whitespaces. So make sure that the label matches exactly with the visible text of the option.

Also, the `selectOption` method will wait for the element to be present in the DOM, visible, and stable before performing the action. So, you don't need to use `waitForSelector` before `selectOption` unless you have a specific reason to do so.
