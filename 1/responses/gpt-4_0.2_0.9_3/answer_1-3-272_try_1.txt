The issue here is that the yaml.load_all function does not perform environment variable substitution. You can add this functionality by using the os.path.expandvars function, which replaces environment variables in a string.

Here is the modified script:

```python
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.load_all(stream)
for doc in docs:
    for k,v in doc.items():
        if isinstance(v, str):  # Check if the value is a string
            v = os.path.expandvars(v)  # Replace environment variables in the string
        print(k, "->", v)
    print("\n")
```

This script will replace ${PATH} with the actual value of the PATH environment variable in the yaml file.
