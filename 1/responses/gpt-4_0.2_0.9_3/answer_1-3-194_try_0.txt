You can use the `openpyxl` library to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is how you can do it:

First, install the library if you haven't done so:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to write your list of lists into an Excel file:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active

# Write the data to the worksheet
for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

# Save the workbook
wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

This code will create a new Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write your list of lists into it. Each inner list will be written into a new row in the Excel file.
