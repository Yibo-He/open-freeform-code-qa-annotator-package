The error message you're seeing is because Django is not properly configured before you're trying to import your models. 

In your `poppulate_first_app.py` file, you're setting the `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable and then calling `django.setup()`. However, you're doing this after you've already tried to import your models. 

You should move the lines where you set the environment variable and call `django.setup()` to the top of your file, before you import your models. 

Here's how your `poppulate_first_app.py` file should look:

```python
import os
import django
os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'first_django_project.settings')
django.setup()

import random
from faker import Faker
from first_app.models import *

# FAKE POP SCRIPT
fake_gen = Faker()
topics = ['Search', 'Social', 'Marketplace', 'News', 'Games']

def add_topic():
    t = Topic.objects.get_or_create(top_name=random.choice(topics))[0]
    t.save()
    return t

def populate(n=5):
    for entry in range(n):
        # get the topic for the entry
        top = add_topic()

        # create the fake data for that entry
        fake_url = fake_gen.url()
        fake_date = fake_gen.date()
        fake_name = fake_gen.company()

        # create the new webpage entry
        webpg = Webpage.objects.get_or_create(topic=top, url=fake_url, name=fake_name)[0]

        # create a fake access record for that webpage
        acc_rec = AccessRecord(name=webpg, date=fake_date)
        acc_rec.save()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Populating script!')
    populate(20)
    print('Populating complete!')
```

Also, I noticed a typo in your `populate` function. You're trying to create an `AccessRecord` with a field `namme`, but your model defines this field as `name`. I've corrected this in the code above.
