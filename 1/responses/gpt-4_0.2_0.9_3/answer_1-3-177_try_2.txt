The PyQt5-tools package does not include the Qt Designer by default. The Qt Designer is a tool that is part of the binary distribution of Qt. It is not included in the PyQt5 package or the PyQt5-tools package.

If you want to use the Qt Designer, you have two options:

1. Install the full Qt SDK: This includes the Qt Designer, but it's a large download and install. You can download it from the official Qt website.

2. Install the standalone Qt Designer: This is a smaller download and install, but it may not be compatible with the latest version of PyQt5. You can download it from the official Qt website.

Once you have installed the Qt Designer, you can find the designer.exe file in the bin directory of the Qt installation.

If you want to use PyQt5-tools, you can try to install it using the following command:

```
pip install pyqt5-tools
```

After the installation, you can find the designer.exe file in the Scripts directory of your Python installation. The path should be something like this:

```
C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonVersion\Scripts
```

Please replace "YourUsername" and "PythonVersion" with your actual username and Python version.
