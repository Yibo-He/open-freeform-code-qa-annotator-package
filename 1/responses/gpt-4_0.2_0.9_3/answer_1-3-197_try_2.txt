You can achieve this by using the itertools.cycle function which returns an iterator that produces elements from the iterable until it is exhausted, then repeats the sequence indefinitely. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import itertools

my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df['names'] = list(itertools.islice(itertools.cycle(my_list), len(df)))
```

In this code, itertools.cycle(my_list) creates an infinite iterator cycling over my_list. itertools.islice() then takes the first len(df) elements from this infinite iterator, effectively repeating the list until it fills the length of the dataframe.
