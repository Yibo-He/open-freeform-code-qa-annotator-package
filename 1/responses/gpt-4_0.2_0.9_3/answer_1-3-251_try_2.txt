The error message indicates that the `mariadb_config` utility could not be found. This utility is part of the MariaDB Connector/C package, which is a client library for C development.

To fix this issue, you need to install the MariaDB Connector/C package. On Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev-compat
```

This package provides the `mariadb_config` utility which is required by the `pip3 install mariadb` command.

After installing the package, try running the `pip3 install mariadb` command again. It should now complete without errors.
