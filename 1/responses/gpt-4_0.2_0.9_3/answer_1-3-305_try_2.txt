The issue you're experiencing might be due to a conflict between the packages in your environment and the version of nodejs you're trying to install. Here are a few suggestions you can try:

1. **Create a new environment**: Sometimes, the easiest way to resolve conflicts is to create a new environment and install the packages you need there. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n newenv
conda activate newenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

2. **Update conda**: If you're using an older version of conda, you might experience issues with package installations. You can update conda with the following command:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

After updating conda, try installing nodejs again.

3. **Specify the build**: If you know the specific build of nodejs you want to install, you can specify it in the install command like this:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba**: Mamba is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++. It's designed to be faster and more efficient than conda, and it can often resolve package conflicts that conda can't. You can install mamba with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

Then, you can use mamba to install nodejs like this:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

Remember to replace `14.4.0` with the version you want to install.
