Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this using `openpyxl`. 

Firstly, you need to install the `openpyxl` module. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to read your excel file and search for the specific string:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
wb = load_workbook(filename='your_file.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
ws = wb['Sheet1']

# The string you are looking for
search_string = 'ABC'

# List to hold rows with the search string
rows_with_search_string = []

# Iterate over the rows
for row in ws.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    # If the search string is in the row
    if search_string in row:
        # Add the row to the list
        rows_with_search_string.append(row)

# Now rows_with_search_string holds all rows with 'ABC'
# You can access individual cells in a row like this:
for row in rows_with_search_string:
    for cell in row:
        print(cell)
```

In this code, `rows_with_search_string` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the Excel sheet. Each element in the tuple is a cell in that row. You can access the value of each cell by iterating over the rows and cells as shown in the last part of the code.

Remember to replace `'your_file.xlsx'` with the path to your Excel file.
