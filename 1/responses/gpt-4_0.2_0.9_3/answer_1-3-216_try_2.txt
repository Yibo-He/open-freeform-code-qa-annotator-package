Yes, you can run Homebrew on a MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has been updated to work on Apple's new M1 chips. You can install it and use it to install other development tools like Python, Node.js, etc.

However, please note that not all packages available through Homebrew may be fully compatible with the M1 architecture yet. Some packages may still need to be run under Rosetta 2, Apple's technology for translating apps built for Intel processors to run on M1 processors.

For the most part, you should be able to use Homebrew and your tools as usual, but you may encounter some issues or limitations due to the new architecture. Always check the official documentation or forums for any tool you're having trouble with, as there may be workarounds or updates available to address compatibility issues.
