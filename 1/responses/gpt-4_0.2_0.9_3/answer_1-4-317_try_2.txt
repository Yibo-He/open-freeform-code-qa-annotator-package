The issue with your code is that you are not specifying which column to update in the `big` data.table. You can use the `:=` operator to update the `col` column in `big` with the corresponding values from `new_big` where the `id` matches.

Here is the correct code:

```r
big[new_big, col := i.col, on = .(id)]
```

This code performs a join on `id` and updates the `col` column in `big` with the corresponding values from `new_big`.

Let's break it down:

- `big[new_big, on = .(id)]`: This part performs a join on `id`. It matches rows in `big` with rows in `new_big` where the `id` is the same.
- `col := i.col`: This part updates the `col` column in `big` with the corresponding values from `new_big`. The `i.` prefix is used to refer to the columns of `new_big` in the join.

After running the code, `big` will be updated as follows:

```r
> big
    id col
 1:  B   1
 2:  C 103
 3:  D 102
 4:  E  11
 5:  F 104
 6:  G 111
 7:  H 104
 8:  I 104
 9:  J 104
10:  K 103
```

This is exactly the output you wanted.
