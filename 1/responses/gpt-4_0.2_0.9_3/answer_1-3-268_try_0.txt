The error 403 you're seeing is an HTTP status code that means "Forbidden". It's possible that the issue is related to the permissions of the file or directory you're trying to access. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the permissions of the tfevent file and the log directory. Make sure that the user running the Jupyter notebook has read and write access to these files.

2. Try to access the TensorBoard directly from your local machine instead of through Google Colab. You can do this by running the same commands in a local Jupyter notebook or in a Python script.

3. Try to use a different browser or disable the private mode. Some users have reported issues with TensorBoard when using Firefox in private mode.

4. Make sure that the path to the log directory is correct. If the path is incorrect, TensorBoard might not be able to find the tfevent file.

5. If you're running this in a virtual environment, make sure that the environment has access to the necessary resources.

If none of these suggestions work, it might be helpful to provide more information about your setup, such as the exact commands you're running, the full error message, and any other relevant details.
