The `relocate` function in `dplyr` is specifically designed for moving columns, not rows. However, you can achieve your desired output by using a combination of `slice` and `bind_rows` functions from `dplyr`. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(dplyr)

df <- df %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  bind_rows(df[1, ])

print(df)
```

In this code, `slice(-1)` removes the first row from the dataframe and `bind_rows(df[1, ])` appends the first row to the end of the dataframe. The `%>%` operator is used to chain these operations together in a 'pipe friendly' manner.

This will give you the desired output:

```
  ID var1 var2
1  2    b    1
2  3    c    0
3  4    d    0
4  5    e    1
5  1    a    1
```
