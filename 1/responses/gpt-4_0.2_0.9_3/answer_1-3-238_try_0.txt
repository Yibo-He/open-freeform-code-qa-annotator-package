The error message "Reverse for '' not found. '' is not a valid view function or pattern name." suggests that there is an issue with the URL routing in your Django application. Specifically, it seems like Django is trying to reverse a URL with an empty string as the view name, which is not valid.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your URL configuration**: Make sure that all your URLs are correctly defined in your `urls.py` file(s). Each URL should be associated with a valid view function or class-based view.

2. **Check your template files**: The error might be coming from a template where you are trying to reverse a URL using the `{% url %}` template tag. Make sure that you are providing a valid view name as an argument to this tag.

3. **Check your views**: If you are using the `reverse()` or `reverse_lazy()` function in your views or model methods to generate URLs, make sure that you are providing a valid view name as an argument.

Without access to your code, it's hard to provide a more specific solution. However, the error message suggests that the problem is likely related to the URL configuration or the way you are generating URLs in your templates or views. 

If you're still having trouble, please provide more details about your URL configuration and the places in your code where you are generating URLs.
