You can use the `data.table` join operation to replace the values in `big` with the corresponding values from `new_big`. However, you need to specify that you want to update the `col` column in `big` with the `col` values from `new_big`. Here is how you can do it:

```r
big[new_big, col := i.col, on = .(id)]
```

This command will join `big` and `new_big` on the `id` column and replace the `col` values in `big` with the corresponding `col` values from `new_big` (referred to as `i.col` in the join operation). 

After running this command, `big` will be updated as follows:

```r
> big
    id col
 1:  B   1
 2:  C 103
 3:  D 102
 4:  E  11
 5:  F 104
 6:  G 111
 7:  H 104
 8:  I 104
 9:  J 104
10:  K 103
```

This is exactly the output you wanted.
