Yes, there are several ways to extract a specific part of an image like a logo. Here's a general approach using Python and OpenCV, a popular library for image processing:

1. **Read the image**: First, you need to read the image using the `imread()` function.

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('x8Nbb.png', 0)
```

2. **Thresholding**: Then, you can apply a threshold to the image. This will convert the image to binary which will be helpful for the detection of the star.

```python
# Apply threshold
ret, thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, 0)
```

3. **Find contours**: After thresholding, you can find contours in the image. Contours can be explained simply as a curve joining all the continuous points (along the boundary), having the same color or intensity.

```python
# Find contours
contours, hierarchy = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```

4. **Filter contours**: Now, you need to filter out the contour that represents the star. This can be tricky and may require some trial and error. You might filter by area, by the shape, or other characteristics.

```python
# Filter contours
star_contour = None
for contour in contours:
    # Use some condition to select the star contour
    if cv2.contourArea(contour) > 100:  # This is just an example
        star_contour = contour
        break
```

5. **Create mask**: Once you have the contour of the star, you can create a mask and then use it to extract the star from the original image.

```python
# Create an empty mask to store the extracted star
mask = np.zeros_like(img)

# Draw the star contour on the mask
cv2.drawContours(mask, [star_contour], -1, (255), thickness=cv2.FILLED)

# Bitwise-AND the mask and the original image
star = cv2.bitwise_and(img, img, mask=mask)
```

6. **Save the result**: Finally, you can save the extracted star to a new image file.

```python
# Save the result
cv2.imwrite('star.png', star)
```

This is a very basic approach and may not work perfectly for all images. Depending on the specific characteristics of your images, you might need to use more advanced techniques, such as template matching, feature matching, or even machine learning.
