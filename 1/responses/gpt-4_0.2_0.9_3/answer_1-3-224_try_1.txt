Your last attempt is almost correct. The `filter` function in Python returns a filter object which is an iterator and can be converted to a list or iterated over in a loop to get its elements. 

Here is how you can modify your last attempt to get the desired result:

```python
my_set = ['LUNAUSDT', 'ETHBTC', 'ETHBNB', 'BTCUSDT', 'MANATUSD', 'ALICEETH' ]
my_final_set = list(filter(lambda x:x.endswith("USDT"), my_set))
print(my_final_set)
```

This will output:

```python
['LUNAUSDT', 'BTCUSDT']
```

This code works by using the `filter` function to filter out the elements in `my_set` that end with "USDT". The `lambda` function is used to check if each element ends with "USDT". The `filter` function returns a filter object, which is then converted to a list using the `list` function.
