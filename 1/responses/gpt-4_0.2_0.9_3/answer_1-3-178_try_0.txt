In Playwright for Python, you can select an option from a dropdown using the `select_option` method. This method can take a value, an index, or a label to select the option.

In your case, you can select the option "Banana" by its visible text like this:

```python
page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")
```

Here is the complete code:

```python
from playwright import sync_playwright
import time

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)

    # select the option "Banana" by its visible text
    page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")

    # at this point I have the element and can print the content
    handle = page.querySelector(new_selector)
    print(handle.innerHTML())
```

Please note that the `select_option` method is called on the `page` object, not on the `handle` object. The `new_selector` is passed as the first argument to identify the dropdown list, and the `label` parameter is used to specify the visible text of the option to be selected.
