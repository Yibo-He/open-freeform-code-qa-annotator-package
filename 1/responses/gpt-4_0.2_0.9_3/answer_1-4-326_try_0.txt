You can use the `stringr` package to replace the commas inside the quotes. Here is a solution:

```r
library(stringr)

string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

# Replace commas inside quotes
string <- str_replace_all(string, '(?<=\")([^"]+)(?=\")', function(x) gsub(",", "", x))

print(string)
```

This uses a regular expression to find all instances of text inside quotes, and then applies a function to replace all commas in that text. The `(?<=\")` and `(?=\")` parts of the regular expression are lookbehinds and lookaheads, respectively, which match the quotes but don't include them in the match. The `([^"]+)` part matches any text that isn't a quote.

Please note that this solution assumes that there are no escaped quotes inside the quoted text. If there are, you would need a more complex solution.
