The message "Not creating XLA devices, tf_xla_enable_xla_devices not set" is not an error but a warning from TensorFlow 2.4.1. This is because TensorFlow 2.4.1 has XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) support but it's not enabled by default. XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can further optimize TensorFlow computations.

However, this warning should not prevent your program from running. If your program is not running, the issue lies elsewhere.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your code for any errors. Make sure all the required files and dependencies are in place.

2. Ensure that your server is running correctly. The URL http://0.0.0.0:4567/ suggests that you are running a local server. Make sure that the server is started correctly and is not being blocked by any firewall or security settings.

3. If you are using a GPU, make sure that TensorFlow is able to access it. You can check this by running the following code:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
print("Num GPUs Available: ", len(tf.config.experimental.list_physical_devices('GPU')))
```

If the output is 0, TensorFlow is not able to access your GPU. You may need to update your GPU drivers or CUDA toolkit.

4. If you are still facing issues, please provide more details about the error or issue you are facing. The more information you provide, the easier it will be to help you.
