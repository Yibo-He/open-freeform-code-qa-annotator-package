The error message you're seeing is due to the Django process not having write permissions to the `/media/artists` directory on your Ubuntu system. 

In your settings.py file, you have set `MEDIA_ROOT` to `BASE_DIR / '/media/'`. This will resolve to an absolute path, `/media/`, not a path relative to your `BASE_DIR`. This is likely not what you intended, and could be the cause of the problem.

You should change your `MEDIA_ROOT` setting to be a path relative to `BASE_DIR`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
MEDIA_ROOT = BASE_DIR / 'media'
```

After making this change, you'll need to ensure that the Django process has write permissions to the `media` directory within your project directory. You can do this by changing the owner of the directory to the user that runs the Django process, or by changing the permissions of the directory to allow write access.

Here's how you can change the permissions of the directory to allow write access:

```bash
chmod -R 775 /path/to/your/project/media
```

Replace `/path/to/your/project/media` with the actual path to the `media` directory in your project.

If you're not sure what user is running the Django process, you can find out by adding the following line to one of your views, and then visiting that view in your web browser:

```python
import os
print(os.getuid())
```

This will print the user ID of the user running the Django process. You can then use the `chown` command to change the owner of the `media` directory to this user:

```bash
chown -R userid /path/to/your/project/media
```

Replace `userid` with the user ID you found out earlier, and `/path/to/your/project/media` with the actual path to the `media` directory in your project.
