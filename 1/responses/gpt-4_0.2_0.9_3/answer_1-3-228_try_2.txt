The error message indicates that TensorFlow is looking for CUDA 10.0, but you have CUDA 10.1 installed. The version of TensorFlow you installed (1.13.1) is not compatible with CUDA 10.1.

There are two ways to resolve this issue:

1. Downgrade your CUDA version to 10.0. You can download it from the official NVIDIA website. After downloading, you can install it using the following commands:

```bash
sudo dpkg -i cuda-repo-ubuntu1804_10.0.130-1_amd64.deb
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu1804/x86_64/7fa2af80.pub
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install cuda-10-0
```

2. Upgrade your TensorFlow version to one that supports CUDA 10.1. TensorFlow 2.1.0 and later versions support CUDA 10.1. You can upgrade TensorFlow using pip:

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu
```

After you have either downgraded CUDA or upgraded TensorFlow, you should be able to import TensorFlow without any errors.
