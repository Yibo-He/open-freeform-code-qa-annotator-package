The error you're encountering is because you're trying to access a list with a string index, which Python doesn't allow. List indices must be integers or slices, not strings.

In your case, the list `a` contains a single string that is formatted like a JSON object. To access the 'id' value, you need to convert that string into a dictionary first. You can do this using the `json` module in Python.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import json

a = ['{"id":9,"name":"Foo"}']
dict_a = json.loads(a[0])

print(dict_a['id'])
```

In this code, `json.loads(a[0])` converts the string at index 0 of list `a` into a dictionary. Then, `dict_a['id']` accesses the value of 'id' in the dictionary.
