The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that Jedi is not only a linter but also an autocompletion library. So, even if you have disabled it as a linter, it might still be running for autocompletion and other features.

Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Check if you have any other extensions installed that might be using Jedi. If you do, disable them and see if the problem persists.

2. Try to disable Jedi completely by adding `"python.jediEnabled": false` to your settings.json file. This will disable all Jedi features, not just linting.

3. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can switch to the Microsoft Python Language Server or Pylance, which are alternatives to Jedi. You can do this by adding `"python.languageServer": "Microsoft"` or `"python.languageServer": "Pylance"` to your settings.json file.

4. If none of the above works, it might be a bug. In this case, you should report it to the developers of the extension you're using.
