You can use the `matplotlib` and `forestplot` libraries in Python to create a forest plot. Here is a simple example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from forestplot import ForestPlot

# Define the studies, effect sizes, and confidence intervals
studies = ['Study 1', 'Study 2', 'Study 3', 'Study 4']
effect_sizes = [1.2, 0.8, 1.5, 1.1]
ci_lower = [1.0, 0.6, 1.3, 0.9]
ci_upper = [1.4, 1.0, 1.7, 1.3]

# Create a forest plot
fp = ForestPlot()
fp.add(studies, effect_sizes, ci_lower, ci_upper)

# Show the plot
fp.plot()
plt.show()
```

In this example, `studies` is a list of the names of the studies, `effect_sizes` is a list of the effect sizes (risk ratios), and `ci_lower` and `ci_upper` are lists of the lower and upper bounds of the confidence intervals, respectively.

Please note that the `forestplot` library is not a standard Python library and you may need to install it using pip.

```bash
pip install forestplot
```

If you want to add more features to your forest plot, such as a summary effect size, you may need to use a more advanced library or write additional code. The `matplotlib` library is very flexible and can be used to create a wide variety of plots and figures.
