Your idea of using Celery to run a separate process for the MQTT client is not a bad one, but it does come with some caveats. As you mentioned, Celery tasks are generally designed to be short-lived and not to run indefinitely. However, you can use a long-running task in Celery, but you need to be careful about how you manage it.

You could use a Celery task to start the MQTT client and then use Django Channels to communicate between the client and your Django application. This would allow you to send messages from Django to the MQTT client and vice versa. However, you would need to ensure that the Celery task is properly managed and restarted if it crashes or is terminated for any reason.

Another option would be to use a separate service to run the MQTT client. This service could be a simple Python script that uses the Paho MQTT client to connect to the broker and then communicates with Django via a REST API or some other method. This would allow you to keep the MQTT client running independently of Django and Celery, and you could use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to ensure that the service is always running.

In terms of integrating Django with MQTT directly, there are not many options available. Django is primarily a web framework and does not have built-in support for MQTT. You could potentially use a library like hbmqtt, which is an MQTT client written in Python, but this would still require running a separate service or process to handle the MQTT client.

In conclusion, while your idea is not a bad one, it does require careful management of the Celery task. A separate service for the MQTT client may be a more robust solution.
