The error message "No FontName. Skipping." means that the `extrafont` package is unable to find the name of the font within the font file. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the font file being corrupt or not being a TrueType font (.ttf) file.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check the font files**: Make sure the font files are not corrupt and are in the TrueType (.ttf) format. You can try opening the font files in a font viewer to see if they are valid and correctly formatted.

2. **Try different fonts**: If possible, try importing different font files to see if the problem is with the specific fonts you are trying to import.

3. **Reinstall the `extrafont` package**: Sometimes, reinstalling the package can help resolve issues. You can do this by running `remove.packages("extrafont")` and then `install.packages("extrafont")` in your R console.

As for the warning messages, they are related to the system command that `extrafont` is trying to run to extract the font metrics from the font files. The `status 1` indicates that the command failed, likely due to the same issue causing the "No FontName. Skipping." error.

If the above steps don't resolve your issue, it might be worth considering using a different method to use custom fonts in R, such as the `showtext` package, which can handle a wider variety of font formats.
