The circular import error is happening because `app.py` is importing `make_layout` from `first_view.py`, and `first_view.py` is importing `app` from `app.py`. This creates a circular dependency.

One way to solve this issue is to use a common pattern in Flask (the web framework that Dash is built on) where the `app` instance is not created in the script that is run to start the application, but is instead created in a function.

Here's how you can modify your code to avoid the circular import:

### app.py

```python
import dash
from my_dash_app.views.first_view import make_layout, register_callbacks

def create_app():
    app = dash.Dash(__name__)
    app.layout = make_layout()
    register_callbacks(app)
    return app

app = create_app()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

### first_view.py

```python
from dash.dependencies import Input, Output
import dash_core_components as dcc
import dash_html_components as html

def make_layout():
    return html.Div([
        dcc.Input(id='my-id', value='initial value', type='text'),
        html.Div(id='my-div')
    ])

def register_callbacks(app):
    @app.callback(Output(component_id='my-div', component_property='children'),
                  [Input(component_id='my-id', component_property='value')])
    def update_output_div(input_value):
        return 'You\'ve entered "{}"'.format(input_value)
```

In this setup, `app.py` imports the `make_layout` and `register_callbacks` functions from `first_view.py`, but `first_view.py` does not import anything from `app.py`, breaking the circular dependency. The `register_callbacks` function takes the `app` instance as an argument, allowing you to register the callbacks with the `app` instance after it has been created.
