The `random_state` parameter is used for initializing the internal random number generator, which will decide the splitting of data into train and test indices in your case. 

In machine learning, it's important to have reproducible results. By setting a `random_state`, you're ensuring that the data is split in the same way every time you run the code. This is useful for debugging and comparing models.

The number `42` is arbitrary, you could use any integer. It's just a convention from the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, where 42 is "the answer to the ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything". It's a sort of inside joke among programmers and data scientists.
