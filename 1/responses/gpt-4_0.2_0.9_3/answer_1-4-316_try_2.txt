The error you're seeing is because the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists of characters. However, you can use the `unlist()` function to convert your list back to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if needed.

Here's how you can do it:

```r
# Convert list back to vector
vector_text_data = unlist(list_text_data)

# Sort vector
sorted_vector = sort(vector_text_data)

# Convert sorted vector back to list if needed
sorted_list = as.list(sorted_vector)

# Print sorted list
print(sorted_list)
```

This will give you a list of characters sorted in alphabetical order.
