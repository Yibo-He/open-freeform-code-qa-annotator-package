In R, when you have two columns with the same name, you can access them using their index in the dataframe. 

In your case, you can access the second column named "a" in the dataframe "d3" by using its index. Here is how you can do it:

```r
d3[,2]
```

This will select the second column of the dataframe "d3". 

If you want to rename the columns to avoid confusion, you can do it like this:

```r
names(d3) <- c("a1", "a2")
```

Now you can access the columns by their new names:

```r
d3$a1  # for the first column
d3$a2  # for the second column
```
