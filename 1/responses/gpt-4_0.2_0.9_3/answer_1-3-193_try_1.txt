The error message suggests that Selenium cannot find the Firefox binary in its default location. This can happen if Firefox is not installed, or if it's installed in a non-default location.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. **Check if Firefox is installed**: Ensure that Firefox is installed on your machine. If it's not, install it and try again.

2. **Specify the path to Firefox binary**: If Firefox is installed in a non-default location, you need to specify the path to the Firefox binary in your script. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options

options = Options()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary"
browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_options=options)
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/firefox/binary"` with the actual path to your Firefox binary.

3. **Update Selenium WebDriver**: If you're using an old version of Selenium WebDriver, it might not be compatible with the version of Firefox you're using. Try updating Selenium WebDriver to the latest version.

4. **Update Firefox**: Similarly, if you're using an old version of Firefox, try updating it to the latest version.

5. **Use GeckoDriver**: Firefox requires a separate WebDriver called GeckoDriver. Make sure it's installed and added to your system's PATH. Here's how you can specify the path to GeckoDriver in your script:

```python
from selenium import webdriver

browser = webdriver.Firefox(executable_path='/path/to/your/geckodriver')
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `"/path/to/your/geckodriver"` with the actual path to your GeckoDriver.
