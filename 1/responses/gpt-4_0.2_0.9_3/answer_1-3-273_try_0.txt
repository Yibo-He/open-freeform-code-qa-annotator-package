The issue you are facing is quite common and can be resolved by following these steps:

1. First, make sure that you have installed `ipykernel` in your new environment. You can do this by activating your environment and then installing `ipykernel`:

    ```bash
    conda activate myenv
    conda install ipykernel
    ```

2. Next, you need to add your new environment to Jupyter. You can do this by running the following command:

    ```bash
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=myenv
    ```

    Replace `myenv` with the name of your environment. This command will add your environment to Jupyter.

3. Now, you should be able to see your new environment as a kernel in Jupyter Lab. If you still can't see it, try restarting Jupyter Lab.

Remember, you need to do this for each new environment you create. This process ensures that Jupyter is aware of your new environments and can use them as kernels.
