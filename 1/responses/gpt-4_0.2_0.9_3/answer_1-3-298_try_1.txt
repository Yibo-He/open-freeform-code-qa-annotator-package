The line of code you provided is not valid Python syntax and should indeed return an error. The correct syntax for list comprehension in Python is `[expression for item in iterable]`. 

The expression `0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)` is not valid because `0xfor` is not a valid Python expression. 

If you're trying to convert the numbers 1, 2, 3 to hexadecimal, you should use the `hex()` function in your list comprehension like this:

```python
>>> [hex(x) for x in (1, 2, 3)]
```

This will return `['0x1', '0x2', '0x3']`, which are the hexadecimal representations of the numbers 1, 2, 3.

If the REPL returns `[15]` for the code you provided, it's likely that there's a mistake or bug in the REPL you're using. It's recommended to try running the code in a different Python environment or updating your current environment.
