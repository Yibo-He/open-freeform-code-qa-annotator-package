You can use the `applymap` function in pandas which applies a function to a DataFrame that is intended to operate elementwise, i.e. like doing map(func, series) for each series in the DataFrame.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

This will apply the function to each element in the dataframe, not just a specific column.
