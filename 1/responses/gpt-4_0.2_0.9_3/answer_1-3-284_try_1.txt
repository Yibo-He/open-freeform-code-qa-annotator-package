The error message you're seeing suggests that the `%tensorboard` line magic function is not found. This is likely because the TensorBoard magic is not available in your current environment.

The TensorBoard magic was added in TensorBoard 1.14.0, and you're using TensorBoard 1.13.1. Therefore, you need to upgrade your TensorBoard to a newer version. You can do this by running the following command:

```python
!pip install --upgrade tensorboard
```

After upgrading TensorBoard, you should be able to use the `%tensorboard` line magic in your Jupyter notebook.

If you still encounter issues after upgrading, you can try loading the TensorBoard notebook extension explicitly with the following command:

```python
%load_ext tensorboard
```

Then you should be able to start TensorBoard with the `%tensorboard` command:

```python
%tensorboard --logdir {logs_base_dir}
```

Remember to replace `{logs_base_dir}` with the actual path to your logs directory.
