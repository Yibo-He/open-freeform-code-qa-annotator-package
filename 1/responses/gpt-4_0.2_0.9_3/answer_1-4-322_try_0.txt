Yes, you can accomplish this using the `tidyverse` package. The `split()` function is a base R function that can be used to split a vector into groups determined by another vector. Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyverse)

my_data <- tibble(list_names = c("Ford", "Chevy", "Ford", "Dodge", "Dodge", "Ford"),
                  list_values = c("Ranger", "Equinox", "F150", "Caravan", "Ram", "Explorer"))

desired_output <- split(my_data$list_values, my_data$list_names)
```

This will give you the same output as your `for-loop`:

```r
> desired_output
$Chevy
[1] "Equinox"

$Dodge
[1] "Caravan" "Ram"    

$Ford
[1] "Ranger"   "F150"     "Explorer"
```

The `split()` function is very efficient and should be faster than a `for-loop` for large datasets.
