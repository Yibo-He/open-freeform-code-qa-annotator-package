The error message you're seeing is because Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your system.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location.
3. The path to Firefox is not set in the system's PATH.

Here are a few solutions:

1. Install Firefox: If Firefox is not installed on your system, you can download it from the official Mozilla Firefox website and install it.

2. Specify the path to Firefox: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, or the path to Firefox is not set in the system's PATH, you can specify the path to Firefox in your code using the `firefox_binary` parameter:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options as FirefoxOptions
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.firefox_binary import FirefoxBinary

binary = FirefoxBinary('path/to/your/firefox')
browser = webdriver.Firefox(firefox_binary=binary)
browser.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

Replace `'path/to/your/firefox'` with the actual path to your Firefox installation.

3. Set the path to Firefox in the system's PATH: You can also add the path to Firefox in your system's PATH. The steps to do this vary depending on your operating system.

Remember to replace `'path/to/your/firefox'` with the actual path to your Firefox installation.
