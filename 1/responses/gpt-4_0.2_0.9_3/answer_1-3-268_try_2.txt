The error 403 you're seeing is an HTTP status code that means "Forbidden". This error is usually caused by a lack of file or directory permissions. 

In your case, it seems like the TensorBoard server is unable to access the log directory you specified. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the path: Make sure the path you provided to the `--logdir` argument is correct. The path should be the absolute path to the directory containing your TensorFlow event files.

2. Check the permissions: Make sure that the Google Colab environment has the necessary permissions to read the directory and its contents. If the directory or the files inside it are owned by a different user, or if their permissions are set incorrectly, you might see a 403 error.

3. Use Google Drive: If your event files are on Google Drive, you can mount your Google Drive in the Colab environment and then point TensorBoard to the appropriate directory on your Drive.

Here's how you can mount your Google Drive:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
```

After mounting, you can access your files under '/content/gdrive/My Drive/'. So, if your logs are in a directory named 'logs' in your Google Drive, you can start TensorBoard like this:

```python
%tensorboard --logdir='/content/gdrive/My Drive/logs'
```

4. Try a different browser: There might be an issue with your browser or its settings. Try using a different browser, or try disabling the private browsing mode.

5. Update packages: Make sure your packages are up to date. You can update TensorBoard with the following command:

```python
!pip install --upgrade tensorboard
```

6. Restart the runtime: Sometimes, restarting the Colab runtime can help. You can do this by clicking on 'Runtime' in the menu and then 'Restart runtime...'. After the restart, you'll need to remount your Google Drive if you're using it.
