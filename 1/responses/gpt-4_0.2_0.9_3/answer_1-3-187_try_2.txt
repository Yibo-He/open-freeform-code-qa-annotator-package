You can create a dictionary from the first four elements of `b` and `rest`, then use a list comprehension to replace the elements in `last`:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Create a dictionary where the keys are the first four elements of b and the values are rest
replace_dict = dict(zip(b[:4], rest))

# Replace elements in last using the dictionary
last = [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]

print(last)
```

This will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

In the list comprehension, `replace_dict.get(i, i)` will return the value from the dictionary if `i` is a key in the dictionary, otherwise it will return `i`. This means that only the elements in `last` that are in the dictionary will be replaced, the rest will stay the same.
