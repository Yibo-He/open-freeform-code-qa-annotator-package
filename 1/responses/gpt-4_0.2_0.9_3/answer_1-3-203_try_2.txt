The performance difference you're seeing is likely due to a combination of factors, including the M1 Max chip, the Python distribution you're using, and how you're running your code.

1. **M1 Max Chip**: The M1 Max chip is Apple's own ARM-based processor, and it's quite different from the Intel processors that most Python packages have been optimized for. This means that some packages may not run as efficiently on the M1 Max as they would on an Intel processor. However, many popular Python packages, including NumPy and TensorFlow, have been optimized for the M1 chip, so you should still be able to get good performance.

2. **Python Distribution**: The Python distribution you're using can also affect performance. Anaconda, for example, includes a lot of pre-compiled binary packages that are optimized for speed. However, these packages are mostly compiled for Intel processors, so they may not run as efficiently on the M1 Max. Miniforge, on the other hand, is a smaller distribution that's designed to be compatible with a wide range of systems, including the M1 Max. It doesn't include as many pre-compiled packages as Anaconda, but it should still provide good performance.

3. **Running Code**: How you're running your code can also affect performance. Running code from the terminal can be faster than running it from an IDE like PyCharm, because the IDE has to do a lot of extra work to manage the code and provide features like syntax highlighting and auto-completion. However, the difference in performance should not be too significant.

Here are some suggestions to improve your performance:

1. **Use Native M1 Packages**: Try to use packages that have been optimized for the M1 Max chip whenever possible. For example, you can install the ARM64 version of Miniforge, and then use it to install NumPy and other packages.

2. **Use a Lightweight IDE or Text Editor**: If you're finding that PyCharm is slowing down your code, you might want to try a more lightweight IDE or text editor. VSCode, for example, is a popular choice among Python developers.

3. **Optimize Your Code**: There may be ways to optimize your code to make it run faster. For example, you could use NumPy's built-in functions instead of writing your own loops, or use a library like Numba to speed up your calculations.

4. **Consider Using Cloud-Based Solutions**: If local speed is a concern, you might want to consider using a cloud-based solution like Google Colab or AWS SageMaker. These platforms can provide you with access to powerful computing resources, and they can be a good option if you're working with large datasets or complex models.
