In pandas, you can filter your DataFrame before grouping. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This will filter your DataFrame to only include rows where 'TEST_STATUS' is 'PASS TEST', and then group by 'TEST_STATUS' and count the number of occurrences.

However, since you're filtering to only include 'PASS TEST', the grouping by 'TEST_STATUS' won't really do anything because there's only one group. If you want to group by another column (like 'TEST_TYPE') after filtering for 'PASS TEST', you can do:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_TYPE').count()
```

This will give you the count of each 'TEST_TYPE' for the 'PASS TEST' status.
