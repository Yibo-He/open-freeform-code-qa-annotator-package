The problem with your code is that you are returning the word immediately after transforming the first word in the text. This causes the function to exit and not process the remaining words. 

Also, you are not storing the transformed words anywhere. You need to store each transformed word in a list and then join them into a string at the end.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

This code splits the input text into words, transforms each word into pig Latin by moving the first character to the end and appending "ay", and then joins the transformed words back into a string.
