The error message is indicating that Selenium can't find the Firefox binary in its default location. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Firefox is not installed on your machine.
2. Firefox is installed but not in the default location where Selenium is looking for it.
3. The path to the Firefox binary is not set in your system's PATH environment variable.

Here are a few solutions you can try:

1. Install Firefox: If Firefox is not installed on your machine, you can download it from the official Mozilla Firefox download page and install it.

2. Specify the path to Firefox binary: If Firefox is installed but not in the default location, you can specify the path to the Firefox binary in your script. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.options import Options
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

options = Options()
options.binary_location = "/path/to/your/firefox/binary" # replace with your path
driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=Service(GeckoDriverManager().install()), options=options)
driver.get('http://www.seleniumhq.org')
```

3. Set the PATH environment variable: If the path to the Firefox binary is not set in your system's PATH environment variable, you can add it. The process to do this varies depending on your operating system.

Remember to replace "/path/to/your/firefox/binary" with the actual path to your Firefox installation.
