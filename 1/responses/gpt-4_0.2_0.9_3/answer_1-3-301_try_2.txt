The error message you're seeing is because Django is not fully initialized when you're trying to import your models. This is because you're trying to import your models at the top of your script, before Django has been configured.

To fix this, you should move the import of your models inside the `populate` function, after Django has been configured. Here's how you can modify your `poppulate_first_app.py` script:

```python
import os
import django
import random
from faker import Faker

os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'first_django_project.settings')
django.setup()

from first_app.models import Topic, Webpage, AccessRecord  # Move this line here

# FAKE POP SCRIPT
fake_gen = Faker()
topics = ['Search', 'Social', 'Marketplace', 'News', 'Games']

def add_topic():
    t = Topic.objects.get_or_create(top_name=random.choice(topics))[0]
    t.save()
    return t

def populate(n=5):
    for entry in range(n):
        # get the topic for the entry
        top = add_topic()

        # create the fake data for that entry
        fake_url = fake_gen.url()
        fake_date = fake_gen.date()
        fake_name = fake_gen.company()

        # create the new webpage entry
        webpg = Webpage.objects.get_or_create(topic=top, url=fake_url, name=fake_name)[0]

        # create a fake access record for that webpage
        acc_rec = AccessRecord.objects.get_or_create(name=webpg, date=fake_date)  # Fix this line

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('Populating script!')
    populate(20)
    print('Populating complete!')
```

I also noticed a typo in your `populate` function where you're trying to create a new `AccessRecord`. You wrote `namme=webpg`, but it should be `name=webpg`. I've corrected this in the code above.
