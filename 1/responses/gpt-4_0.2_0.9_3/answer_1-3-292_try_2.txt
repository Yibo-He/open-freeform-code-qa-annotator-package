Yes, you can extract the star logo from the image using image processing techniques. Here's a general approach using Python and OpenCV, a popular library for image processing:

1. **Read the image**: First, you need to read the image using the `imread()` function in OpenCV.

2. **Convert the image to grayscale**: Since the star logo is in white color, it's easier to work with the image in grayscale. You can use the `cvtColor()` function in OpenCV to convert the image to grayscale.

3. **Thresholding**: Apply a binary threshold to the grayscale image. This will turn all pixels that are not black into white, effectively isolating the star logo.

4. **Find contours**: Use the `findContours()` function in OpenCV to find the contours in the image. The largest contour should be the star logo.

5. **Draw the contour**: You can then draw the contour on a blank image to get the star logo.

Here's a sample code:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read the image
img = cv2.imread('x8Nbb.png', 0)

# Threshold the image
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 1, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Create an all black image
output = np.zeros_like(img)

# Draw the largest contour on the black image
cv2.drawContours(output, [max(contours, key = cv2.contourArea)], -1, 255, thickness=cv2.FILLED)

# Save the output
cv2.imwrite('star_logo.png', output)
```

This code will save the extracted star logo as 'star_logo.png'. Please note that this is a simple approach and might not work perfectly for all images. For more complex images, you might need to use more advanced techniques.

Also, please make sure to install the required libraries (OpenCV and numpy) using pip:

```
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
```

If you're using Jupyter notebook, you can use `!pip install opencv-python numpy` to install the libraries.
