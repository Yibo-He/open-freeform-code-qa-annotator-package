The message "Not creating XLA devices, tf_xla_enable_xla_devices not set" is not an error but a warning from TensorFlow 2.4.1. It's related to the XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) compiler which is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can accelerate TensorFlow computations. The warning is simply saying that XLA devices are not being created because the environment variable `tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` is not set.

This warning should not prevent your program from running. If your program is not running, the issue lies elsewhere. 

If you're not seeing anything on `http://0.0.0.0:4567/`, it could be because the server is not starting correctly or there's an issue with the network configuration. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the console output for any error messages when you start the program. This could give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

2. Try accessing the server from `http://localhost:4567/` or `http://127.0.0.1:4567/` instead of `http://0.0.0.0:4567/`. The address `0.0.0.0` is a special address that means "all IPv4 addresses on the local machine". If a server is told to listen on `0.0.0.0`, it will be listening on all IPv4 addresses, but you can't necessarily connect to it using `0.0.0.0`.

3. Make sure your firewall or any other security software is not blocking the connection.

4. If you're running this in a virtual environment or a Docker container, make sure the network is correctly configured to allow connections to the server.

5. Check the code of the program to see if it's actually starting a server on port 4567. It's possible that the program is not working as expected or that there's a bug in the code.
