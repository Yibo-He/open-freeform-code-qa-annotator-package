The error you're encountering might be due to the fact that the `OrderedModel` is not directly under `statsmodels.miscmodels`. It's actually under `statsmodels.miscmodels.ordinal_model`.

However, as of the latest version of statsmodels (0.12.2), the `OrderedModel` is not available. The ordered probit model is not yet implemented in the stable version of statsmodels. 

You might want to use another package to build an ordered probit model. One such package is `mord`. Here is a simple example of how to use it:

```python
import mord
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate a random dataset
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=15, n_classes=3, random_state=42)
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an ordered probit model
model = mord.OrdinalRidge()

# Fit the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

Please note that `mord` package is not as comprehensive as `statsmodels` and might not have all the functionalities you need. If you specifically need to use `statsmodels`, you might want to check their development version or contact their support for more information.
