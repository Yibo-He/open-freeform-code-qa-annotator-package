The message "Not creating XLA devices, tf_xla_enable_xla_devices not set" is not an error but a warning message from TensorFlow 2.4.1. It's informing you that TensorFlow is not creating XLA (Accelerated Linear Algebra) devices because the environment variable `tf_xla_enable_xla_devices` is not set. 

XLA is a domain-specific compiler for linear algebra that can further optimize TensorFlow computations. If you don't specifically need it, you can ignore this warning.

If you want to enable XLA devices, you can set the environment variable by adding the following line to your code:

```python
os.environ['TF_XLA_FLAGS'] = '--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices'
```

You need to import the `os` module before setting the environment variable:

```python
import os
os.environ['TF_XLA_FLAGS'] = '--tf_xla_enable_xla_devices'
```

However, this warning is likely not the cause of your issue with the drive.py program. If you're not seeing anything at http://0.0.0.0:4567/, it could be a problem with the server setup or the network connection. You might want to check the server logs for any error messages or warnings.
