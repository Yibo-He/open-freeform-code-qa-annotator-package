Hello Rosalie,

It seems like you're having trouble with the new authentication requirements for Git operations on GitHub. No worries, I'm here to help.

Since you've already created a personal access token, you're halfway there. The issue might be that Git is still trying to use your old credentials (username and password) which are stored in your computer's credential storage.

Here's how you can update your credentials on your Mac:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Enter the following command to bring up the Git credential helper:

   ```
   git config --global --edit
   ```

3. In the text editor that opens, find the line that says `[credential]` and the line below it that says `helper = osxkeychain`. If these lines don't exist, you can add them at the end of the file.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Now, when you try to push to GitHub, it should prompt you for your username and password. Enter your GitHub username and, instead of entering your password, use the personal access token you created.

6. If it doesn't prompt you for your username and password, you might need to delete your old credentials from the keychain. To do this, open Keychain Access (you can find it using Spotlight), find the GitHub entry under login, and delete it.

After doing this, the next time you push to GitHub, it should prompt you for your username and password. Remember to use your personal access token as your password.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,
Your Assistant
