You can use the `conda list --size` command to list all packages along with their sizes. This command will display the size of each package in human-readable format (KB, MB, GB).

If you want to sort the packages by size, you can use the following command in the Anaconda Prompt:

```bash
conda list --size --json | jq -r '.[] | "\(.size.KB) KB \(.name)"' | sort -n
```

This command will list all packages sorted by size in ascending order. The `jq` command is used to parse the JSON output from `conda list --size --json`.

Please note that `jq` is not included in Windows by default. You can download it from https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/.

After downloading, add the path of `jq` to the system environment variable PATH.

If you don't want to use `jq`, you can use Python to parse the JSON output:

```bash
conda list --size --json > packages.json
```

Then, use the following Python script to parse `packages.json`:

```python
import json

with open('packages.json') as f:
    packages = json.load(f)

packages.sort(key=lambda x: x['size'])

for package in packages:
    print(f"{package['size']} KB {package['name']}")
```

This script will print all packages sorted by size in ascending order.
