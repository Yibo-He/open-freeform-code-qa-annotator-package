You can use the `idxmin` function to find the index of the minimum value in column B for each group in column A. Then, use `loc` to select these rows. Here's how you can do it:

```python
df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```

This will return the rows with the minimum value in column B for each group in column A.
