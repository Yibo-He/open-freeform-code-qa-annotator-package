You can use the `applymap` function in pandas which applies a function to every single element of the dataframe. Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will replace all values in the dataframe with 1 if they are greater than or equal to 25, and with 0 otherwise.
