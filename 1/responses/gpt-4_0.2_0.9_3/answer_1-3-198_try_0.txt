The issue here is that the URL you're using is a link to the Google Drive viewer, not a direct link to the file. To read a CSV file from Google Drive into a pandas DataFrame, you need to get the shareable link and replace the part of the URL that says `/file/d/` with `/uc?id=` and `/view?usp=sharing` with `&export=download`.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

google_drive_file_id = '0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28'
file_download_link = f'https://drive.google.com/uc?id={google_drive_file_id}&export=download'

df = pd.read_csv(file_download_link)
```

This will download the file and read it into a pandas DataFrame. 

Please note that this method will only work if the file is shared publicly. If the file isn't public, you'll need to use the Google Drive API to authenticate and download the file.
