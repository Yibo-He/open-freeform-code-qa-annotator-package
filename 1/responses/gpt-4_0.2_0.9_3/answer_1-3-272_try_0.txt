The issue is that the yaml file doesn't automatically interpolate environment variables. You need to manually replace them in your Python script. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.safe_load(stream)

for k, v in docs.items():
    if isinstance(v, str):
        docs[k] = os.path.expandvars(v)

for k, v in docs.items():
    print(k, "->", v)
```

In this script, we use `os.path.expandvars()` to replace `${PATH}` with the actual value of the PATH environment variable. The `os.path.expandvars()` function replaces variables in a string with their actual values.

Please note that `yaml.load_all()` is replaced with `yaml.safe_load()` for safety reasons. The `load()` function can create arbitrary Python objects, which can be a security risk if you're loading YAML from an untrusted source. The `safe_load()` function only creates basic Python data types like dictionaries, lists, strings, etc.
