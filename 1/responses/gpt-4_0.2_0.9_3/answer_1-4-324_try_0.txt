You can use the `strsplit` function in R to split the string by commas, and then again by colons to separate the keys and values. Here's an example:

```R
# Your data
data <- "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC"

# Split the data by commas
split_data <- strsplit(data, ",")

# Split again by colons to separate keys and values
split_data <- lapply(split_data, function(x) strsplit(x, ":"))

# Convert the list to a data frame
df <- do.call(rbind, lapply(split_data, function(x) {
  data.frame(name = x[[1]][2], Age = x[[2]][2], City = x[[3]][2])
}))

# Convert character columns to their appropriate types
df$Age <- as.integer(df$Age)

# Print the data frame
print(df)
```

This will give you a data frame like this:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
```

This code assumes that the order of the keys (name, Age, City) is the same for all rows. If this is not the case, you will need to adjust the code to match the keys with their values.
