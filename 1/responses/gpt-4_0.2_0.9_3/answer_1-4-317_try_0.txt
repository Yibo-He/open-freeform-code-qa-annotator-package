You can use the `data.table` join operation to replace the values in `big` with the corresponding values in `new_big`. However, you need to specify that you want to replace the `col` values in `big` with the `col` values in `new_big`. This can be done by using `:=` operator to assign the new values to `col` in `big`.

Here is how you can do it:

```r
big[new_big, col := i.col, on = .(id)]
```

This code will replace the `col` values in `big` with the `col` values in `new_big` for the matching `id` values. The `:=` operator is used to modify `big` in place.

After running this code, `big` should have the desired output:

```r
> big
    id col
 1:  B   1
 2:  C 103
 3:  D 102
 4:  E  11
 5:  F 104
 6:  G 111
 7:  H 104
 8:  I 104
 9:  J 104
10:  K 103
```

This shows that the `col` values for `id` values `B`, `E`, and `G` have been replaced with the corresponding `col` values from `new_big`.
