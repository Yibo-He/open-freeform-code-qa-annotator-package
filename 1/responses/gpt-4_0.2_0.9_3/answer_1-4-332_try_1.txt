In the tidyverse framework, there isn't a direct function like `relocate()` for rows. However, you can achieve the desired result by using a combination of `slice()` and `bind_rows()` functions from `dplyr`. Here is how you can do it:

```r
library(dplyr)

df <- df %>%
  slice(-1) %>%
  bind_rows(df[1, ])

print(df)
```

In this code, `slice(-1)` removes the first row from the dataframe and `bind_rows(df[1, ])` appends the first row to the end of the dataframe. The `%>%` operator is used to chain these operations together. 

This will give you the desired output:

```
  ID var1 var2
1  2    b    1
2  3    c    0
3  4    d    0
4  5    e    1
5  1    a    1
```

This solution is 'pipe friendly' as it uses the pipe operator (`%>%`) from the `magrittr` package, which is part of the `tidyverse`.
