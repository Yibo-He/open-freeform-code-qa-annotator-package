The problem with your code is that the variable `a` is not defined when the user enters a non-integer value. This is because the `int(input())` function throws an exception before the value can be assigned to `a`. 

To fix this, you should first assign the user's input to `a` as a string, and then try to convert `a` to an integer. If the conversion fails, you can then check if `a` is equal to "Done". Here is the corrected code:

```python
s = set()
print('Please type the number, when you are done please type "Done":')
while True:
    a = input()
    try:
        a = int(a)
        s.add(a)
    except ValueError:
        if a == "Done":
            break
        else:
            print('Integer only, please re-type:')
            continue
print(s)
```

In this corrected code, the user's input is first assigned to `a` as a string. Then, the code attempts to convert `a` to an integer. If the conversion is successful, the integer is added to the set `s`. If the conversion fails (i.e., if the user entered a non-integer value), the code checks if `a` is equal to "Done". If `a` is "Done", the loop breaks. If `a` is not "Done", the code prints a message asking the user to re-enter an integer, and then continues to the next iteration of the loop.
