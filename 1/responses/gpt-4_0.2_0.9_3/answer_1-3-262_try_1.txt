The error you're seeing is because the pip3 executable is trying to call a module that has been upgraded and is no longer callable in the way it expects.

The steps you've taken to remove and reinstall pip3 should have resolved the issue. After doing so, you should be able to use pip3 to install other libraries.

If you're still having issues, you can try installing pip for your local user only, which can help avoid conflicts with system packages. You can do this with the following command:

```
python3 -m pip install --user --upgrade pip
```

After that, you can install Jupyter Notebook using the following command:

```
python3 -m pip install --user jupyter
```

This will install Jupyter Notebook for your local user only, which should help avoid any conflicts with system packages.
