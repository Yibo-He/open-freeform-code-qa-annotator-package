The correct syntax to import a resource that is created using `for_each` in Terraform is to use the key of the map in the import command. In your case, you should use:

```
terraform import 'aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"]' logs_bucket
terraform import 'aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"]' cloudtrail_bucket
```

The key should be enclosed in double quotes and the entire resource address should be enclosed in single quotes. The second argument to the `terraform import` command is the ID of the resource in AWS. 

Please make sure that you have the correct permissions to access the S3 buckets and that the bucket names are correct.
