The issue might be due to the fact that the newline characters in your PDF content are not exactly "\r\n". They might be just "\n" or "\r" or even "\r\n\r\n" etc.

You can try replacing each of them separately:

```python
from tika import parser

filename = 'myfile.pdf'
raw = parser.from_file(filename)
content = raw['content']
content = content.replace("\r", "").replace("\n", "")
print(content)
```

This will remove all "\r" and "\n" characters from your content.

If you want to replace multiple consecutive newline characters with a single space, you can use the `re` module:

```python
import re
from tika import parser

filename = 'myfile.pdf'
raw = parser.from_file(filename)
content = raw['content']
content = re.sub('\s+', ' ', content)
print(content)
```

This will replace one or more whitespace characters (including `\n`, `\r`, and spaces) with a single space.
