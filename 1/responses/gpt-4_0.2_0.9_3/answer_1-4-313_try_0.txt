The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that R 4.0 has dependencies that are not available in Ubuntu 18.04's repositories. Upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 would likely solve the problem, as it has newer versions of the required libraries.

However, if you prefer to stay on Ubuntu 18.04, you can try installing R 4.0 from a different source that has been compiled with older dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, remove any existing R installation:

```
sudo apt remove r-base r-base-core r-recommended r-base-dev
```

2. Then, add the CRAN repository to your sources.list file:

```
sudo echo "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

3. Add the CRAN GPG key, which is used to sign the R packages:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

4. Update your system:

```
sudo apt update
```

5. Finally, install R:

```
sudo apt install r-base
```

This should install R 4.0 on your Ubuntu 18.04 system. If you still encounter problems, it may be necessary to upgrade your Ubuntu version.
