The issue you're experiencing might be due to a conflict between the packages in your environment and the version of nodejs you're trying to install. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Create a new environment**: You can create a new conda environment and install nodejs there. This can help avoid conflicts with other packages. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n newenv
conda activate newenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

2. **Update conda**: Sometimes, the issue might be due to an outdated version of conda. You can update conda using the following command:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

After updating conda, try installing nodejs again.

3. **Explicitly specify the build**: You can also try to explicitly specify the build of nodejs you want to install. For example:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try using mamba, a reimplementation of conda that is designed to handle environment solving more efficiently. You can install mamba in your base environment with:

```bash
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Then, you can use mamba to install nodejs:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

Remember to replace `newenv` with the name you want for your new environment.
