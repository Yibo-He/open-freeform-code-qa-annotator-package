The error message suggests that the package was installed under an older version of R and needs to be reinstalled under the current version. However, you've already tried reinstalling the package and it didn't solve the problem.

The packages you're trying to install are quite old and may not be compatible with the newer version of R you're using. The `cfcdae` package was last updated in 2012 and the `Stats5303lib` package was last updated in 2011. They may not work with R 4.0.2.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Downgrade your R version**: You can try installing an older version of R that's compatible with the packages. However, this might not be the best solution if you're using other packages that require a newer version of R.

2. **Check for updated versions of the packages**: The packages might have been updated under a different name or incorporated into other packages. You can try searching for them on CRAN or Bioconductor.

3. **Contact the package maintainers**: You can try contacting the package maintainers for help. They might be able to provide updated versions of the packages or suggest alternatives.

4. **Update the packages yourself**: If you're comfortable with R programming, you can try updating the packages yourself. This would involve fixing any errors and making sure the packages are compatible with the current version of R. However, this could be quite time-consuming and might not be feasible if you're not familiar with the package code.

5. **Find alternatives**: If you can't get the packages to work, you might need to find alternative packages that provide the same or similar functionality. You can search for alternatives on CRAN or Bioconductor, or ask for recommendations on R forums or Stack Overflow.
