The error message indicates that the `collections_abc` attribute cannot be found in the `six.moves` module. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **Version Mismatch**: There might be a version mismatch between the `six` module and the `google-api-python-client` module. The `collections_abc` attribute was added in a certain version of `six`, so if you are using an older version, you might encounter this error.

2. **Environment Issue**: The environment in which your Airflow is running might have changed. This could be due to an update or installation of another package that has altered the Python environment.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Check the version of `six`**: You can do this by running `pip show six` in your Airflow environment. If the version is older than 1.13.0, you should upgrade it by running `pip install --upgrade six`.

2. **Check the version of `google-api-python-client`**: Similarly, run `pip show google-api-python-client` to check its version. If it's not the latest, consider upgrading it.

3. **Reinstall the packages**: If the versions are correct, try reinstalling both packages. Uninstall them first with `pip uninstall six google-api-python-client`, and then reinstall them with `pip install six google-api-python-client`.

4. **Isolate the environment**: If the problem persists, consider using a virtual environment to isolate your Airflow environment from the rest of your system. This can help prevent conflicts between packages.

5. **Check for changes in your Airflow environment**: If none of the above solutions work, check if there have been any changes to your Airflow environment. This could be updates, new packages, or changes in configuration.
