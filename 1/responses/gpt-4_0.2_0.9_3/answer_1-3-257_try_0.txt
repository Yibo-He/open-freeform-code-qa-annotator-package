The issue with your code is that it's distributing the remainder one by one to each group. To distribute the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession, you need to modify your function. Here's a modified version of your function that should work:

```python
def split(a, b):
    quotient, remainder = divmod(a, b)
    result = [quotient] * b
    for i in range(0, remainder, 2):
        result[i % b] += 2
    return result

num = 100
parts = num // 30
print(split(num, parts))
```

In this function, `divmod(a, b)` returns the quotient and the remainder of the division `a // b`. Then, we create a list `result` with `b` elements, each of which is `quotient`. After that, we distribute the remainder by adding 2 to each group in succession. The expression `i % b` ensures that we go back to the first group when we've added 2 to all groups.
