The PyQt5-tools package includes the PyQt5 designer, but it's not added to the PATH by default, so you have to find it manually. 

The location of the designer.exe file depends on your Python version and the location of your Python installation. 

Here is a general way to find it:

1. Open Python in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Import the `site` module.
3. Print the site packages path.

Here is the code:

```python
import site
print(site.getsitepackages())
```

This will print out the path to your site-packages folder. 

The `designer.exe` should be in a path similar to this: `Lib\site-packages\pyqt5_tools\Qt\bin\designer.exe` inside your Python installation directory.

If you still can't find it, it's possible that the PyQt5-tools package didn't install correctly. In that case, you might want to try reinstalling it.
