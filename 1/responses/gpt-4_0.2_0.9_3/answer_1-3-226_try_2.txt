You can achieve this by using the `partition` function in Python. The `partition` function returns a tuple that includes the separator (the text that we are splitting on), the first half and the second half of the string.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
def split_string(s):
    _, _, after = s.partition('_')
    return after if _ else s

print(split_string('testing_abc')) # abc
print(split_string('xyz')) # xyz
print(split_string('testing_abc_bbc')) # abc_bbc
```

In this function, we are splitting the string on the first `_` character. If the string contains `_`, then the function will return everything after the `_`. If the string does not contain `_`, then the function will return the original string.
