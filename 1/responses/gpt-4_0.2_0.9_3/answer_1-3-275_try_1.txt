From the code you've shared, it seems like you're trying to create a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with 6 tasks in Apache Airflow. The tasks are supposed to run in a specific order, with some tasks running in parallel.

However, you didn't provide the error message you're encountering, which makes it difficult to diagnose the problem. Here are a few common issues that might be causing your error:

1. **Incorrect Connection ID**: Ensure that the `databricks_conn_id` you're using is correctly set up in your Airflow connections.

2. **Incorrect Cluster ID**: The `existing_cluster_id` is being fetched from the DAG run configuration. Make sure that the `clusterId` is correctly specified in the configuration when triggering the DAG run.

3. **Incorrect JAR paths or Main Class Names**: The paths to the JAR files and the main class names specified in the `spark_jar_task` dictionary should be correct. If there's a typo or if the files don't exist at the specified paths, it would lead to an error.

4. **Incorrect DAG Definition**: The way you're setting the DAG for each task and defining the order of tasks is unconventional. Usually, you would pass the `dag` argument when creating the task, like so:

```python
task_1 = DatabricksSubmitRunOperator(
    task_id='task_1',
    dag=dag,
    # other arguments...
)
```

And you would define the order of tasks using the `>>` and `<<` operators, like so:

```python
task_1 >> task_2 >> task_3 >> task_4 >> task_5 >> task_6
```

If you could provide the error message you're seeing, I could give a more specific solution.
