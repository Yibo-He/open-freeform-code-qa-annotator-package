The error message `Reverse for '' not found. '' is not a valid view function or pattern name.` suggests that there is an issue with the use of Django's `reverse` function in your templates or views. The `reverse` function is used to generate URLs by using the name of the view.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. **Check your URL configuration:** Make sure that all your views are correctly mapped to a URL pattern in your `urls.py` file and that each URL pattern has a unique name. The name you use in the `reverse` function should match exactly with the name in your URL configuration.

2. **Check your template files:** Look for any use of the `{% url %}` template tag. This tag also uses the `reverse` function under the hood. Make sure that the view name you are passing to the `{% url %}` tag matches with the name in your URL configuration.

3. **Check your views:** If you are using the `reverse` function in your views, make sure that the view name you are passing to the `reverse` function matches with the name in your URL configuration.

Without seeing the actual code, it's hard to pinpoint the exact issue. But the error message suggests that the `reverse` function is being called with an empty string as the view name, which is why it's not able to find a matching URL pattern. You need to find where this is happening and correct it.
