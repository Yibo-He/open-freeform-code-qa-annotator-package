The error message suggests that the file you are trying to download from Google Drive does not have the necessary permissions set for public access. 

However, if you are able to access the file manually without any issues, it might be a problem with the way the gdown package is trying to access the file.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the file permissions on Google Drive**: Make sure the file is set to be accessible by "Anyone with the link". You can change this setting by right-clicking on the file in Google Drive, selecting "Get shareable link", and then ensuring that the link sharing setting is set to "Anyone with the link can view". 

2. **Try using the 'share' link instead of the 'uc' link**: The 'uc' link is used for direct downloads, but it might be causing issues with the gdown package. Try using the 'share' link instead. You can get this link by right-clicking on the file in Google Drive and selecting "Get shareable link". The link should look something like this: 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing'. You can extract the FILE_ID from this link and use it in your code like this:

```python
import gdown
url='https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID'
output='letter.pdf'
gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)
```

3. **Try running your script with elevated permissions**: Sometimes, the issue might be with your script not having the necessary permissions to write the downloaded file to disk. Try running your script with elevated permissions (e.g., using `sudo` on Linux).

4. **Check if gdown is updated**: Make sure you are using the latest version of gdown. You can update it using pip:

```bash
pip install gdown --upgrade
```

If none of these solutions work, the issue might be with the gdown package itself. In that case, you might want to consider using a different method to download files from Google Drive in your Python script, such as the Google Drive API.
