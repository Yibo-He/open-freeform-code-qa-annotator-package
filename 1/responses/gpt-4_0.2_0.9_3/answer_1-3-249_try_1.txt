Your current code generates a 16-character string where the first 5 characters are "NAA3U" and the remaining 11 characters are randomly chosen from uppercase letters and digits. However, it doesn't guarantee that there will be exactly 3 digits in the entire string.

Here is a Python code snippet that ensures the generated code has exactly 3 digits:

```python
import random
import string

# Known characters
known_chars = "NAA3U"

# Generate 3 random digits
digits = ''.join(random.choice(string.digits) for _ in range(3))

# Generate 8 random uppercase letters
letters = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_uppercase) for _ in range(8))

# Combine all parts
combined = known_chars + digits + letters

# Convert to list to allow shuffling
combined_list = list(combined)

# Shuffle to ensure randomness
random.shuffle(combined_list)

# Convert back to string
result = ''.join(combined_list)

print(result)
```

This code first generates the known characters, 3 random digits, and 8 random uppercase letters separately. Then it combines them, shuffles the combined string to ensure randomness, and finally converts it back to a string.
