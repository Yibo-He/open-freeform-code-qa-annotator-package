Yes, you can extract the star logo from the image using image processing techniques. Here's a general approach using Python and OpenCV, a popular library for image processing:

1. **Read the image**: Use `cv2.imread()` to read the image.

2. **Convert the image to grayscale**: Use `cv2.cvtColor()` to convert the image to grayscale. This is because the operations we're going to perform don't require color information.

3. **Thresholding**: Apply a binary threshold using `cv2.threshold()`. This will make the image black and white, which will help in detecting the contours.

4. **Find contours**: Use `cv2.findContours()` to find the contours in the image. This will return a list of all the contours detected in the image.

5. **Filter contours**: Iterate over the list of contours and filter out the ones that don't meet certain criteria. In your case, you might want to keep only the contours that have a shape similar to a star.

6. **Draw contours**: Use `cv2.drawContours()` to draw the filtered contours on a blank image. This will give you an image with only the star logo.

Here's a basic code snippet that implements the above steps:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Read the image
img = cv2.imread('x8Nbb.png', 0)

# Threshold the image
_, thresh = cv2.threshold(img, 127, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)

# Find contours
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(thresh, cv2.RETR_TREE, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Filter contours based on area
filtered_contours = [cnt for cnt in contours if cv2.contourArea(cnt) > 100]

# Create a blank image to draw the contours
output = np.zeros_like(img)

# Draw the contours
cv2.drawContours(output, filtered_contours, -1, (255), 3)

# Show the image
cv2.imshow('Output', output)
cv2.waitKey(0)
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
```

Note: The above code is a basic example and might not work perfectly for your image. You might need to adjust the parameters and add more processing steps depending on your specific requirements. For example, you might need to use morphological operations to clean up the image, or use a more sophisticated method to filter the contours.
