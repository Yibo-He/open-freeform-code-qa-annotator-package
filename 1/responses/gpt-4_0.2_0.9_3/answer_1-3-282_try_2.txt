It seems like you want to install Python 3.7.0 in a clean environment and then use pip to install another application. Here are the steps to do this:

1. First, update your package list:
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the necessary packages:
```bash
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev libssl-dev openssl libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
```

3. Install Python3 and pip:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-pip python3-dev
```

4. If you want to install a specific version of Python, you can do it from the source. Here is how you can install Python 3.7.0:

```bash
wget https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/Python-3.7.0.tgz
tar xvf Python-3.7.0.tgz
cd Python-3.7.0
./configure --enable-optimizations
make
sudo make altinstall
```

5. Verify the installation:
```bash
python3.7 -V
```

6. Now, you can create a virtual environment to install your application in a clean environment. First, install the `python3.7-venv` package:
```bash
sudo apt-get install python3.7-venv
```

7. Create a new virtual environment:
```bash
python3.7 -m venv myenv
```

8. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
source myenv/bin/activate
```

9. Now, you are in a clean environment. You can use pip to install your application:
```bash
pip install your_application
```

10. When you are done, you can deactivate the virtual environment:
```bash
deactivate
```

Please replace `your_application` with the name of the application you want to install.
