The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each individual character is within `correct`. 

You can use the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if all characters in the input are in `correct`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if all(char in correct for char in text):
    print("Success")
```

This code will check each character in `text` to see if it's in `correct`. If all characters are in `correct`, it will print "Success".
