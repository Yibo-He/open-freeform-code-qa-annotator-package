The error is because you're trying to sort a list, not a vector. The `sort()` function in R works on vectors, not lists. 

You can sort the vector before converting it to a list. Here's how you can do it:

```r
# Creating a random vector of letters
random_text_data = sample(letters, 10)
random_text_data

# Sort the vector
sorted_text_data = sort(random_text_data)
sorted_text_data

# Convert to list
list_text_data = as.list(sorted_text_data)
list_text_data
```

This will give you a list of letters sorted in alphabetical order.
