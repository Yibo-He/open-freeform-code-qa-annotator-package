The warning message you're seeing is due to a change in the Selenium library. The `executable_path` argument is being deprecated, and Selenium is moving towards using the `Service` object instead.

You can fix this warning by creating a `Service` object with the path to the driver, and then passing that service object when creating the `webdriver.Chrome` instance. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
# pip install webdriver-manager
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

# Create a Service object with the path to the driver
s=Service(ChromeDriverManager().install())

# Pass the Service object when creating the webdriver.Chrome instance
driver = webdriver.Chrome(service=s)
driver.maximize_window()

driver.get('https://www.google.com')
driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'q').send_keys('Yasser Khalil')
```

This should eliminate the deprecation warning you're seeing.
