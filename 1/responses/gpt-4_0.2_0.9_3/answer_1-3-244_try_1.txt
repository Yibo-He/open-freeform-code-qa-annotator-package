Yes, it is possible to print text with RGB colored background in Python. The ANSI escape code for setting the background color in RGB is `\033[48;2;r;g;bm`. Here's how you can modify your function to set the background color:

```python
def colored_bg(r, g, b, text):
    return "\033[48;2;{};{};{}m{} \033[0m".format(r, g, b, text)

text = "Hello, World"
colored_text = colored_bg(132, 204, 247, text)
print(colored_text)
```

This will print the text "Hello, World" with a background color of RGB(132, 204, 247). The `\033[0m` at the end resets the background color to the terminal's default.

Please note that not all terminals support RGB color codes. If you're finding that the colors aren't displaying correctly, it may be that your terminal doesn't support this feature.
