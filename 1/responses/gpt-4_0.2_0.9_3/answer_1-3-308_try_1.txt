The error message you're seeing is due to pip trying to uninstall a version of llvmlite that was installed by conda. Pip doesn't have the ability to uninstall packages installed by conda, hence the error.

Here are a few potential solutions:

1. **Use conda to install librosa**: Since you're already using conda, you can try installing librosa with it instead of pip. You can do this by running `conda install -c conda-forge librosa`. The conda-forge channel often has more up-to-date versions of packages than the default conda channel.

2. **Create a new conda environment**: Sometimes, package conflicts can be resolved by creating a new environment. You can do this with `conda create -n new_env python=3.7`, then activate it with `conda activate new_env`, and finally install librosa with `pip install librosa`.

3. **Ignore installed packages**: You can tell pip to ignore the installed packages and install librosa anyway. This can be done with `pip install --ignore-installed librosa`. However, be aware that this may lead to other issues down the line if other packages depend on the specific version of llvmlite that's currently installed.

4. **Uninstall llvmlite with conda and then install librosa**: First, uninstall llvmlite with `conda uninstall llvmlite`. Then, try installing librosa with `pip install librosa`. This should work if librosa doesn't actually need the specific version of llvmlite that was installed.

Remember to always keep your Python environment clean and try to avoid mixing conda and pip as much as possible to prevent these kinds of issues.
