Yes, you can run Homebrew and install development tools like Python, Node, etc. on a MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. However, there are a few things you should be aware of:

1. Homebrew: Homebrew has been updated to work on Apple's M1 ARM processors. However, not all packages available through Homebrew are compatible with the M1 chip yet. You can install Homebrew in a subdirectory of your home directory (e.g., /opt/homebrew) to avoid conflicts with Rosetta 2, Apple's technology for translating apps built for Intel processors.

2. Python: Python 3.9.1 and later versions provide support for Apple's M1 processors. You can install it using Homebrew or directly from the Python website.

3. Node.js: Node.js also supports Apple's M1 processors. You can install it using Homebrew, or you can download it directly from the Node.js website.

In general, while many popular development tools have been updated to support the M1 chip, you might still encounter some that don't. In such cases, you can use Rosetta 2 to run apps that were designed for Intel processors.
