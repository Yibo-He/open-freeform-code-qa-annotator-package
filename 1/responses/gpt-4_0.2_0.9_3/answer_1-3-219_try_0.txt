This issue might be due to several reasons. Here are some steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your virtual environment "da38". You can check this by clicking on the Python version on the bottom left of the VS Code status bar.

2. **Update Packages**: Update your Python packages, especially `ipykernel`, `ipython`, `jupyter_client`, `jupyter_core`, `traitlets`, and `tornado`. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `conda update --all` or `pip install --upgrade <package_name>`.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter**: Try reinstalling Jupyter in your virtual environment. Activate your conda environment and run `pip uninstall jupyter` followed by `pip install jupyter`.

4. **Check Jupyter Path**: Ensure that the Jupyter server is being started from the correct path. You can check this by running `jupyter --paths` in your terminal. If the paths are incorrect, you can correct them by setting the `JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable.

5. **Check VS Code Settings**: Check your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json` in your workspace or `File > Preferences > Settings` for global settings). Make sure the Python path is correct and the Jupyter settings are properly configured.

6. **Check for Errors**: Check the Jupyter server logs for any errors. You can also try running a Jupyter notebook from the command line to see if it works outside of VS Code.

7. **VS Code Python Extension**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

If none of these steps work, it might be helpful to provide more information about your setup, such as the versions of the packages you're using and any error messages you're seeing in the logs.
