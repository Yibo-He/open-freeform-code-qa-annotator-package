Based on the information you provided, it seems like the issue might be related to the Python interpreter selected in VS Code. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your virtual environment "da38". You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code. If it's not the correct one, you can select it from the list.

2. **Check the Jupyter Server**: VS Code uses the Jupyter server to run the notebooks. Make sure that the Jupyter server is running correctly. You can try to run it manually from the command line using the command `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter in your Virtual Environment**: It's possible that the Jupyter installation in your virtual environment is corrupted. You can try to reinstall it using the following commands:

   ```
   conda activate da38
   conda install jupyter
   ```

4. **Check the Python Extension**: Make sure that the Python extension is installed and enabled in VS Code. If it's already installed, you can try to uninstall and reinstall it.

5. **Check the VS Code Settings**: Check the settings of VS Code to make sure that it's correctly configured to use Jupyter. You can find the settings in the `.vscode` folder in your workspace. The settings should look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "python.pythonPath": "/path/to/your/virtual/environment",
     "python.dataScience.jupyterServerURI": "http://localhost:8888/?token=your_token"
   }
   ```

6. **Check the Logs**: If none of the above steps work, you can check the logs of VS Code to see if there are any error messages that can help you identify the issue. You can find the logs in the Output panel (View -> Output, change the dropdown to Python).

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., the version of VS Code, the Python extension, and Jupyter) and any error messages you see in the logs.
