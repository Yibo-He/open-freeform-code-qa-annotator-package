The error you're seeing is likely because the SHA hash you're trying to checkout doesn't exist in your repository. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Verify the SHA hash: Make sure that the SHA hash you're trying to checkout actually exists in your repository. You can do this by running `git log` and looking for the SHA hash in the output.

2. Use absolute path for the repository: Instead of using `cd` to change the current working directory, you can specify the repository directly in the `subprocess.check_output` call. This can help avoid issues with relative paths.

3. Error handling: Add some error handling to your script to catch exceptions and print out useful debug information. This can help you figure out exactly what's going wrong.

Here's how you might modify your script to incorporate these suggestions:

```python
import os
import csv
import subprocess

with open(filename) as inputfile:
    reader = csv.reader(inputfile, delimiter=",")
    linecount = 0
    for row in reader:
        if linecount == 0:
            linecount += 1
        else:
            repo = str(row[0])
            sha = str(row[2])
            specificfile = str(row[3])
            linenum = int(row[4])
            try:
                subprocess.check_output(['git', '-C', repo, 'checkout', sha])
                print("checkout done")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                print(f"Failed to checkout {sha} in repository {repo}. Error: {e}")
```

In this script, I've used the `-C` option with the `git` command to specify the repository, and I've added a `try`/`except` block to catch `CalledProcessError` exceptions and print out some useful debug information.
