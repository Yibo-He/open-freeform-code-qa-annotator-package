The error you're encountering is often due to one of the following reasons:

1. There might be a problem with the installation of PyTorch. You can try to uninstall and then reinstall PyTorch. 

2. There might be a conflict with the system PATH. Make sure that the path to the Python interpreter you're using is correctly set in your system's PATH variable.

3. There might be a conflict with other Python packages or versions. Make sure you're using a clean Python environment, and that there are no conflicts with other installed packages or Python versions.

Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and solve your problem:

1. Create a new conda environment and install PyTorch in that environment. This can help isolate the problem and avoid conflicts with other packages or Python versions. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n new_env python=3.8
conda activate new_env
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
```

2. If the problem persists, try installing a different version of PyTorch, or try installing it with pip instead of conda. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
pip install torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

3. If none of the above solutions work, there might be a problem with your Python or Anaconda installation. In this case, you might want to consider reinstalling Python or Anaconda.

Remember to always activate your conda environment before running your Python code:

```bash
conda activate new_env
```

And then you can run Python and import torch:

```python
python
>>> import torch
```
