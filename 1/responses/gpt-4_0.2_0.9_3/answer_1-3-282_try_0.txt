It seems like you're trying to install Python 3.7 and pip on a clean environment. Here are the steps to do it:

1. First, update the package list by running:
```
sudo apt-get update
```
2. Install the necessary packages for Python to run:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev libssl-dev openssl libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
```
3. Install Python 3.7:
```
sudo apt-get install python3.7
```
4. Install pip for Python 3:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```
5. Verify the installation by checking the Python and pip versions:
```
python3.7 -V
pip3 -V
```
If you want to create a clean environment to test the installation of another application, you can use virtual environments. Python3 comes with the `venv` module to create virtual environments.

Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

1. First, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
2. Run the following command to create a new virtual environment:
```
python3.7 -m venv myenv
```
3. Activate the virtual environment:
```
source myenv/bin/activate
```
Now, you're in a clean environment where you can test the installation of your application. When you're done, you can deactivate the virtual environment by simply typing `deactivate` in your terminal.
