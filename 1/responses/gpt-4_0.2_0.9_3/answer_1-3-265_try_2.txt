Yes, you can encrypt your JSON file using a key. Here's a simple way to do it using the cryptography library in Python. 

First, you need to install the cryptography library. You can do this using pip:

```bash
pip install cryptography
```

Here is a simple example of how you can encrypt and decrypt a JSON file:

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import json

# Generate a key and instantiate a Fernet instance
key = Fernet.generate_key()
cipher_suite = Fernet(key)

# Your data
data = {
    "name": "John",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}

# Convert the data to JSON and then to bytes
data = json.dumps(data)
data = data.encode()

# Encrypt the data
cipher_text = cipher_suite.encrypt(data)

# You can write the encrypted data to a file
with open('encrypted_file', 'wb') as file:
    file.write(cipher_text)

# To decrypt it, read the file and then use the Fernet instance to decrypt
with open('encrypted_file', 'rb') as file:
    encrypted_data = file.read()

plain_text = cipher_suite.decrypt(encrypted_data)

# Convert bytes to JSON
plain_text = plain_text.decode()
data = json.loads(plain_text)

print(data)
```

In this example, the key is generated each time the program is run. In a real-world scenario, you would want to keep the key secret and constant, so you would generate it once and then use it to encrypt and decrypt your data.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not be suitable for a production environment. For a more secure solution, you might want to consider using a key management service or a more advanced encryption method.
