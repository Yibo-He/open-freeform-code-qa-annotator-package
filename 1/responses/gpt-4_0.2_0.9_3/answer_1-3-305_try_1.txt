The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Update Conda:** Your Conda version might be outdated, which could be causing the problem. Update it by running `conda update -n base -c defaults conda`.

2. **Create a new environment:** Sometimes, the existing environment has conflicting packages that prevent the installation of a new package. Create a new environment and try installing Node.js in that environment. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n myenv
conda activate myenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

3. **Specify the version and build:** You can also try specifying the version and build in the install command like this:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba:** If none of the above solutions work, you can try using mamba, a faster, more robust package manager that's fully compatible with Conda. You can install it using `conda install mamba -c conda-forge`, and then use it to install Node.js like this:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

Remember to replace `conda` with `mamba` in your commands when you're using mamba.
