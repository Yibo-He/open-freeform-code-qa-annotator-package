You can achieve this by using the itertools.cycle function which returns an iterator that produces elements from the iterable until it is exhausted, then repeats the sequence indefinitely.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
import itertools

my_list = ['abc','def','hig']
df['names'] = list(itertools.islice(itertools.cycle(my_list), len(df)))
```

This code will fill the 'names' column with the values in 'my_list' in the same order, repeating the list until all rows in the dataframe are filled.
