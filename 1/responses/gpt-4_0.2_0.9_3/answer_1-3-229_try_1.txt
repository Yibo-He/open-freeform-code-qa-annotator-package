As of now, the Jupyter extension in Visual Studio Code does not support find and replace within a single cell. The find and replace functionality (Ctrl+H) applies to the entire notebook.

However, you can use the following workaround:

1. Copy the content of the cell to a new Python file.
2. Use the find and replace functionality (Ctrl+H) in the Python file.
3. Copy the content back to the Jupyter cell.

Remember to provide feedback to the Visual Studio Code team about this feature. They are constantly improving the product and they might consider adding this functionality in the future.
