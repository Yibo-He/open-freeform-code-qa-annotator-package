The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that there is a problem with the psycopg2 binary package you installed. It seems like the binary package is not compatible with your system.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Try using psycopg2-binary**: The psycopg2-binary package is a stand-alone package that includes its own Python and PostgreSQL library dependencies. It is easier to install but not suitable for production. To install it, you can use pip:

    ```
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

2. **Check your Python version**: Make sure you are using a Python version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure you are using a PostgreSQL version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install.

4. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Uninstall the current psycopg2 package and then reinstall it. Sometimes, this can fix the problem.

    ```
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    pip install psycopg2
    ```

5. **Install psycopg2 from source**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try installing psycopg2 from source. This requires a C compiler and the PostgreSQL headers.

    ```
    pip install psycopg2 --no-binary :all:
    ```

Remember to replace `pip` with `conda` if you are using Anaconda. Also, make sure to activate your conda environment before installing the package.
