The issue might be due to the fact that the newline characters in your PDF are not exactly "\r\n". They might be just "\n" or "\r". 

You can try replacing each of them separately:

```python
from tika import parser

filename = 'myfile.pdf'
raw = parser.from_file(filename)
content = raw['content']
content = content.replace("\r", "").replace("\n", "")
print(content)
```

This code will replace both "\r" and "\n" characters in your string.

If you want to replace multiple types of whitespace characters (like newlines, spaces, tabs etc.) you can use the `re` module:

```python
import re
from tika import parser

filename = 'myfile.pdf'
raw = parser.from_file(filename)
content = raw['content']
content = re.sub('\s', '', content)
print(content)
```

The '\s' pattern matches any whitespace character.
