The correct syntax for importing resources with `for_each` in Terraform is as follows:

```bash
terraform import 'aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"]' logs_bucket
```

The resource address must be in quotes and the map key must be in double quotes. 

So, for your case, you should be able to import the existing S3 buckets with the following commands:

```bash
terraform import 'aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"]' logs_bucket
terraform import 'aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"]' cloudtrail_bucket
```

Remember to replace `logs_bucket` and `cloudtrail_bucket` with the actual AWS S3 bucket names.
