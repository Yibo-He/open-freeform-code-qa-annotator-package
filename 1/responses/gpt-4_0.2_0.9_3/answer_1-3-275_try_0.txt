From your code, it seems like you're trying to create a DAG with 6 tasks and you're using the DatabricksSubmitRunOperator to submit Spark jobs to Databricks. However, you didn't provide the error message you're encountering, which makes it difficult to provide a specific solution.

Here are some general tips to debug your DAG:

1. **Check your Airflow and Databricks Connection**: Make sure that the `databricks_conn_id` you're using is correctly set up in Airflow and it has the right permissions to submit jobs to Databricks.

2. **Check your Cluster ID**: You're using `{{ dag_run.conf.clusterId }}` as your `existing_cluster_id`. Make sure that you're passing the correct cluster ID when triggering the DAG run.

3. **Check your JAR files and Main Class Names**: Make sure that the JAR files you're referencing in `dbfs:/task_x/task_x.jar` exist in your Databricks File System (DBFS) and the main class names `com.task_x.driver.TestClassx` exist in your JAR files.

4. **Check your Task Dependencies**: You're setting up task dependencies at the end of your script with `task_1 >> [task_2 , task_3] >> [ task_4 , task_5 ] >> task_6`. Make sure that this is the correct order of execution for your tasks.

5. **Check your Airflow Logs**: Airflow logs can provide more details about the error. You can find them in the Airflow webserver under the "Log" tab of each task instance.

6. **Check your Databricks Logs**: If your tasks are failing on Databricks, you can check the logs in the Databricks workspace for more details about the error.

If you can provide the error message you're getting, I can give you a more specific solution.
