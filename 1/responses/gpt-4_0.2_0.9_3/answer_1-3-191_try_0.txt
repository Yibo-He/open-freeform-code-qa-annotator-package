You can use a list comprehension to return the elements that partially match the string. Here's how you can do it:

```python
l = ['ones', 'twos', 'threes']
wanted = 'three'

matching = [s for s in l if s.startswith(wanted)]
```

In this case, `matching` will be `['threes']`. If there are multiple elements that match the condition, they will all be included in the list. If no elements match, `matching` will be an empty list.

This approach can be easily modified to match other conditions. For example, to match elements that end with the string, you can use `s.endswith(wanted)`. To match elements that contain the string anywhere, you can use `wanted in s`.
