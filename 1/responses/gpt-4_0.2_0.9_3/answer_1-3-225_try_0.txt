The problem with your code is that you are returning the word immediately after processing the first word in the text. This causes the function to exit and not process the remaining words. Also, you are not storing the processed words anywhere to return them all together.

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this version, we create a list `pig_latin_words` to store the processed words. After processing each word, we append it to this list. At the end of the function, we join all the words in the list with a space and return the result.
