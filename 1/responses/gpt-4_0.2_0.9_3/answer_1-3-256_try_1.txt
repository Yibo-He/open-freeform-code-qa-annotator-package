Yes, `pip` will continue to work with Python 2.7 after its end of life. You will still be able to install packages for Python 2.7 using `pip install abc==1.2.3`. 

However, it's important to note that while `pip` will continue to work, many package maintainers will stop supporting Python 2.7. This means that over time, you may find that newer versions of packages are not compatible with Python 2.7. 

Also, the Python Package Index (PyPI) will continue to serve Python 2 packages, but there's no guarantee for how long. 

In general, while it's technically possible to continue using Python 2.7 after its end of life, it's strongly recommended to upgrade to Python 3 to benefit from its improvements and to receive ongoing support and updates.
