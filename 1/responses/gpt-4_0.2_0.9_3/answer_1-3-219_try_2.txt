Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the Jupyter server is having trouble starting up. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter:** Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your "da38" conda environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code, and then selecting the correct interpreter from the list.

2. **Check your Jupyter installation:** Make sure that Jupyter is properly installed in your "da38" conda environment. You can do this by activating your conda environment in the terminal and then running `jupyter notebook`. If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it with `conda install jupyter`.

3. **Check your ipykernel version:** The ipykernel package is what allows Jupyter to interact with your Python code. It's possible that there's a version mismatch between Jupyter and ipykernel. You can check the version of ipykernel in your "da38" environment by running `pip show ipykernel`. If it's not the latest version, you can update it with `pip install --upgrade ipykernel`.

4. **Check your VS Code settings:** It's possible that there's a setting in VS Code that's causing the issue. You can try resetting your VS Code settings to their default values to see if that resolves the issue. You can do this by going to File > Preferences > Settings and then searching for the setting you want to reset.

5. **Check your VS Code extensions:** There might be an issue with the Python extension for VS Code. You can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the Python extension to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, it might be helpful to look at the Jupyter server logs to see if there are any error messages that could help diagnose the problem. You can view the logs by running `jupyter notebook --debug` in your "da38" environment.
