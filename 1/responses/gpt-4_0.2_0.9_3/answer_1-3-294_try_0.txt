The error message you're seeing is typically due to a version mismatch between the `six` module and the `googleapiclient` module. The `six.moves.collections_abc` attribute was added in a later version of `six`, so if you're using an older version of `six`, you might not have this attribute, hence the `AttributeError`.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Upgrade the `six` module**: You can upgrade the `six` module to the latest version using pip:

   ```
   pip install --upgrade six
   ```

   After upgrading, try running your script again to see if the issue is resolved.

2. **Check the version of `six`**: You can check the version of `six` you're using with the following command:

   ```
   python -c "import six; print(six.__version__)"
   ```

   If the version is less than 1.13.0, you should upgrade it, as the `collections_abc` attribute was added in version 1.13.0.

3. **Check the version of `googleapiclient`**: Similarly, you can check the version of `googleapiclient` you're using with the following command:

   ```
   python -c "import googleapiclient; print(googleapiclient.__version__)"
   ```

   If the version is very old, you might consider upgrading it as well.

4. **Check for multiple versions of `six`**: It's possible that you have multiple versions of `six` installed in different locations, and the older version is being used. You can check for this with the following command:

   ```
   python -c "import six; print(six.__file__)"
   ```

   This will print the location of the `six` module that's being used. If this is not the location where you installed the latest version of `six`, you might need to adjust your PYTHONPATH or uninstall the old version.

5. **Reinstall `googleapiclient`**: If all else fails, you might consider uninstalling and reinstalling the `googleapiclient` module. This should ensure that it's using the correct version of `six`.

   ```
   pip uninstall google-api-python-client
   pip install google-api-python-client
   ```
