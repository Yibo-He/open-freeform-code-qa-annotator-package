It seems like you're trying to install Python 3.7 and pip on a Linux system. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Update the packages list:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get install build-essential libpq-dev libssl-dev openssl libffi-dev zlib1g-dev
```

3. Install Python 3.7:

```
sudo apt-get install python3.7
```

4. Install pip for Python 3:

```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

5. Verify the installation:

```
python3.7 -V
pip3 -V
```

The above commands should return the version of Python and pip installed.

If you want to create a clean environment to test the installation of another application, you can use virtual environments. Python3's venv is a good tool for this. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

1. First, navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.

2. Create a new virtual environment:

```
python3.7 -m venv myenv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

```
source myenv/bin/activate
```

Now, you're in a clean environment where you can install and test your application. To deactivate the virtual environment, just type `deactivate`.
