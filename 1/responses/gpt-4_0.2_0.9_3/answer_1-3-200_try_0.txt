The error message you're seeing usually means that the command you're trying to run in the subprocess is failing. In this case, it seems like the `git checkout` command is failing.

One possible reason for this could be that the SHA hash you're trying to checkout doesn't exist in your repository. You can verify this by manually running `git checkout 62bbce43e` in your repository and seeing if it works.

Another possible issue could be that your Python script is not in the correct directory when it tries to run the `git checkout` command. The `subprocess` module runs commands in the current working directory of your Python script, which might not be the same as the directory of your Git repository.

You're using `cl("cd", repo)` to change directories, but it's not clear what this function does. If it's supposed to change the current working directory of your Python script, it might not be working as expected.

Instead, you can use `os.chdir(repo)` to change the current working directory of your Python script. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import os
import csv
import subprocess

with open(filename) as inputfile:
    reader = csv.reader(inputfile, delimiter=",")
    linecount = 0
    for row in reader:
        if linecount == 0:
            linecount += 1
        else:
            repo = str(row[0])
            sha = str(row[2])
            specificfile = str(row[3])
            linenum = int(row[4])
            os.chdir(repo)
            subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', sha])
            print("checkout done")
            subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', '-'])
```

This code will change the current working directory to `repo` before running the `git checkout` command. If `repo` is the path to your Git repository, this should allow the `git checkout` command to run successfully.

Remember to handle exceptions for the case when the `repo` directory doesn't exist or the `sha` is not found in the repository.
