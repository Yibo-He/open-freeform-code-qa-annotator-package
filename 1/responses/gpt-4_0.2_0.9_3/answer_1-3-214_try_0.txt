It seems like you have already figured out the solution to your problem. The issue was due to an outdated version of pandas-profiling. 

For the benefit of others who might encounter the same problem, here's how to update pandas-profiling in conda:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type the following command to update pandas-profiling:

If the package is not found, you might need to install it first using:
