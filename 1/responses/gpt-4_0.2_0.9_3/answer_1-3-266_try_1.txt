It seems like your static files are not being served correctly. In a production environment, Django doesn't serve static files itself, it leaves that job to the web server or a separate file server because it's more efficient.

Azure Web Apps are a bit different from traditional web servers. They do not serve static files in the same way. You need to configure your web app to serve static files.

Here's how you can do it:

1. You need to add a `web.config` file in your `wwwroot` directory. This file is used by Azure to configure the IIS server that runs your application.

2. In the `web.config` file, you need to add a rule to serve static files. Here's an example of how the `web.config` file should look:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="Static Files" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="^(static|media)/.*" />
          <action type="Rewrite" url="{R:0}" />
        </rule>
        <rule name="Configure Python" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="(.*)" ignoreCase="false" />
          <conditions>
            <add input="{REQUEST_URI}" pattern="^/(static|media)/.*" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
          </conditions>
          <action type="Rewrite" url="handler.fcgi/{R:1}" appendQueryString="true" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
    </rewrite>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This configuration file tells IIS to serve files from the `static` and `media` directories directly, and to pass all other requests to Django.

3. After adding the `web.config` file, you need to restart your web app for the changes to take effect.

Remember to replace `handler.fcgi` with the actual path to your Django application if it's different.

Also, please note that serving static files from a web application is not the best practice for performance and scalability reasons. In a production environment, you should consider serving static files from a dedicated static file server or a CDN.
