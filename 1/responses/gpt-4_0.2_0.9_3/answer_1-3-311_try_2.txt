You can use the `applymap()` function in pandas to apply a function to every single element of the dataframe. Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will replace all values in your dataframe that are greater than or equal to 25 with 1, and all other values with 0.
