The error message you're seeing is because the `wrapt` package was installed using a method other than `pip`, and `pip` is unable to uninstall it. 

You can try to force reinstall `wrapt` using `pip` with the `--ignore-installed` flag. This will ignore the check for installed version of `wrapt` and overwrite it.

Here is the command:

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed wrapt
```

After this, you should be able to install `tensorflow-gpu`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

If this doesn't work, you may need to manually remove the `wrapt` package. 

You can find the location of the package with the following command:

```bash
python -c "import wrapt; print(wrapt.__path__)"
```

Then, you can manually delete the package and reinstall it using `pip`. 

Please note that manually deleting Python packages can potentially break your environment, so proceed with caution. If possible, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid such issues.
