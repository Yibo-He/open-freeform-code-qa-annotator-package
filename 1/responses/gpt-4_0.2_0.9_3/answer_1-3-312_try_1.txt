The error you're encountering seems to be related to the PyTorch installation. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Uninstall and Reinstall PyTorch**: Sometimes, the installation might not have completed successfully, causing some files to be missing or corrupted. You can uninstall PyTorch using the command `conda uninstall pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch` and then reinstall it.

2. **Install a Specific Version of PyTorch**: Sometimes, the latest version of a package might have compatibility issues with your system or other packages. You can try installing a specific version of PyTorch that you know works well. For example, you can use the command `conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cpuonly -c pytorch` to install version 1.6.0 of PyTorch and version 0.7.0 of torchvision.

3. **Update Anaconda and Conda**: It's possible that your Anaconda or Conda installation is outdated, causing compatibility issues. You can update Anaconda using the command `conda update anaconda` and Conda using the command `conda update conda`.

4. **Check for System Issues**: The error message mentions a DLL file, which is a type of file used by Windows. It's possible that there's an issue with your Windows installation. You can try updating Windows, reinstalling Anaconda, or even reinstalling Windows if necessary.

5. **Ask for Help**: If none of the above steps work, you can ask for help on the PyTorch forums or on Stack Overflow. Make sure to provide all the details about your problem, including the error message, what you've tried so far, and any other relevant information.

Remember to restart your system after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
