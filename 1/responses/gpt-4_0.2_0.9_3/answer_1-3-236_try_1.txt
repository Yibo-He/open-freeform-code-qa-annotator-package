The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that Jedi is not just a linter but also a library for autocompletion and code navigation. Therefore, even if you disable it as a linter, it might still be active for other tasks.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check if you have any other extensions installed that might be using Jedi. If you find any, disable them and see if the problem persists.

2. Try to disable Jedi completely by adding the following line to your settings.json file:
   `"python.jediEnabled": false`
   
3. If the above steps don't work, you can try to uninstall and reinstall the Python extension. Sometimes, this can help to reset the settings and solve any conflicts.

4. If none of the above steps work, it might be a bug in the Python extension. In this case, you should report the issue to the developers of the extension. They might be able to provide a fix or a workaround.

Remember to restart your IDE after making these changes to ensure they take effect.
