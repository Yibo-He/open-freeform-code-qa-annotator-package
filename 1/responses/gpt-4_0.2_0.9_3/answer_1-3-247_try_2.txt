The error message is indicating that Django is trying to reverse the URL for 'profile' with an empty string as the argument, but it can't find a match in your URL patterns.

This is happening because you are trying to access `post.author.username` in your template, but `post.author` is `None` for at least one of your `NewPost` instances. This is because you have set `null=True` on the `author` field in your `NewPost` model, which means it's possible to create a `NewPost` without an author.

To fix this, you should ensure that every `NewPost` has an author before it is saved. If a `NewPost` can be created without a user being logged in, you should handle this case in your template. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```html
{% for post in posts %}
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body"> Title: {{post.title}} </div>
        <div class="card-body"> Description: {{post.description}}</div>
        {% if post.author %}
            <p> {{post.author.username}} </p>
            <div class="card-body">
                <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
                    @{{post.author.username}}
                </a>
            </div>
        {% else %}
            <p> No author </p>
        {% endif %}
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

In this example, the template checks if `post.author` is `None` before trying to access `post.author.username`. If `post.author` is `None`, it simply displays "No author".
