The error message indicates that there is a problem with the CMake installation. CMake is a tool that helps in managing the build process of software using compiler-independent methods. It is required for building OpenCV from source.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check if CMake is installed**: You can do this by running the command `cmake --version` in your terminal. If CMake is installed, this command will return the version of CMake that is currently installed on your system.

2. **Install/Update CMake**: If CMake is not installed or if it's outdated, you can install/update it using the following commands:

   - For Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install cmake`
   - For CentOS: `sudo yum install cmake`

3. **Install OpenCV from source**: If the issue persists even after ensuring that CMake is installed and up-to-date, you might want to consider installing OpenCV from source instead of using pip. Here is a general guide on how to do this:

   - First, clone the OpenCV repository: `git clone https://github.com/opencv/opencv.git`
   - Then, navigate to the cloned directory: `cd opencv`
   - Create a new directory for the build: `mkdir build && cd build`
   - Run CMake to configure the build. This might look something like this: `cmake -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ..`
   - Finally, compile and install OpenCV: `make -j4 && sudo make install`

Please note that the above commands are general guidelines and might need to be adapted to your specific situation. Also, building OpenCV from source can take a significant amount of time, especially on devices with limited computational resources like the Jetson Nano.
