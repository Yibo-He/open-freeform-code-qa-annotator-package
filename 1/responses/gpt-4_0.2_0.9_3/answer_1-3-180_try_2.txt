In pandas, you can filter your DataFrame before applying groupby. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST'].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count()
```

This line of code will first filter your DataFrame to only include rows where 'TEST_STATUS' is 'PASS TEST'. Then it will group by 'TEST_STATUS' and count the number of occurrences.

If you want to see all the data for 'PASS TEST', you don't need to use groupby. You can just filter the DataFrame:

```python
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will return all rows in your DataFrame where 'TEST_STATUS' is 'PASS TEST'.
