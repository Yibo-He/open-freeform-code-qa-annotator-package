You're on the right track, but you need to use the variable `i` to slice the string. In your current code, you're always slicing the string from index 0 to 2, which is why you're not getting the desired output. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
str1 = 'teststring'
i = 0
while i < len(str1) - 1:  # subtract 1 to avoid index out of range error
    str2 = str1[i:i+2]
    print(str2)
    i += 1
```

This code will start at the first character of the string, slice out two characters, print them, and then move to the next character. It will continue this until it has printed all pairs of characters in the string.
