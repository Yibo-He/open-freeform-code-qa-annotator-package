You can achieve this using the `strsplit` function in R. Here's a simple example:

```R
# Your data
data <- "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC"

# Split the data by comma
split_data <- strsplit(data, ",")

# Split each element by colon and convert it to a data frame
df <- as.data.frame(do.call(rbind, lapply(split_data, function(x) strsplit(x, ":")[[1]][2])))

# Set the column names
colnames(df) <- sapply(strsplit(data, "[,:]")[[1]], function(x) x[seq(1, length(x), 2)])

df
```

This will give you a data frame like this:

```
  name Age City
1 Michael 31  NYC
```

This code works by first splitting the data by comma, then splitting each element by colon. The result is a list of character vectors, which is then converted to a data frame. The column names are extracted from the original data by splitting it by both comma and colon and taking every second element.

Please note that this code assumes that your data is well-formed and doesn't contain any missing values. If your data might be incomplete or malformed, you should add some error checking.
