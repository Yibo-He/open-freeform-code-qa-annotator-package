The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` suggests that there's a problem with the psycopg2 library that you've installed. It seems like the library is not compatible with your system or there's a missing dependency.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: The psycopg2-binary package is a stand-alone package that includes its own Python and PostgreSQL library dependencies. It's easier to install and doesn't require a compiler or external libraries. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip uninstall psycopg2
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

2. **Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**: psycopg2 requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package. If it's not installed on your system, you might get a DLL load failed error. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

3. **Check your Python and psycopg2 versions**: Make sure that your Python version is compatible with the psycopg2 version you're trying to install. If you're using a 64-bit version of Python, you should install the 64-bit version of psycopg2, and vice versa.

4. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the Python and PostgreSQL directories are in your system's PATH. If they're not, Python might not be able to find the necessary DLLs.

5. **Try using a different Python environment**: If you're using Anaconda, try creating a new environment and installing psycopg2 there. If you're not using Anaconda, try installing it and using an Anaconda environment.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your system (Python version, psycopg2 version, etc.) so I can give you more specific advice.
