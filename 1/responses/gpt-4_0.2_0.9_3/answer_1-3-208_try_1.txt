The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string `text` is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character in `text` is in `correct`. 

Here's how you can modify your code to check each character:

```python
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

if all(c in correct for c in text):
    print("Success")
```

In this code, `all(c in correct for c in text)` will return `True` if all characters in `text` are in `correct`, and `False` otherwise.
