You can create a forest plot in Python using the `matplotlib` library. However, Python does not have a built-in function for creating forest plots like `metamiss` in STATA or `metafor` in R. You will need to manually create the plot using the `matplotlib` library.

Here is a simple example of how you can create a forest plot in Python:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Define your data
studies = ['Study 1', 'Study 2', 'Study 3', 'Study 4', 'Study 5']
mean = [1.2, 2.3, 3.4, 4.5, 5.6]
std_err = [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5]

# Create a figure and a plot
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# Create a horizontal bar plot
y_pos = np.arange(len(studies))
ax.errorbar(mean, y_pos, xerr=std_err, fmt='o')

# Label the y-axis with the studies
ax.set_yticks(y_pos)
ax.set_yticklabels(studies)

# Invert the y-axis so that the first study is at the top
ax.invert_yaxis()

# Label the x-axis
ax.set_xlabel('Mean effect')

# Give the plot a title
ax.set_title('Forest plot')

# Show the plot
plt.show()
```

This code will create a simple forest plot with the mean effect size and standard error for each study. You can adjust the data and labels to fit your needs.

If you want to create more complex forest plots, you might need to use more advanced features of the `matplotlib` library, or use a specialized library for creating forest plots. Unfortunately, as of now, there are no Python libraries that specifically cater to creating forest plots.
