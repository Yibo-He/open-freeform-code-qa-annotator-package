It seems like you have a problem with your pip3 installation. The error message `'module' object is not callable` usually indicates that you're trying to call a module as if it were a function.

Here are the steps to reinstall pip3:

1. First, uninstall pip3:
```
sudo apt-get remove python3-pip
```

2. Then, reinstall pip3:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-pip
```

After reinstalling pip3, you should be able to install Jupyter Notebook with the following command:

```
pip3 install jupyter
```

If you still encounter the same error, it might be due to multiple versions of Python installed on your system. You can try to use `python3 -m pip install jupyter` instead.

If you're still having trouble, please let me know!
