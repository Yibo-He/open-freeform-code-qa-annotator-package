The error you're seeing is because you're trying to compare two arrays using `==`. This comparison will return an array of boolean values, not a single boolean value. Therefore, Python doesn't know how to interpret this in an `if` statement, which expects a single boolean value.

If you want to check if all values in the arrays are equal, you can use `numpy.array_equal()`:

```python
import numpy as np

if np.array_equal(mask_black, cv2.bitwise_and(mask_black, mask_not)):
    # body
else:
    # body
```

However, it seems like you're trying to check if `mask_black` is the bitwise inverse of itself, which will never be true. The bitwise inverse of an array will always be different from the original array.

If you want to perform different operations based on whether the image is mostly black or mostly white, you could calculate the mean of the `mask_black` array and use that in your condition:

```python
mean = np.mean(mask_black)

if mean > 127:  # adjust this threshold as needed
    # image is mostly white, detect black line
else:
    # image is mostly black, detect white line
```

This will give you a single boolean value that you can use in an `if` statement.
