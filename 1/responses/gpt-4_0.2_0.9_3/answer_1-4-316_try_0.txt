The error you're getting is because the `sort()` function in R doesn't work directly on lists. It works on vectors. 

However, your list is a list of vectors, each vector containing one character. You can unlist your list to a vector, sort it, and then convert it back to a list if you need. Here's how you can do it:

```R
# Unlist to a vector
vector_text_data = unlist(list_text_data)

# Sort the vector
sorted_vector = sort(vector_text_data)

# Convert back to list if needed
sorted_list = as.list(sorted_vector)

# Print sorted list
print(sorted_list)
```

This will give you a sorted list of characters.
