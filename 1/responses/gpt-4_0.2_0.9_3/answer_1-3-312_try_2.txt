The error you're encountering is related to a missing or incompatible DLL file. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Reinstall PyTorch**: Uninstall PyTorch and then reinstall it. Sometimes, the installation might not have completed successfully, causing some files to be missing or incompatible.

   To uninstall PyTorch, you can use the following command:
   ```
   conda uninstall pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```
   Then, reinstall it using the command you've provided.

2. **Update Anaconda and Conda**: Make sure that your Anaconda distribution and Conda package manager are up-to-date. You can update them using the following commands:
   ```
   conda update anaconda
   conda update conda
   ```
   After updating, try reinstalling PyTorch.

3. **Check your System Type**: Make sure you're installing the correct version of PyTorch for your system. If you're using a 64-bit version of Python, you should also be using a 64-bit version of PyTorch.

4. **Install with pip instead of conda**: Sometimes, installing PyTorch with pip instead of conda can solve the problem. You can try this with the following commands:
   ```
   pip uninstall torch torchvision
   pip install torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```
   This will install PyTorch, torchvision, and torchaudio for a CPU-only version of PyTorch.

5. **Create a new Conda environment**: Sometimes, there might be conflicts with other packages in your current Conda environment. Creating a new environment can help avoid these conflicts. Here's how you can do it:
   ```
   conda create -n new_env python=3.8
   conda activate new_env
   conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```
   This will create a new Conda environment with Python 3.8 and install PyTorch in this environment.

Remember to replace `new_env` with the name you want for your new environment.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a problem with your Python installation or your system. In this case, you might need to reinstall Python or check your system for issues.
