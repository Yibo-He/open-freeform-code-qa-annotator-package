The issue you're facing is due to the way you're storing the color codes in your `guesscolor` dictionary. You're using the letter itself as the key, which means that if a letter appears more than once, it will overwrite the previous color. 

To fix this, you should use the index of the letter as the key in your `guesscolor` dictionary, not the letter itself. This way, each letter (even if it's the same) will have its own unique key, and you won't overwrite the color of a previous letter.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
while (counter < lengthofword):
    if guessdict[counter] in choicedict.values():

        totalsame += 1

        if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
            print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
            sameword += 1
            guesscolor[counter] = "green"  # use counter as key

        else:
            guesscolor[counter] = "orange"  # use counter as key
        counter += 1

    else:
        guesscolor[counter] = "red"  # use counter as key
        counter += 1
```

This way, each letter in your guess will have its own color, even if the letter is the same as another letter in the guess.
