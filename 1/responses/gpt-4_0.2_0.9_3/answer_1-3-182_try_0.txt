You can achieve this by creating a main app that will handle the navigation and the display of the logo and title. Here's an example of how you can do it:

First, create a new Python file, let's call it `main.py`. This file will be responsible for displaying the logo, title, and handling the navigation between different pages of your app.

`main.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

PAGES = {
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2
}

def main():
    st.sidebar.title('My Logo')
    selection = st.sidebar.radio("Go to", list(PAGES.keys()))
    page = PAGES[selection]
    page.app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, modify your `Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py` files to have an `app` function that will be called when the page is selected:

`Page_1.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 2")
```

Now, you can run your app using:
```
$ streamlit run main.py
```

This will display your logo and title at the top of the sidebar, and below it, you will have a radio button selection for navigation between your pages. When you select a page, the corresponding `app` function will be called, displaying the content of the selected page.
