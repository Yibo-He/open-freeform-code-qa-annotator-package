If you are dealing with `pandas.Series` objects, you can use the `pandas.read_pickle` function to read the pickle files. However, if the reading process is slow due to the size of the files or the number of files, you might want to consider a few options:

1. **Dask**: Dask is a flexible library for parallel computing in Python that integrates with Pandas. It can handle large datasets that don't fit into memory and can use multiple cores. It's built on top of existing Python APIs and data structures, so you can move between Dask and Pandas/NumPy as appropriate.

2. **Ray**: Ray is a fast and simple framework for building and running distributed applications. Ray uses a global scheduler to achieve high performance and can be used with Pandas.

3. **Vaex**: Vaex is a python library for lazy, out-of-core DataFrames (similar to Pandas), to visualize and explore big tabular datasets. It can be faster than Pandas, because it uses memory mapping, a method used to store data in memory that allows you to work with larger datasets.

4. **Modin**: Modin is another library that speeds up your Pandas workflows by changing a single line of code. It uses Ray or Dask to provide an effortless way to speed up your pandas notebooks, scripts, and libraries.

Remember, the best library for you depends on your specific use case and requirements. You might need to try a few of them to see which one works best for your needs.
