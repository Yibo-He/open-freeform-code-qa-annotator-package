The error message is indicating that Django is unable to reverse a URL because it can't find a matching view function or pattern name. This is likely happening because in your template, you are using the `{% url %}` template tag with an empty string or a variable that is evaluating to an empty string.

The error is occurring at line 10 of your `base.html` file, but the code snippet you've provided doesn't seem to have a `{% url %}` tag at that line. It's possible that the error is in a different part of your template that extends or includes `base.html`.

Here are a few things you can check:

1. Look for any `{% url %}` tags in your templates. Make sure that the view name you're providing to the tag matches a name in your `urls.py` file.

2. If you're using a variable with the `{% url %}` tag, like `{% url my_view_name %}`, make sure that `my_view_name` is being correctly passed into the context of your template and that it's not an empty string.

3. Check your `urls.py` file to make sure all your URL patterns have a `name` attribute. The `name` attribute is what you should be using with the `{% url %}` tag.

4. If you're using namespaces with your URLs, you'll need to include the namespace in the `{% url %}` tag, like `{% url 'myapp:my_view_name' %}`.

Without seeing the actual template code, it's hard to give a more specific solution. But the error message is definitely indicating that the problem is with a `{% url %}` tag in one of your templates.
