The error message indicates that the zlib library, which is a required dependency for Pillow, is not found on your system. 

However, the main issue here is that you're trying to install Pillow version 6.0.0 which does not support Python 3.8. 

You should try installing a newer version of Pillow that supports Python 3.8. You can do this by simply running:

```bash
pip install pillow
```

This command will install the latest version of Pillow. If you want to install a specific version, you can do so by specifying the version number like this:

```bash
pip install pillow==8.2.0
```

This will install Pillow version 8.2.0, which supports Python 3.8.

If you still encounter issues, make sure that you have the latest version of pip. You can upgrade pip using the following command:

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

After upgrading pip, try installing Pillow again.
