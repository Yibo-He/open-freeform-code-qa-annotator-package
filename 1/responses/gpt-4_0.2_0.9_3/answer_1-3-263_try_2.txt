The `f` before the string in the `print` function is used to create what's called an f-string (formatted string literal) in Python. It's a way to embed expressions inside string literals, using curly braces `{}`. The expressions will be replaced with their values when the string is printed.

In your example:

```python
print(f"Input directory: {args.input_directory}")
print(f"Output directory: {args.output_directory}")
```

`{args.input_directory}` and `{args.output_directory}` are expressions. When the string is printed, these expressions are replaced with the values of `args.input_directory` and `args.output_directory` respectively.

So if `args.input_directory` is `/home/user/input` and `args.output_directory` is `/home/user/output`, the printed strings will be:

```
Input directory: /home/user/input
Output directory: /home/user/output
```

F-strings are a feature in Python 3.6 and later. They are a concise and convenient way to embed expressions inside string literals for formatting.
