The error you're encountering is likely due to the fact that TensorBoard is trying to access a local file system (your computer's file system) from Google Colab, which is a cloud-based environment. 

Here are the steps to solve this issue:

1. Upload your tfevent files to Google Drive.

2. Mount your Google Drive in your Google Colab notebook. You can do this with the following code:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/gdrive')
```

3. After running this code, you'll be provided with a link to get an authorization code. Click on the link, allow access, and then copy the authorization code that is provided.

4. Paste the authorization code into the input box in your Google Colab notebook and press Enter.

5. Now your Google Drive is mounted, and you can access your files from Google Colab. You can check the files in your Google Drive with the following code:

```python
!ls "/content/gdrive/My Drive"
```

6. Now, you can run TensorBoard with the path to the logs in your Google Drive. Replace `path/to/logs` with the actual path to your tfevent files in your Google Drive.

```python
%tensorboard --logdir="/content/gdrive/My Drive/path/to/logs"
```

This should solve your issue. If you still encounter problems, please let me know.
