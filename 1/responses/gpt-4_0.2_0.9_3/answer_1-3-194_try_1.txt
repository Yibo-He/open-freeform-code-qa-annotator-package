You can use the `openpyxl` or `pandas` library in Python to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is an example using `openpyxl`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active

for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

And here is an example using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

df = pd.DataFrame(new_list)

df.to_excel('file_name.xlsx', index=False, header=False)
```

Both of these scripts will create a new Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write the data from `new_list` into it. The `pandas` method is generally simpler and more powerful, but requires that you have the `pandas` and `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter` libraries installed. The `openpyxl` method only requires the `openpyxl` library.
