You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is how you can do it:

First, install the library using pip:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to write your list of lists into an Excel file:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active

# Write the data to the worksheet
for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

# Save the workbook
wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

This will create an Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write your list of lists into it. The `ws.cell` method is used to write a value to a specific cell, specified by its row and column numbers. The `row` and `column` parameters are 1-indexed, so we add 1 to the indices from the list.
