The behavior you're describing is not typical for Python. The line of code you provided is not valid Python syntax. 

```python
[0xfor x in (1, 2, 3)]
```

This line of code should raise a `SyntaxError` because `0xfor` is not a valid hexadecimal number nor a valid Python identifier. 

If you're seeing a different result, it's possible that you're either not running the code you think you're running, or your Python environment is somehow modified or corrupted. 

If you want to create a list of zeros with the same length as the tuple `(1, 2, 3)`, you can use a list comprehension like this:

```python
[0 for x in (1, 2, 3)]
```

This will correctly return `[0, 0, 0]`.
