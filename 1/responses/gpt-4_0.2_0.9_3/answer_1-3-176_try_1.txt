The error message indicates that the zlib library is missing. This is a common issue when installing Pillow on Windows, as it requires some additional dependencies that are not included in the standard Python distribution.

Here are the steps to solve this problem:

1. Uninstall the existing Pillow library if it's already installed. You can do this by running `pip uninstall pillow`.

2. Download the Pillow package that corresponds to your Python version and system architecture from this link: https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pillow. For example, if you're using Python 3.8 on a 64-bit system, you would download the file `Pillow‑8.3.2‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl`.

3. Navigate to the directory where you downloaded the .whl file in the command prompt.

4. Install the downloaded .whl file using pip. For example, if you downloaded `Pillow‑8.3.2‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl`, you would run `pip install Pillow‑8.3.2‑cp38‑cp38‑win_amd64.whl`.

This should install Pillow with all the necessary dependencies. If you still encounter issues, please let me know!
