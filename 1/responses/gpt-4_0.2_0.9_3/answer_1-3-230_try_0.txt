The `_io.BytesIO` object is a stream of bytes in memory. You can get the bytes from it by calling the `getvalue()` method. Here is how you can modify your function:

```python
def uncompress_body(self, compression_type, body):
    if isinstance(body, _io.BytesIO):
        body = body.getvalue()
        
    if compression_type == 'gzip' or compression_type == 'compress':
        return zlib.decompress(body)
    elif compression_type == 'deflate':
        compressor = zlib.compressobj(9, zlib.DEFLATED, -zlib.MAX_WBITS)
        compressed = compressor.compress(body)
        compressed += compressor.flush()
        return base64.b64encode(compressed)

    return body
```

In this code, if the `body` is an instance of `_io.BytesIO`, it gets converted to bytes using the `getvalue()` method. This will return the entire contents of the BytesIO object as bytes which can then be used by the `zlib.decompress()` function.
