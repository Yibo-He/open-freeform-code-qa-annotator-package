The error message you're seeing suggests that there's a file in your dataset that TensorFlow is unable to read as an image. Even though you've checked that all your images are in JPEG format, there might be a corrupted file or a file with a wrong extension in your dataset.

Here are a few steps you can take to debug this issue:

1. **Check for hidden files**: Sometimes, hidden files like `.DS_Store` on MacOS can cause this error. Make sure to remove these files from your dataset.

2. **Check for corrupted files**: There might be a corrupted JPEG file in your dataset. You can use a tool like `jpeginfo` to check for and remove corrupted files.

3. **Check file extensions**: Make sure all your files have the correct `.jpg` extension. Sometimes, files might be saved with a different extension but are actually in a different format.

Here is a Python script that you can use to check for non-JPEG files in your dataset:

```python
import os
from PIL import Image

folder_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/fi_dataset/train'

for filename in os.listdir(folder_path):
    if filename.endswith('.jpg'):
        try:
            img = Image.open(os.path.join(folder_path, filename)) # open the image file
            img.verify() # verify that it is, in fact an image
        except (IOError, SyntaxError) as e:
            print('Bad file:', filename) # print out the names of corrupt files
```

This script will print out the names of any files that cannot be opened as JPEG images, which should help you identify any problematic files in your dataset.
