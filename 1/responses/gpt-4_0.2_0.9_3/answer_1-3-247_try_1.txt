The error message is indicating that Django is trying to reverse the URL for 'profile' with an empty string as the argument, but it can't find a match because your URL pattern expects a string.

This is happening because `post.author.username` is empty for at least one of your `NewPost` objects. When Django tries to create the URL for the profile link, it's passing an empty string as the argument, which doesn't match your URL pattern.

To fix this, you could add a check in your template to only create the link if `post.author.username` exists:

```html
{% for post in posts %}
    <div class="card">
        <div class="card-body"> Title: {{post.title}} </div>
        <div class="card-body"> Description: {{post.description}}</div>
        <p> {{post.author.username}} </p>
        <div class="card-body">
            {% if post.author.username %}
                <a href="{% url 'profile' post.author.username %}">
                    @{{post.author.username}}
                </a>
            {% endif %}
        </div>
    </div>
{% endfor %}
```

This will prevent the error from occurring, but you might want to investigate why `post.author.username` is empty. It could be that you have `NewPost` objects that were created without an associated `User`, or `User` objects that were created without a username.
