The error message you're seeing is indicating that the path to your Python interpreter is not valid. Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter path**: In VSCode, you can select the Python interpreter by clicking on the Python version in the bottom-left of the status bar, or by using the `Python: Select Interpreter` command from the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`). Make sure the selected interpreter is the one you want to use and that the path is correct.

2. **Update your `launch.json` file**: The `python` field in your `launch.json` file should point to the Python interpreter you want to use. You can use the `${command:python.interpreterPath}` variable, which should resolve to the path of the currently selected interpreter. If this doesn't work, try replacing it with the actual path to your Python interpreter. For example:

```json
{
    "version": "0.2.0",
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "Python: Current File",
            "type": "python",
            "request": "launch",
            "program": "${file}",
            "console": "integratedTerminal",
            "pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python3"
        }
    ]
}
```

3. **Check your `settings.json` file**: The `python.pythonPath` setting in your `settings.json` file should also point to the correct Python interpreter. If it doesn't, update it to the correct path.

```json
{
    "python.pythonPath": "/usr/local/bin/python3"
}
```

4. **Reinstall the Python extension**: If none of the above steps work, there might be an issue with your Python extension. Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VSCode.

Remember to replace `"/usr/local/bin/python3"` with the actual path to your Python interpreter. You can find this path by running `which python3` (on Unix-based systems) or `where python` (on Windows) in a terminal.
