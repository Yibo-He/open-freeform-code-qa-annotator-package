The error you're encountering is due to pip trying to uninstall a version of llvmlite that was installed by conda. Pip does not have the permissions to uninstall this package.

Here are a few steps you can try:

1. Create a new conda environment and install librosa in that environment. This will isolate your installation and prevent conflicts with other packages. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.7
conda activate myenv
pip install librosa
```

2. If you want to install librosa in your base environment, you can try installing it with conda instead of pip:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge librosa
```

3. If you still want to use pip, you can try to force the installation without dependencies, and then install the dependencies manually:

```bash
pip install --no-deps librosa
```

Then you can install the dependencies one by one. You can find the list of dependencies in the [librosa documentation](https://librosa.org/doc/main/install.html).

Remember to always activate your conda environment before installing any packages.
