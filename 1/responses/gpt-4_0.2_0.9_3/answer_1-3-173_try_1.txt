Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `is_leap_year` property of the `dt` accessor to check if the year is a leap year or not. Here is an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas series with your dates
dates = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']))

# Use the is_leap_year property to get a boolean series
# where True indicates a leap year and False a non-leap year
leap_years = dates.dt.is_leap_year

# Use the boolean series to select the number of days in the year
days_in_year = leap_years.replace({True: 366, False: 365})

print(days_in_year)
```

In this code, `dates.dt.is_leap_year` returns a series with the same index as `dates` where each value is `True` if the corresponding date is in a leap year and `False` otherwise. Then, `leap_years.replace({True: 366, False: 365})` replaces `True` with 366 and `False` with 365, giving the number of days in the year for each date.
