Yes, `pip` will continue to work for Python 2.7 even after its end of life. You will still be able to install packages using `pip install abc==1.2.3`. However, it's important to note that while `pip` will continue to work, individual package maintainers may choose to stop supporting Python 2.7. This means that newer versions of packages may not be compatible with Python 2.7.

Also, the Python Package Index (PyPI) will continue to serve Python 2 packages. The Python Software Foundation has not announced any plans to stop hosting Python 2.7 packages on PyPI.

However, it's strongly recommended to upgrade to Python 3 as soon as possible, as Python 2.7 will not receive any security updates or bug fixes, making any code running on it potentially vulnerable.
