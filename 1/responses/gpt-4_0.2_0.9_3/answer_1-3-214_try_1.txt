It seems like you have already solved your problem by updating the pandas-profiling package to the latest version. The issue was likely due to a compatibility problem between the version of pandas and pandas-profiling you were using.

For future reference, here are some general steps to troubleshoot similar issues:

1. **Check your package versions**: Make sure that the versions of your packages are compatible with each other. You can check the version of a package by using `print(pandas.__version__)` for pandas, and `print(pandas_profiling.__version__)` for pandas-profiling.

2. **Update your packages**: If your packages are not up-to-date, you can update them using pip or conda. For pip, use `pip install --upgrade package-name`. For conda, use `conda update package-name`.

3. **Check the documentation**: The documentation of a package often contains information about which versions of other packages it is compatible with. 

4. **Search for the error message**: If you get an error message, try searching for it online. There's a good chance someone else has had the same problem and found a solution.

5. **Ask for help**: If you can't find a solution, don't hesitate to ask for help. You can ask a question on Stack Overflow, or on the GitHub page of the package.
