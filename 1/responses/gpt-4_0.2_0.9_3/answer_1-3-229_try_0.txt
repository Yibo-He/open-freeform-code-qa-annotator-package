Unfortunately, as of now, the Visual Studio Code Jupyter extension does not support find and replace within a single cell. The Ctrl+H shortcut will indeed replace all occurrences in the entire Jupyter notebook file.

However, you can use Python's built-in string methods to replace text within a string. For example, you can use the `str.replace()` method to replace all occurrences of a substring within a string.

Here's an example:

```python
text = "Hello, world!"
new_text = text.replace("world", "VS Code")
print(new_text)  # Outputs: "Hello, VS Code!"
```

In this example, all occurrences of "world" in the `text` string are replaced with "VS Code".

If you're working with a pandas DataFrame, you can use the `df.replace()` method to replace values.

Here's an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

data = {'A': [1, 2, 3], 'B': [4, 5, 6]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

df = df.replace(1, 100)

print(df)
```

In this example, all occurrences of 1 in the DataFrame are replaced with 100.

I understand this might not be the exact solution you're looking for, but I hope it helps until the feature you're looking for is implemented in the VS Code Jupyter extension.
