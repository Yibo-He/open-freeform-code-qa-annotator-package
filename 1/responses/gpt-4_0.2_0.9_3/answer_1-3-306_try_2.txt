The `diff` object you have is a dictionary, not a DataFrame. The `to_csv` method is a pandas DataFrame method, which is why you're getting an error. 

You can convert the dictionary to a DataFrame and then save it to a csv file. However, since your dictionary contains lists of dictionaries for the 'added' and 'removed' keys, you will need to handle these separately. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Convert the 'added' and 'removed' lists of dictionaries to DataFrames
added_df = pd.DataFrame(diff['added'])
removed_df = pd.DataFrame(diff['removed'])

# Add a new column to each DataFrame to indicate the action
added_df['action'] = 'added'
removed_df['action'] = 'removed'

# Concatenate the two DataFrames
diff_df = pd.concat([added_df, removed_df])

# Save the DataFrame to a csv file
diff_df.to_csv('diff.csv', index=False)
```

This will create a csv file where each row represents an item that was either added or removed, and there is an additional column called 'action' that indicates what happened to the item.

If you also want to include the 'changed' items, you can do so in a similar way. Just remember that the 'changed' key in the dictionary contains a list of pairs of dictionaries, where the first dictionary in each pair represents the original item and the second dictionary represents the changed item. You will need to handle these pairs appropriately when creating the DataFrame.
