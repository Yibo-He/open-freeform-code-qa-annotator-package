Yes, it's possible to print text with an RGB colored background in Python. You can use the ANSI escape code `\033[48;2;r;g;bm` to set the background color, where `r`, `g`, and `b` are the RGB values. Here is how you can modify your function to set the background color:

```python
def colored_bg(r, g, b, text):
    return "\033[48;2;{};{};{}m{} \033[0m".format(r, g, b, text)

text = "Hello, World"
colored_text = colored_bg(132, 204, 247, text)
print(colored_text)
```

This will print the text "Hello, World" with a background color of RGB(132, 204, 247). The `\033[0m` at the end resets the background color to the terminal's default.

Please note that this might not work on all terminals. Some terminals might not support 24-bit color and will fall back to the nearest 8-bit color.
