The errors you're encountering are due to incompatibilities between different versions of TensorFlow, NumPy, and possibly other libraries. Here are some steps you can take to resolve these issues:

1. **Create a new virtual environment**: This is generally a good practice to avoid conflicts between different projects that may require different versions of the same libraries. You can use `conda` or `virtualenv` to create a new environment.

2. **Install the correct versions of the libraries**: TensorFlow 2.2.0 requires NumPy version >=1.16.0 and <1.19.0. So, you can try installing NumPy 1.18.5 which is the latest version in this range. You can do this with the following command:

    ```
    pip install numpy==1.18.5
    ```

3. **Reinstall TensorFlow**: After installing the correct version of NumPy, reinstall TensorFlow 2.2.0 with the following command:

    ```
    pip install tensorflow==2.2.0
    ```

4. **Reinstall pycocotools**: The second error you're encountering is related to the `pycocotools` library. You can try reinstalling it with the following command:

    ```
    pip install pycocotools
    ```

5. **Check other dependencies**: Make sure that other libraries required by your project are installed and their versions are compatible with TensorFlow 2.2.0.

After following these steps, try running your script again. If you still encounter errors, please provide the full error messages and I'll be glad to help you further.
