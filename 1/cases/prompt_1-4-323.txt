Extract all row.names in a data.frame that match a value in another data.frame

I have a data.frame with 150 column names. For each column, I want to extract the maximum and minimum values (the rows repeat) and the row names of each maximum value. I have extracted the min and max values in another data.frame but don't know how to match them.
I have found functions that are very close for this, like for minimum values:
```
head(cars)
  speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
3     7    4
4     7   22
5     8   16
6     9   10

sapply(cars,which.min)

speed  dist 
    1     1
```

Here, it only gives the first index for minimum speed.
And I've tried with loops like:
```
for (i in (colnames(cars))){
  print(min(cars[[i]]))
}


[1] 4
[1] 2
```

But that just gives me the minimum values, and not if they are repeated and the rowname of each repeated value.
I want something like:
```
min.value  column  rowname   freq.times
4          speed      1,2        2
2          dist       1          1
```

Thanks and sorry if I have orthography mistakes. No native speaker
