Python: String to CamelCase

This is a question from Codewars:
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

The input test cases are as follows:

```
test.describe("Testing function to_camel_case")
test.it("Basic tests")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case(''), '', "An empty string was provided but not returned")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"), "theStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') did not return correct value")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"), "TheStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') did not return correct value")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("A-B-C"), "ABC", "to_camel_case('A-B-C') did not return correct value")
```


This is what I've tried so far:

```
def to_camel_case(text):
    str=text
    str=str.replace(' ','')
    for i in str:
        if ( str[i] == '-'):
            str[i]=str.replace('-','')
            str[i+1].toUpperCase()
        elif ( str[i] == '_'):
            str[i]=str.replace('-','')
            str[i+1].toUpperCase()
    return str
```


It passes the first two tests but not the main ones :

```
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"), "theStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') did not return correct value")
    test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"), "TheStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') did not return correct value")
    test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("A-B-C"), "ABC", "to_camel_case('A-B-C') did not return correct value")
```


What am I doing wrong?
