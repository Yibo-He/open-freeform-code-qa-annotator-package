Using Playwright for Python, how do I select an option from a drop down list?

This is a followup to this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64303326/using-playwright-for-python-how-do-i-select-or-find-an-element) on the basic functionality of Playwright for Python.
How do I  an  from a ?
This example remote controls a vuejs-webseite that has a drop down list of fruits like "Apple", "Banana", "Carrot", "Orange"
Here I want to select the option "Banana"
```
from playwright import sync_playwright
import time

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)
    handle = page.querySelector(new_selector)

    # at this point I have the element and can print the content
    print(handle.innerHTML())
```

The drop down list HTML like this
```
<select data-v-c2cef47a="" id="name-fruit" autocomplete="true" class="form-select__select">
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" disabled="disabled" value=""><!----></option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Apple </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Banana </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Carrot </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Orange </option> 
</select>
```

in Selenium, I would select an option like this
```
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
Select(handle).select_by_visible_text('Banana')  # Note: no spaces needed!
```

The Javascript docs for Playwright have this, which is not exactly the same, because it seems to identify the object at the same time.
```
// Single selection matching the label
await page.selectOption('select#colors', { label: 'Blue' });
```

How do I do the selection in Playwright for Python?
I tried both of these and nothing happens.
```
handle.selectOption("text=Banana") 
handle.selectOption("text= Banana ")
```
