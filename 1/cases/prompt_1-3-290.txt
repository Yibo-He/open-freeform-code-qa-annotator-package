How to get SHAP values for each class on a multiclass classification problem in python

I have the following dataframe:
```
import pandas as pd
import random

import xgboost
import shap

foo = pd.DataFrame({'id':[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10],
                   'var1':random.sample(range(1, 100), 10),
                   'var2':random.sample(range(1, 100), 10),
                   'var3':random.sample(range(1, 100), 10),
                   'class': ['a','a','a','a','a','b','b','c','c','c']})
```

For which I want to run a classification algorithm in order to predict the 3 `class`es
So I split my dataset into train and test and I run an xgboost
```
cl_cols = foo.filter(regex='var').columns
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(foo[cl_cols],
                                                        foo[['class']],
                                                        test_size=0.33, random_state=42)


model = xgboost.XGBClassifier(objective="binary:logistic")
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

Now I would like to get the mean SHAP values , instead of the mean from the  SHAP values generated from this code:
```
shap_values = shap.TreeExplainer(model).shap_values(X_test)
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test)
```

Also, the plot labels the `class` as 0,1,2. How can I know to which `class` from the original do the 0,1 & 2 correspond ?
Because this code:
```
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test,
                 class_names= ['a', 'b', 'c'])
```

gives

and this code:
```
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X_test,
                 class_names= ['b', 'c', 'a'])
```

gives

So I am not sure about the legend anymore.
Any ideas ?
