How can I make a discontinuous axis in R with ggplot2?

I have a dataframe (`dat`) with two columns 1) `Month` and 2) `Value`. I would like to highlight that the x-axis is not continuous in my boxplot by interrupting the x-axis with two angled lines on the x-axis that are empty between the angled lines.
Example Data and Boxplot
```
library(ggplot2)
set.seed(321)
dat <- data.frame(matrix(ncol = 2, nrow = 18))
x <- c("Month", "Value")
colnames(dat) <- x
dat$Month <- rep(c(1,2,3,10,11,12),3)
dat$Value <- rnorm(18,20,2)

ggplot(data = dat, aes(x = factor(Month), y = Value)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  labs(x = "Month") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(),
        text = element_text(size = 16),
        axis.text.x = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"),
        axis.text.y = element_text(size = 14, color = "black"))
```

The ideal figure would look something like below. How can I make this discontinuous axis in ggplot?
