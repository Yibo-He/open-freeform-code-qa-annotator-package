Terraform Import of map resources

I've got a map variable that identifies existing s3 buckets:
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  #other configuration
}

variable "s3_replication" {
  description = "Map of buckets to replicate"
  type        = map
  default = {
    logs = {
      source = "logs_bucket",
      destination = "central_logs_bucket"
    },
    security = {
      source = "cloudtrail_bucket",
      destination = "central_security_bucket"
    }
  }
}
```

Since these buckets already exist, I am trying to import them and then apply the a configuration to them to update the resources. Unfortunately, I am not able to figure out how to do a terraform import on these. I've tried:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[logs] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0].source logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0[source]] logs_bucket
```

All failing with a different error. Any idea on how to import existing resources listed on a map?
