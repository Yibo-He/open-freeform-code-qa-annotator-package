Python - convert binary mask to polygon

Given a simple binary mask (e.g. the boundary of a rectangle).

How can I use a polygon to get the x-y coordinates?

This is what I have tried so far:

```
coords = np.transpose(np.nonzero(mask))
```


However, this approach generates a filled object and not the desired boundary.

```
plt.plot(coords[:, 1], coords[:,0])
```

Basically, I want a list of x-y coordinates of the white pixels to use this list to re-draw the rectangle (not filled).
