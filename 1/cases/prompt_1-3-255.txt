ERROR: Could not build wheels for opencv-python which use PEP 517 and cannot be installed directly

I was trying to install OpenCV4 in a docker on jetson nano. It has jetpack 4.4 s os. The docker was successfully created and Tensorflow is running but while installing OpenCV using pip it is showing CMake error.
