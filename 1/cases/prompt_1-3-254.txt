Plotly: How to add text labels to a histogram?

Is there a way how to display the counted value of the histogram aggregate in the Plotly.Express histogram?
`px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({"A":[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]}),x="A")`

If I would use regular histogram, I can specify `text` parameter which direct to the column which contain the value to display.
`px.bar(pd.DataFrame({"val":[1,2,3,4,5], "height": [3,2,3,3,1]}), x="val", y="height", text="height")`

But with histograms, this value is calculated and it's not even part of the `fig.to_dict()`. Is there a way to add the text labels into histogram?
