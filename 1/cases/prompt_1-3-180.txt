pandas groupby column that has specific value

hi im working with dataset in pandas.
lets say the dataset having
ID,
TEST_TYPE,
TEST_STATUS,
TEST_DATE,
etc
i need to group a kind of column so first i try
```
data_useless[['TEST_TYPE', 'TEST_STATUS']].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count_values()
```

and it worked : showing the result of grouped data by test_status(FAILED TEST and PASS TEST) and count value of that data on dataset
now i want to know and see the data more from the PASS TEST
so i tried
```
data_useless.groupby(['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST')
```

and it not working.. showing error, it say 
i need to do something like
in sql :
```
SELECT *
FROM data_useless
WHERE TEST_STATUS = "PASS TEST"
group by TEST_STATUS;
```

please help,,,
