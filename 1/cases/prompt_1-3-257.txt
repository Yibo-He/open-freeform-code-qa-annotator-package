Dividing an even number into N parts each part being a multiple of 2

Let's assume I have the number `100` which I need to divide into N parts each of which shouldn't exceed 30 initially. So the initial grouping would be (30,30,30). The remainder (which is 10) is to be distributed among these three groups by adding 2 to each group in succession, thus ensuring that each group is a multiple of 2. The desired output should therefore look like (34,34,32).
Note: The original number is always even.
I tried solving this in Python and this is what I came up with. Clearly it's not working in the way I thought it would. It distributes the remainder by adding 1 (and not 2, as desired) iteratively to each group.
```
num = 100
parts = num//30  #Number of parts into which 'num' is to be divided

def split(a, b):
  result = ([a//b + 1] * (a%b) + [a//b] * (b - a%b))
  return(result)

print(split(num, parts))
```

Output:
```
[34, 33, 33]
```

Desired output:
```
[34, 34, 32]
```
