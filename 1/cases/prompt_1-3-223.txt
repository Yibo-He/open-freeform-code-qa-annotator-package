How to check if python package is latest version programmatically?

How do you check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in a script and return a true or false?

I can check with a script like this:

```
package='gekko'
import pip
if hasattr(pip, 'main'):
    from pip import main as pipmain
else:
    from pip._internal import main as pipmain
pipmain(['search','gekko'])
```


or with command line: 

```
(base) C:\User>pip search gekko
gekko (0.2.3)  - Machine learning and optimization for dynamic systems
  INSTALLED: 0.2.3 (latest)
```


But how do I check programmatically and return true or false?
