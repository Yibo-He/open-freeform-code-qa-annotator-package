Barplot for count data with multiple columns

I have a dataframe that looks something like this:
Columns with data:
```
Sex     Var1  Var2   Var3
Male     Yes    No    Yes
Female    No   Yes     No
Male      No    No    Yes
Female   Yes   Yes     No
```

I want to create a barplot with two bars for each Variable (one for Males, one for Females) in the X axis and the "Yes" count in the Y axis and I don't really know how. Any help would be much appreciated.
