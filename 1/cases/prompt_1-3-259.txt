Brighten only dark areas of image in python

I am trying to process images and I would like to brighten the dark areas of my image. I tried Histogram Equalization, however as there are also some bright areas in the image, the result is not satisfying. This is why I am looking for a way to brighten  of the image.
As an example, Input image is on the left and the expected result is on the right, the hair and face of the girl are brightened

ImageMagick seems to offer some possibilities to achieve this, however, I would like to do it using python
