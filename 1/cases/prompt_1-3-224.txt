Filter a list containing specific string


I have a specific set of a long list containing many asset pairs with different endings: `BTCUSDT` `ETHBTC` `ANKRETH`... From this list, I would like to filter out the symbols ending with USDT.

I have tried using `filter` and `all` with iterations, however, none provides the exact result.
Here are my attempts:

```
my_set = ['LUNAUSDT', 'ETHBTC', 'ETHBNB', 'BTCUSDT', 'MANATUSD', 'ALICEETH' ]
my_set = [word for word in symbols if 'USDT' in my_set]
my_set
```

> This results in an empty set.

```
keyword = ['USDT']
my_set = ['LUNAUSDT', 'ETHBTC', 'ETHBNB', 'BTCUSDT', 'MANATUSD', 'ALICEETH' ]
final = [ x for x in my_set in all(keyword in keyword for keyword in my_set)]
final
```

This results in the error:
> TypeError: argument of type 'bool' is not iterable

```
my_final_set = filter(lambda x:x.endswith(("USDT")), my_set)
my_final_set
```

> This shows: <filter at 0x7fe537eebf10>
I basically want my final list with all symbols ending with `USDT`

```
my_set = ['LUNAUSDT', 'ETHBTC', 'ETHBNB', 'BTCUSDT', 'MANATUSD', 'ALICEETH' ]
```

results in: `['LUNAUSDT', 'BTCUSDT']`
Any help or advice on what I'm doing wrong would be massively appreciated. Thanks in advance!
