What is "random-state" in sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split example?

Can someone explain me what `random_state` means in below example?
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = np.arange(10).reshape((5, 2)), range(5)


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
```

Why is it hard coded to 42?
