How to replace environment variable value in yaml file to be parsed using python script

I need to use environment variable "PATH" in yaml file which needs to be parsed with a script.  

This is the environment variable I have set on my terminal:

```
$ echo $PATH
/Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork
```


This is my sample.yml:

```
---
Top: ${PATH}/my.txt
Vars:
- a
- b
```


When I parse this yaml file with my script, I don't see `PATH` variables actual value. 

This is my script:

```
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.load_all(stream)
for doc in docs:
    for k,v in doc.items():
        print k, "->", v
    print "\n",
```


Output:

```
Top -> ${PATH}/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```


Expected output is:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```


Can someone help me figuring out the correct way to do it if I am doing it wrong way?
