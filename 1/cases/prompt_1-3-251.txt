Problem with pip install mariadb - mariadb_config not found

I have been trying to run `pip3 install mariadb` on my raspberry pi running ubuntu 18.04 and I was unsuccessful.
I have tried installing following packages as suggested in other answers:
```
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

pip3 install mysqlclient
pip3 install mysql-connector-python-rf
```

However, I'm still running intto the problem as shown:
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ pip3 install mariadb
