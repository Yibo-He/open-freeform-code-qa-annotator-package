I run drive.py program from [Code Project | A Complete guide to self driving car](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1273179/A-Complete-guide-to-self-driving-Car?fbclid=IwAR1L7mOaPTZ7-vwWicXcAS7FLhVLcU9BUgaivhK0P9tbXAGe0zOThAuktMs)
but when i start program i have error:
Not creating XLA devices, tf_xla_enable_xla_devices not set
Does anyone know how I can fix this problem? What should I download or reinstall?
I use:
Python 3.8.7
CUDA 11.0
tensorflow 2.4.1
On [http://0.0.0.0:4567/](http://0.0.0.0:4567/) of course I see nothing
