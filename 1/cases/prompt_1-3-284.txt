Tensorboard not found as magic function in jupyter

I want to run tensorboard in jupyter using the latest tensorflow 2.0.0a0. 
With the tensorboard version 1.13.1, and python 3.6. 

using 

`... %tensorboard --logdir {logs_base_dir}`

I get the error :

`UsageError: Line magic function %tensorboard not found`

Do you have an idea what the problem could be? It seems that all versions are up to date and the command seems correct too. 

Thanks
