Put logo and title above/on top of page navigation in sidebar of streamlit multipage app

I am using the new [multipage feature](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/multipage-apps) and would like to style my multipage app and put a logo with a title on top of/before the page navigation.
Here's a small example tested on `Python 3.9` with `streamlit==1.11.1` in the following directory structure:
```
/Home.py
/pages/Page_1.py
/pages/Page_2.py
```

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st


st.sidebar.markdown(
    "My Logo (sidebar) should be on top of the Navigation within the sidebar"
)

st.markdown("# Home")
```

`Page_1.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 2")
```

which I can run using:
```
$ streamlit run Home.py
```

But this leads to the Text printed  and not  the navigation:

Is there any way to do this? Any hints are welcome!
Best wishes,
