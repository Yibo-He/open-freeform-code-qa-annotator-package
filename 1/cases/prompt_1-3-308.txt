Cannot install librosa python, how can I uninstall llvmlite?

I have recently tried to install `librosa` on Windows using `pip install librosa`. Nevertheless, this error appears:

> Cannot uninstall 'llvmlite'. It is a distutils installed project and
  thus we cannot accurately determine which files belong to it which
  would lead to only a partial uninstall.

As a solution, I have executed `conda update --all`, and `conda install numba=0.39.0`, without any improvement.

Thank you in advanced.
