How to repeat the input until a special condition is met in Python?

I need to take integer inputs from the user and add them to a set. The number of integers is unknown. The input process will end when the user input is "Done".
Here is my code:
```
s = set()
print('Please type the number, when you are done please type "Done":')
while True:
    try:
        a = int(input())
        s.add(a)
    except:
        if a == "Done":
            break
        else:
            print('Integer only, please re-type:')
            continue
print(s)
```

But it didn't work as intended.
My idea is simple. If the user types an integer then it's fine, just add to set `s`. If they type a string (which `int(input()` is wrong), then it will go down to `except`, if the string is "Done", then break the `while True` loop, if it isn't then ask the user to re-type and continue the loop.
Here is the error if I type a string first and if I type normally:

I tried to use a simple if-else statement at the start but it causes traceback right at `int(input())`.
