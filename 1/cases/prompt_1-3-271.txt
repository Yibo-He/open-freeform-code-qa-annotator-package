Python split string by multiple delimiters following a hierarchy

I want to split strings only once based on multiple delimiters like "and", "&" and "-" in that order. Example:
```
'121 34 adsfd' -> ['121 34 adsfd']
'dsfsd and adfd' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
'dsfsd & adfd' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
'dsfsd - adfd' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd']
'dsfsd and adfd and adsfa' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd and adsfa']
'dsfsd and adfd - adsfa' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd - adsfa']
'dsfsd - adfd and adsfa' -> ['dsfsd - adfd ', ' adsfa']
```

I tried the below code to achieve this:
```
import re
re.split('and|&|-', string, maxsplit=1)
```

It works for all cases except the last one. As it does not follow the hierarchy, for the last one it returns:
```
'dsfsd - adfd and adsfa' -> ['dsfsd ', ' adfd and adsfa']
```

How can I achieve this?
