How to check that a string contains only “a-z”, “A-Z” and “0-9” characters

I am importing string and trying to check if text contains only "a-z", "A-Z", and "0-9".

But I get only input and it doesn't print success when I enter letters and digits

```
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if text in correct:
    print("Success")
```
