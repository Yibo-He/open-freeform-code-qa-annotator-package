To invert colours from black to white in opencv python

I have a condition where I want to detect white line incase of black background and black line incase of white background. I used bitwise_not operation something like this:

```
cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black)
```


It is working perfectly until and unless i give a condition like this:

```
if mask_black == cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black):
```


I get an error

> ValueError: The truth value of an array with more than one element is ambiguous. Use a.any() or a.all()

I am having doubts about using conditions where if black background occurs white line is to be detected and if white background occurs black line is to be detected

```
mask_black = cv2.inRange(hsv, low_black, high_black)
mask_not=cv2.bitwise_not(mask_black)

if mask_black==cv2.bitwise_and(mask_black, mask_not):
    body 
else:
    body
```


This is returning the above error
