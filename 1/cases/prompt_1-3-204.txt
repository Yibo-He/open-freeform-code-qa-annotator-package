Python renaming Pandas DataFrame Columns

```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
datain = np.loadtxt(datafile)
df = pd.DataFrame(data = datain, columns = ["t","p","x","y","z"])
avg = df.groupby(["t"], sort=False)["p"].mean().rename(columns={1:"mean"})
```


This doesn't work, it tells me TypeError: rename() got an unexpected keyword argument "columns". It also doesn't work if I do this,

```
avg.rename(columns = {1:"mean"}, inplace=True)
```


I cannot figure out why, all documentation tells me that my columns call is correct. I just want to rename the blank column created by my "mean" call to have a string index. Anyone know why or how to fix this? All examples I've seen follow this format. Thanks.
