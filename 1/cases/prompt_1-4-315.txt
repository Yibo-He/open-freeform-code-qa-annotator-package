Concatenate every two columns in dataframe

I have the following data frame:
```
X1   X2   X3   X4   X5   X6   X7
p1   H    I    K    J    K    H
p2   H    K    J    K    I    J
p3   J    K    H    I    J    K
p4   K    I    H    J    I    J
```

I want to create a new data frame with the column `X1` and concatenate every two columns starting from `X2` so the final table looks like:
```
X1   X2    X3    X4   
p1   HI    KJ    KH
p2   HK    JK    IJ
p3   JK    HI    JK
p4   KI    HJ    IJ
```
