DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated selenium python

I am using sublime to code python scripts. The following code is for selenium in python to install the driver automatically by using the webdriver_manager package
```
# pip install webdriver-manager
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.chrome.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.chrome import ChromeDriverManager
from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
driver.maximize_window()

#s=Service(path)
#driver=webdriver.Chrome(service=s)
driver.get('https://www.google.com')
driver.find_element(By.NAME, 'q').send_keys('Yasser Khalil')
```

The code works fine but I got a warning like that
```
Demo.py:7: DeprecationWarning: executable_path has been deprecated, please pass in a Service object
  driver = webdriver.Chrome(ChromeDriverManager().install())
```

How to fix such a bug?
