Split a string if character is present else don't split

I have a `string` like below in `python`
```
testing_abc
```

I want to split string based on `_` and extract the `2` element
I have done like below
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I am getting the correct output as expected
```
abc
```

Now I want this to work for below strings
```
1) xyz
```

When I use
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get below error
```
list index out of range
```

expected output I want is `xyz`
```
2) testing_abc_bbc
```

When I use
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get `abc` as output
expected output I want is `abc_bbc`
Basically What I want is
```
1) If string contains `_` then print everything after the first `_` as variable
2) If string doesn't contain `_` then print the string as variable
```

How can I achieve what I want
