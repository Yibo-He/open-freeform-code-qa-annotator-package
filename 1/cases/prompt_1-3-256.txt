Will PIP work for python 2.7 after its End of Life on 1st Jan 2020

Python 2.7 is reaching its end of life on 1st Jan, 2020 as mentioned by 

[https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)

Will current `pip` keep on working for python 2.7 after that date? It is already showing the msg for deprecation of python 2.7. Will we be able to run
`pip install abc==1.2.3` after that date?

We do understand that after EOL, no new fixes/support will be done for 2.7, so that is not the concern here. 

The question stems from the desire to keep running on python 2.7 even after EOL.
