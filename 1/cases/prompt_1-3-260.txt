ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'bs4' [BeautifulSoup]

I was trying to run a simple python file using BeautifulSoup when I received the following error message in Atom.

I have already installed BeautifulSoup using the following command in my Macbook's terminal.
```
$ pip3 install beautifulsoup4
```

I want to note that I have both Python 2.7.10 and Python 3.8.5 installed. I looked at my installed modules, and I only see 'bs4' in the modules for python3 and not in python.
When I try to place  in Atom or PyCharm, both text editors say that the module  exist. Any help would be much appreciated, thank you.



```
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
```



```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/Users/lyons/Documents/scrape/scrape.py", line 2, in <module>
    from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
