Use dplyr's if_else function with functional true/false values


## Question


How can dplyr's `if_else()` function be used such that its output is a function? With `ifelse()` from `base` this is trivial but with `if_else()` something goes wrong. Is that intended behavior or am I just not able to do that properly?

## Reprex


```
x <- 2
ifelse(x == 2, min, max)
#> function (..., na.rm = FALSE)  .Primitive("min")
dplyr::if_else(x == 2, min, max)
#> Error in true[rep(NA_integer_, length(condition))]: object of type 'builtin' is not subsettable
```
