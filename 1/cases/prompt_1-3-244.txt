printing with RGB background

I know its possible to print RGB colored text like so:
```
def colored(r, g, b, text):
    return "\033[38;2;{};{};{}m{} \033[39m".format(r, g, b, text)


text = "Hello, World"
colored_text = colored(132, 204, 247, text)
print(colored_text)
```

But, is there a way to print with RGB colored ?
Cuz, as far as I know, there are a few kinda built-in background colors for printing. But I want to be able to use rgb codes and get the appropriate background color for the printed text.
Is this possible?
Thanks.
