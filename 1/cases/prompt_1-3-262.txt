pip3 "TypeError: 'module' object is not callable" after update

I am new in Python, I wanna install Jupyter Notebook in my console I enter the following:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
```


after that I have a error to use pip3 install other library, the console print: 

```
File "/usr/bin/pip3", line 11, in <module>
    sys.exit(main())
TypeError: 'module' object is not callable
```


I don't know what I have to do. 

I use `sudo autoremove python3-pip` after that I use `sudo apt install python3-pip`
