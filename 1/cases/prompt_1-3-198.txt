Pandas: How to read CSV file from google drive public?

I searched similar questions about reading csv from URL but I could not find a way to read csv file from google drive csv file.

My attempt:

```
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
dfs = pd.read_html(url)
```


How can we read this file in pandas?
