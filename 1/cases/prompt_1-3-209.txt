How to add a mean line to a seaborn stripplot or swarmplot

I have a rather simple strip plot with vertical data.
```
planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")
sns.stripplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, size=4, color=".7")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.show()
```

I want to plot the mean of each x-element (`method`) as a small horizontal bar similar to what you get with:
```
sns.boxplot(
    x="method",
    y="distance",
    data=planets,
    whis=[50, 50],
    showfliers=False,
    showbox=False,
    showcaps=False
)
```

But without the vertical lines (with `whis=[50,50]` just spots) for the first / third quartile and showing mean instead of median. Maybe there is a more elegant solution not involving a Boxplot.
Thanks in advance.
