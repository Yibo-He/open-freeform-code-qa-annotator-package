Errors running Pandas Profile Report

I'm trying to run a Profile Report for EDA in conda Jupyter NB, but keep getting errors.
Here is my code thus far:

```
import pandas_profiling
    from pandas_profiling import ProfileReport

    profile = ProfileReport(data)
```


and 

```
profile = pandas_profiling.ProfileReport(data)
```


both of which produce:    

> TypeError: concat() got an unexpected keyword argument 'join_axes'  

Research recommended upgrading to Pandas 1.0, which I'm using. 

Also tried

```
data.profile_report()
```


> AttributeError: 'DataFrame' object has no attribute 'profile_report'  

Any tips on where I am going wrong?  

Addendum...So I finally figured it out. Needed to install latest version of pandas-profiling in conda, which was 202003 version. Too easy.
