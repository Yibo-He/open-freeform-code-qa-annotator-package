Coverting all the list elements to string using Python?

I have a list:
```
roll = [1, 2, 3]
```

For converting each of the element into a string, can we directly do `roll = str(roll)` rather that iterating over it and calling `str()` on each element? Is this a correct way?
I am new to Python, any hint in the right direction will do!
