pip always fails ssl verification

Pip always fails ssl even when I do `pip install dedupe` or `pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org dedupe`

The output is always the same no matter what:

> Collecting dedupeRetrying (Retry(total=4, connect=None, read=None,
  redirect=None, status=None)) after connection broken by
  'SSLError(SSLError(1, '[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate
  verify failed (_ssl.c:777)'),)': /simple/dedupe/
  Retrying...skippingCould not find a version that satisfies the requirement dedupe (from versions: ) No matching distribution found for dedupe

So I uninstalled anaconda and reinstalled it. Same thing.

Do you think the problem is that my _ssl.c file (which I have no idea where it is) must be corrupt or something? Why would pip need to reference that if I'm telling it to bypass ssl verification anyway?
