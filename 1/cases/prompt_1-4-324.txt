How to split a comma and colon separated column into respective columns in R?

Say for example I have a column that looks something like:
```
name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC
```

How could I split this column into separate columns such that it would yield a result similar as a data frame to:
```
name   | Age | City
1 Michael | 31  | NYC
```

I've attempted to use mtabulate from the qdapTools package but it only resulted with boolean value columns.
