Run two nested for loops in parallel to create matrix

I've written a method that takes in an integer "n" and creates a square matrix where the values of each element are dictated by their respective i,j indices.
When I build a small matrix 30x30 it works just fine, but when I try to do something larger like 1000x1000 it takes very long. Is there any way that I can speed it up with multiprocessing?
```
def createMatrix(n):
    matrix = []
    for j in range(1,n+1):
        row = []
        for i in range(1,n+1):
            value = 1/(i+j-1)
            row.append(value)
        matrix.append(row)
    return np.array(matrix)
```
