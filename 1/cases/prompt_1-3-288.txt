How to increment index in Python loop

I am wanting to loop through a string and capture 2 items each time while also incrementing through the index of the iterable. So I want to slice 2 items but increase the index by 1 every time through the loop. How can I do this?
my_string = 'teststring'
desired output =
te
es
st
ts
st
tr
ri
in
ng
I have tried the following to slice the two items, but can't figure out the best way to iterate thought the index
```
str1 = 'teststring'
i=0
while i<10: 
    i +=1
    str2=str1[0:2]
    print(str2)
```
