I am trying to build a wordle solver as a self project however I got stuck in a small part of my code. The method that checks for each letter in both the choice word and the guess work and color codes them is working perfectly unless there is a word with a duplicate letter (eg: the word SHARE would work correctly however the word GUESS would only color code GUES). I tried using counter but how exactly would I exactly input the letter at the right place in the list?
```
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = dict()
    choiceword = []
    guesslist = []
    guessdict = dict()
    choicedict = dict()
    for a in choice:
        choiceword.append(a)
    for b in guess:
        guesslist.append(b)

    for idx, value in enumerate(choiceword):
        choicedict[idx] = value

    for idx, value in enumerate(guesslist):
        guessdict[idx] = value

    guesscolor[0] = guesslist[0]
    guesscolor[1] = guesslist[1]
    guesscolor[2] = guesslist[2]
    guesscolor[3] = guesslist[3]
    guesscolor[4] = guesslist[4]

    counter = 0

    lengthofword = len(guesslist)

    totalsame = 0

    sameword = 0

    countsguess = Counter(guessh)
    duplicatesguess = [c for c in countsguess if countsguess[c] > 1]
    countschoice = Counter(choice)
    duplicateschoices = [c for c in countschoice if countschoice[c] > 1]

    for a in duplicateschoices:
        if a == None:
            duplicateschoices.append("None")
    for a in duplicatesguess:
        if a == None:
            duplicatesguess.append("None")

    while (counter < lengthofword):
        if guessdict[counter] in choicedict.values():

            totalsame += 1

            if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
                print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
                sameword += 1
                a = guessdict[counter]
                guesscolor[a] = "green"



            else:
                a = guessdict[counter]
                guesscolor[a] = "orange"
            counter += 1


        else:
            a = guessdict[counter]
            guesscolor[a] = "red"
            counter += 1

    print(guesscolor)

    print("There are " + str(totalsame) + " duplicate characters." + str(sameword) + " of them are in the same place")


Game(0).wordcolor(choice, guessh)
```

Example output:
```
Computer choice word: eject 
Human Guess: ejjet (I haven't made the code to check guesses against dictionary) 
The word at index 0 is present in both strings in same place
The word at index 1 is present in both strings in same place
The word at index 4 is present in both strings in same place
{0: 'e', 1: 'j', 2: 'j', 3: 'e', 4: 't', 'e': 'orange', 'j': 'orange', 't': 'green'} (Ignores duplicate letters) 
There are 5 duplicate characters. 3 of them are in the same place
Incorrect Guess
```


```
Computer choice word: rotas 
Human Guess: share  
0: 's', 1: 'h', 2: 'a', 3: 'r', 4: 'e', 's': 'orange', 'h': 'red', 'a': 'orange', 'r': 'orange', 'e': 'red'}
There are 3 duplicate characters.0 of them are in the same place
Incorrect Guess
```

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that you're using the letters as keys in your `guesscolor` dictionary. When a letter is repeated, the previous value is overwritten, which is why you're not seeing all the letters color-coded correctly.

Instead of using the letters as keys, you should use the indices. This way, each position in the word will have its own entry in the dictionary, and no information will be lost when a letter is repeated.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = dict()
    choiceword = list(choice)
    guesslist = list(guess)

    counter = 0
    lengthofword = len(guesslist)
    totalsame = 0
    sameword = 0

    countsguess = Counter(guesslist)
    duplicatesguess = [c for c in countsguess if countsguess[c] > 1]
    countschoice = Counter(choiceword)
    duplicateschoices = [c for c in countschoice if countschoice[c] > 1]

    for a in duplicateschoices:
        if a == None:
            duplicateschoices.append("None")
    for a in duplicatesguess:
        if a == None:
            duplicatesguess.append("None")

    while (counter < lengthofword):
        if guesslist[counter] in choiceword:

            totalsame += 1

            if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
                print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
                sameword += 1
                guesscolor[counter] = "green"
            else:
                guesscolor[counter] = "orange"
            counter += 1
        else:
            guesscolor[counter] = "red"
            counter += 1

    print(guesscolor)

    print("There are " + str(totalsame) + " duplicate characters." + str(sameword) + " of them are in the same place")


Game(0).wordcolor(choice, guessh)
```

This code will create a dictionary where each key is an index of the word, and the value is the color that should be assigned to the letter at that index. This way, even if a letter is repeated, each occurrence will have its own entry in the dictionary.

The problem you're facing is due to the fact that you're using a dictionary to store the color of each letter. In Python, dictionaries can't have duplicate keys, so when you have a word with duplicate letters, the color of the last occurrence of that letter is the one that gets stored in the dictionary.

To solve this issue, you should use a list to store the color of each letter instead of a dictionary. This way, you can handle words with duplicate letters correctly. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    choiceword = list(choice)
    guesslist = list(guess)

    guesscolor = [''] * len(guesslist)  # Initialize the color list with empty strings

    counter = 0
    totalsame = 0
    sameword = 0

    while (counter < len(guesslist)):
        if guesslist[counter] in choiceword:
            totalsame += 1

            if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
                print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
                sameword += 1
                guesscolor[counter] = "green"
            else:
                guesscolor[counter] = "orange"
            counter += 1
        else:
            guesscolor[counter] = "red"
            counter += 1

    print(guesscolor)
    print("There are " + str(totalsame) + " duplicate characters." + str(sameword) + " of them are in the same place")

Game(0).wordcolor(choice, guessh)
```

In this modified version of your code, `guesscolor` is a list that stores the color of each letter in the guessed word. The color of the letter at index `i` in the guessed word is stored at index `i` in `guesscolor`. This way, you can handle words with duplicate letters correctly.

The issue you're facing is due to the way you're storing the color codes in your `guesscolor` dictionary. You're using the letter itself as the key, which means that if a letter appears more than once, it will overwrite the previous color. 

To fix this, you should use the index of the letter as the key in your `guesscolor` dictionary, not the letter itself. This way, each letter (even if it's the same) will have its own unique key, and you won't overwrite the color of a previous letter.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
while (counter < lengthofword):
    if guessdict[counter] in choicedict.values():

        totalsame += 1

        if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
            print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
            sameword += 1
            guesscolor[counter] = "green"  # use counter as key

        else:
            guesscolor[counter] = "orange"  # use counter as key
        counter += 1

    else:
        guesscolor[counter] = "red"  # use counter as key
        counter += 1
```

This way, each letter in your guess will have its own color, even if the letter is the same as another letter in the guess.
