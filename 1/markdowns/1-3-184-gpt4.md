I am completely new to `openpyxl` so, as you can imagine, I am having pretty hard times when I try to make use of it.
I have an Excel report that contains only one sheet (called `Sheet1)`. I'd like to search all cells for those that contain specific string (product name ABC in this case).
Then I would like to copy contents of every cell in the rows that contain cell with `ABC` product name. And assign every cell to a variable.
To give you better idea of what I am trying to achieve I'll give you an example:

So in this case I would only copy cells from rows: 2, 4, 6 (as only they contain `ABC` product).
I have already looked up similar questions and answers to them but I don't understand them (never have used Excel before).

Here's a simple way to do it using `openpyxl`. This script will open your workbook, go through each row in `Sheet1`, and if it finds the string 'ABC' in any cell in that row, it will store the entire row's values in a list.

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
wb = load_workbook('your_file.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
sheet = wb['Sheet1']

# This list will hold all rows that contain 'ABC'
rows_with_abc = []

# Go through each row
for row in sheet.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    # If 'ABC' is in the row, add it to the list
    if 'ABC' in row:
        rows_with_abc.append(row)

# Now rows_with_abc contains all rows with 'ABC'
for row in rows_with_abc:
    print(row)
```

In this script, replace `'your_file.xlsx'` with the path to your Excel file. The `iter_rows` method returns a generator that iterates over the rows in the sheet. The `values_only=True` argument makes it return only the cell values, not the cell objects themselves.

The `if 'ABC' in row:` line checks if the string 'ABC' is in any cell in the row. If it is, it adds the entire row (which is a tuple of cell values) to the `rows_with_abc` list.

After running this script, `rows_with_abc` will be a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row from the sheet, and only rows that contain 'ABC' will be included.

If you want to assign each cell to a variable, you can do so by unpacking the tuples. However, this would only be practical if you know the number of columns in the sheet. For example, if there are three columns, you could do:

```python
for row in rows_with_abc:
    cell1, cell2, cell3 = row
    print(cell1, cell2, cell3)
```

This will assign the value of each cell in the row to a separate variable.

Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this using `openpyxl`. 

Firstly, you need to install the `openpyxl` module. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to read your excel file and search for the specific string:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
wb = load_workbook(filename='your_file.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
ws = wb['Sheet1']

# The string you are looking for
search_string = 'ABC'

# List to hold rows with the search string
rows_with_search_string = []

# Iterate over the rows
for row in ws.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    # If the search string is in the row
    if search_string in row:
        # Add the row to the list
        rows_with_search_string.append(row)

# Now rows_with_search_string holds all rows with 'ABC'
# You can access individual cells in a row like this:
for row in rows_with_search_string:
    for cell in row:
        print(cell)
```

In this code, `rows_with_search_string` is a list of tuples, where each tuple represents a row in the Excel sheet. Each element in the tuple is a cell in that row. You can access the value of each cell by iterating over the rows and cells as shown in the last part of the code.

Remember to replace `'your_file.xlsx'` with the path to your Excel file.

Here's a simple example of how you can achieve this using `openpyxl`. 

First, you need to install the `openpyxl` module. If you haven't done so, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to read the Excel file, search for the specific string in all cells, and store the contents of the rows containing the string in a list of dictionaries:

```python
from openpyxl import load_workbook

# Load the workbook
wb = load_workbook('your_file.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
ws = wb['Sheet1']

# The string to search for
search_string = 'ABC'

# List to store the rows
rows = []

# Iterate over the rows
for row in ws.iter_rows(values_only=True):
    # If the search string is in the row
    if search_string in row:
        # Create a dictionary with the column names as keys
        row_dict = {ws.cell(row=1, column=i+1).value: value for i, value in enumerate(row)}
        # Add the dictionary to the list
        rows.append(row_dict)

# Now you have all the rows containing the search string in the 'rows' list
for row in rows:
    print(row)
```

This will print all the rows containing 'ABC' as dictionaries, with the column names as keys. You can then use these dictionaries to access the cell values.

Please replace `'your_file.xlsx'` with the path to your Excel file.

This code assumes that the first row of the sheet contains the column names. If that's not the case, you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.
