I am trying to process images and I would like to brighten the dark areas of my image. I tried Histogram Equalization, however as there are also some bright areas in the image, the result is not satisfying. This is why I am looking for a way to brighten  of the image.
As an example, Input image is on the left and the expected result is on the right, the hair and face of the girl are brightened

ImageMagick seems to offer some possibilities to achieve this, however, I would like to do it using python

You can use Python's OpenCV and NumPy libraries to achieve this. Here's a simple way to brighten the dark areas of an image:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 1)

# Convert the image to YUV color space
img_yuv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2YUV)

# Apply histogram equalization on the Y channel
img_yuv[:,:,0] = cv2.equalizeHist(img_yuv[:,:,0])

# Convert the image back to RGB color space
img_output = cv2.cvtColor(img_yuv, cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Color input image', img)
cv2.imshow('Histogram equalized', img_output)

cv2.waitKey(0)
```

This code will brighten the dark areas of the image by applying histogram equalization on the Y channel (luminance) of the image in YUV color space. However, this might still brighten some of the already bright areas.

To have more control over which areas of the image to brighten, you can use adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) instead of regular histogram equalization. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('image.jpg', 1)

# Convert the image to YUV color space
img_yuv = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2YUV)

# Apply CLAHE to Y channel
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
img_yuv[:,:,0] = clahe.apply(img_yuv[:,:,0])

# Convert the image back to RGB color space
img_output = cv2.cvtColor(img_yuv, cv2.COLOR_YUV2BGR)

# Display the image
cv2.imshow('Color input image', img)
cv2.imshow('Histogram equalized', img_output)

cv2.waitKey(0)
```

This code will apply adaptive histogram equalization to the Y channel of the image, which will brighten the dark areas of the image while preserving the brightness of the already bright areas. You can adjust the `clipLimit` and `tileGridSize` parameters of the `createCLAHE` function to control the amount of brightening and the size of the areas to brighten, respectively.

You can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) and NumPy to achieve this. Here is a simple example of how you can brighten an image:

```python
from PIL import Image
import numpy as np

# Open the image file
img = Image.open('input.jpg').convert('RGB')

# Convert the image data to an array
data = np.array(img)

# Apply a scaling factor to the red, green, and blue channels
# This will brighten the image
factor = 1.5
data = data * factor

# The previous operation could have set values over 255
# Clip values to 255
data = np.clip(data, 0, 255)

# Convert the data back to an image
img = Image.fromarray(data.astype('uint8'))

# Save the new image
img.save('output.jpg')
```

This will brighten the entire image. If you want to brighten only the dark areas, you could apply a condition to the data array to only modify those pixels:

```python
# Only brighten pixels that are below a certain value
mask = data < 128
data[mask] = data[mask] * factor
```

This will brighten only the dark areas of the image. You can adjust the threshold and the scaling factor to get the result you want.

If you want to apply more complex transformations to the image, you might want to look into using OpenCV, which provides a lot of powerful image processing functions.

You can use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to achieve this. The `ImageEnhance` module contains a number of classes that can be used for image enhancement:

- `Color` enhances or reduces the color in an image.
- `Contrast` enhances or reduces the contrast in an image.
- `Brightness` enhances or reduces the brightness in an image.
- `Sharpness` enhances or reduces the sharpness in an image.

Here is an example of how you can use the `Brightness` class to brighten an image:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageEnhance

# Open an image file
with Image.open('input.jpg') as img:
    # Create a Brightness enhancer
    enhancer = ImageEnhance.Brightness(img)
    
    # Increase the brightness by a factor of 2
    brighter_image = enhancer.enhance(2)
    
    # Save the brightened image
    brighter_image.save('output.jpg')
```

In this example, the `enhance` method is used to brighten the image. The argument to this method is a factor that specifies how much to enhance the brightness. A factor of 1.0 gives the original image. A factor of 2.0 gives a brightened image.

However, this method brightens the whole image, not just the dark areas. If you want to brighten only the dark areas, you might need to use a more advanced technique, such as adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE - Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization), which is available in the OpenCV library. Here is an example:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('input.jpg', 0)

# Create a CLAHE object (Arguments are optional)
clahe = cv2.createCLAHE(clipLimit=2.0, tileGridSize=(8,8))
cl1 = clahe.apply(img)

cv2.imwrite('output.jpg',cl1)
```

In this example, the `createCLAHE` function is used to create a CLAHE object. The `clipLimit` parameter is used to limit the contrast of the image. The `tileGridSize` parameter is used to specify the size of the grid for the histogram equalization. The `apply` method is then used to apply the CLAHE to the image.
