I've been getting this error on several programs for now.
I've tried upgrading pytube, reinstalling it, tried some fixes, changed URLs and code, but nothing seems to work.
```
from pytube import YouTube

#ask for the link from user
link = input("Enter the link of YouTube video you want to download:  ")
yt = YouTube(link)

#Showing details
print("Title: ",yt.title)
print("Number of views: ",yt.views)
print("Length of video: ",yt.length)
print("Rating of video: ",yt.rating)
#Getting the highest resolution possible
ys = yt.streams.get_highest_resolution()

#Starting download
print("Downloading...")
ys.download()
print("Download completed!!")
```

and this is the error code:
