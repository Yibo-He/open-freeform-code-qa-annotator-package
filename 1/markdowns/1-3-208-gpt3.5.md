I am importing string and trying to check if text contains only "a-z", "A-Z", and "0-9".

But I get only input and it doesn't print success when I enter letters and digits

```
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if text in correct:
    print("Success")
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want to do. Instead, you need to check if every character in the input string is present in the `correct` string.

You can do this using a loop and the `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are true, and `False` otherwise. Here's an updated version of your code that should work:

```
import string
text = input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if all(char in correct for char in text):
    print("Success")
```

This code loops through every character in the input string `text`, and checks if it is present in the `correct` string using the `in` operator. The `all()` function then checks if all of these checks are true, and if so, prints "Success".

The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want to do. Instead, you should check if every character in the input string is present in the `correct` string. You can do this using a loop and the `all()` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```
import string
text = input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if all(char in correct for char in text):
    print("Success")
```

This code loops through every character in the input string and checks if it is present in the `correct` string. The `all()` function returns `True` if all the characters are present in `correct`, and `False` otherwise.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is present in the `correct` string, which is not what you want to do. Instead, you should check if each character in the input string is present in the `correct` string. Here's a modified version of your code that should work:

```
import string
text = input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
success = True
for char in text:
    if char not in correct:
        success = False
        break
if success:
    print("Success")
```

This code loops through each character in the input string and checks if it is present in the `correct` string. If any character is not present, the `success` variable is set to `False` and the loop is broken. If all characters are present, `success` remains `True` and the "Success" message is printed.
