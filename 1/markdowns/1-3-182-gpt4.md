I am using the new [multipage feature](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/multipage-apps) and would like to style my multipage app and put a logo with a title on top of/before the page navigation.
Here's a small example tested on `Python 3.9` with `streamlit==1.11.1` in the following directory structure:
```
/Home.py
/pages/Page_1.py
/pages/Page_2.py
```

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st


st.sidebar.markdown(
    "My Logo (sidebar) should be on top of the Navigation within the sidebar"
)

st.markdown("# Home")
```

`Page_1.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 2")
```

which I can run using:
```
$ streamlit run Home.py
```

But this leads to the Text printed  and not  the navigation:

Is there any way to do this? Any hints are welcome!
Best wishes,

You can achieve this by creating a main app that will handle the navigation and the display of the logo and title. Here's an example of how you can do it:

First, create a new Python file, let's call it `main.py`. This file will be responsible for displaying the logo, title, and handling the navigation between different pages of your app.

`main.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

PAGES = {
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2
}

def main():
    st.sidebar.title('My Logo')
    selection = st.sidebar.radio("Go to", list(PAGES.keys()))
    page = PAGES[selection]
    page.app()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Then, modify your `Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py` files to have an `app` function that will be called when the page is selected:

`Page_1.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 2")
```

Now, you can run your app using:
```
$ streamlit run main.py
```

This will display your logo and title at the top of the sidebar, and below it, you will have a radio button selection for navigation between your pages. When you select a page, the corresponding `app` function will be called, displaying the content of the selected page.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the `st.sidebar` function to create a sidebar in your Streamlit app. This sidebar can contain any Streamlit command. In your case, you can use it to display a logo and a title before the page navigation.

Here's how you can modify your `Home.py` to achieve this:

```python
import streamlit as st
from PIL import Image

# Load the logo image (ensure the logo is in the same directory as your script)
logo = Image.open("logo.png")

# Display the logo using st.sidebar.image
st.sidebar.image(logo, use_column_width=True)

# Display the title using st.sidebar.header or st.sidebar.title
st.sidebar.title("My App Title")

# Create a selectbox for navigation
page = st.sidebar.selectbox("Choose a page", ["Home", "Page 1", "Page 2"])

if page == "Home":
    st.markdown("# Home")
elif page == "Page 1":
    st.markdown("Page 1")
elif page == "Page 2":
    st.markdown("Page 2")
```

In this example, the logo and title are displayed at the top of the sidebar, before the page navigation selectbox. The `use_column_width=True` argument makes the logo use the full width of the sidebar.

Please note that you need to have the `PIL` (Pillow) library installed to use `Image.open`. You can install it with `pip install pillow`.

Also, make sure to replace `"logo.png"` with the path to your actual logo file. If the logo file is not in the same directory as your script, you need to provide the full path to the image file.

As for the multipage feature, you might need to adjust your directory structure and import the pages as modules in your main script. Here's an example of how you can structure your project:

```
/my_app
    /pages
        __init__.py
        page_1.py
        page_2.py
    main.py
    logo.png
```

In this structure, `main.py` is your main script that you run with `streamlit run main.py`. The `pages` directory contains the scripts for the individual pages of your app, and `logo.png` is your logo image. The `__init__.py` file is an empty file that allows Python to recognize the `pages` directory as a package from which you can import modules.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can add a logo and a title on top of the page navigation in your Streamlit app. You can use the `st.sidebar.image` function to display the logo and `st.sidebar.title` or `st.sidebar.header` to display the title. Here's an example:

```python
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

PAGES = {
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2
}

st.sidebar.image("logo.png")  # Add your logo here
st.sidebar.title("My App")  # Add your title here

selection = st.sidebar.radio("Go to", list(PAGES.keys()))
page = PAGES[selection]

page.app()
```

In this example, replace `"logo.png"` with the path to your logo image. The `st.sidebar.image` function will display the logo in the sidebar. The `st.sidebar.title` function will display the title below the logo. The `st.sidebar.radio` function will display the page navigation below the title.

The `Page_1` and `Page_2` modules should have an `app` function that contains the code for the page. For example, `Page_1.py` could look like this:

```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 1")
```

And `Page_2.py` could look like this:

```python
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("Page 2")
```

When you run your `Home.py` script, Streamlit will display the logo and the title in the sidebar, and the page navigation below them. When you select a page in the navigation, Streamlit will run the `app` function from the corresponding module and display the page.
