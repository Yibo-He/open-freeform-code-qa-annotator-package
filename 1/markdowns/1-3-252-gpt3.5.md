I have a DataFrame with columns A, B, and C. For each value of A, I would like to select the row with the minimum value in column B.
That is, from this:
```
df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2],
                   'B': [4, 5, 2, 7, 4, 6],
                   'C': [3, 4, 10, 2, 4, 6]})      
    A   B   C
0   1   4   3
1   1   5   4
2   1   2   10
3   2   7   2
4   2   4   4
5   2   6   6
```

I would like to get:
```
A   B   C
0   1   2   10
1   2   4   4
```

For the moment I am grouping by column A, then creating a value that indicates to me the rows I will keep:
```
a = data.groupby('A').min()
a['A'] = a.index
to_keep = [str(x[0]) + str(x[1]) for x in a[['A', 'B']].values]
data['id'] = data['A'].astype(str) + data['B'].astype('str')
data[data['id'].isin(to_keep)]
```

I am sure that there is a much more straightforward way to do this.
I have seen many answers here that use MultiIndex, which I would prefer to avoid.
Thank you for your help.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can use `groupby` and `idxmin` to get the index of the minimum value in column B for each group of A, and then use `loc` to select those rows:
```
min_idx = df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()
result = df.loc[min_idx]
```
This will give you the desired output:
```
A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use `groupby` and `idxmin` to get the index of the minimum value in column B for each group of A, and then use `loc` to select the corresponding rows:
```
df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```
Output:
```
A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by using `groupby` on column A and then applying `idxmin` on column B to get the index of the row with the minimum value in column B for each group. Finally, you can use `loc` to select the rows with those indices:
```
df.loc[df.groupby('A')['B'].idxmin()]
```
This will give you the desired output:
```
A  B   C
2  1  2  10
4  2  4   4
```
