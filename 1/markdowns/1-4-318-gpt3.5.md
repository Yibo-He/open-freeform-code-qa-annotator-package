I have a folder on my Windows desktop (`C:\Users\me\Desktop\Fonts`) which contains fonts that I would like to import into R using `extrafont`.

When I try to import the fonts using

```
library(extrafont)
font_import(paths = "C:/Users/me/Desktop/Fonts", prompt=FALSE)
```


I receive the error message

```

```


Based on this I have two questions:


1. How can I overcome the No FontName. Skipping. issue?
2. What are the warning messages trying to tell me and do I need to be concerned about this?



I would appreciate any help, many thanks in advance!

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The "No FontName. Skipping." issue occurs when the font file does not contain a FontName property. This property is required for the font to be imported into R using `extrafont`. 

To overcome this issue, you can try renaming the font files to include the FontName property. For example, you can rename "arista-light.ttf" to "Arista-Light-Regular.ttf". This should allow `extrafont` to recognize the font and import it successfully.

Regarding the warning messages, they indicate that the `ttf2pt1` utility, which is used by `extrafont` to extract font metrics, encountered an error while processing the font files. This could be due to various reasons such as invalid font files or issues with the `ttf2pt1` installation.

You can try reinstalling `extrafont` and its dependencies, or manually installing `ttf2pt1` and ensuring that it is in your system's PATH. Alternatively, you can try using a different font import method such as `font_import()` from the `showtext` package.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message "No FontName. Skipping." indicates that the font files in the specified folder do not contain the necessary metadata for `extrafont` to recognize them as valid font files. This can happen if the font files are corrupted or incomplete.

To resolve this issue, you can try downloading the font files again from a reliable source and placing them in the specified folder. Alternatively, you can try using a different font file format, such as OpenType (.otf) or PostScript (.ps), which may be more compatible with `extrafont`.

The warning messages indicate that there were issues with running the `ttf2pt1` utility, which is used by `extrafont` to extract font metrics from TrueType (.ttf) font files. These issues may be related to the font files themselves or to the configuration of your system.

While these warning messages may not necessarily indicate a critical problem, they may affect the accuracy of the font metrics extracted by `extrafont`. To minimize the impact of these issues, you can try updating your system and ensuring that all necessary dependencies are installed. You can also try using a different font file format or a different font import method, such as `font_import_from_pdf()` or `font_import_from_glyph()`.

If you continue to experience issues with importing fonts into R using `extrafont`, you may want to consult the package documentation or seek assistance from the R community.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The "No FontName. Skipping." issue occurs when the font file does not contain the necessary metadata for `extrafont` to import it. Unfortunately, there is no easy fix for this issue, as it requires modifying the font file itself to include the necessary metadata.

Regarding the warning messages, they are related to the `ttf2pt1` utility that `extrafont` uses to extract font metrics from the font files. The warnings indicate that the utility encountered an error while processing the font files. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as a corrupted font file or an issue with the `ttf2pt1` utility itself.

While these warning messages are not ideal, they do not necessarily indicate a critical issue with your system or the font files themselves. However, if you are experiencing issues with the imported fonts, it may be worth investigating these warnings further.

In summary, the "No FontName. Skipping." issue cannot be easily resolved, and the warning messages may or may not be cause for concern.
