I'm running on this issue for quite a while now.

I set the writer as follows:

```
writer = pd.ExcelWriter(arquivo+'.xlsx', engine = 'xlsxwriter', options = {'remove_timezone': True})
df.to_excel(writer, header = True, index = True)
```


This code is inside s function. The problem is every time I run the code, it gets information from the database, which contains two columns datetime64[ns, UTC] object with time zone info. But when the code to save to Excel runs I receive:

```
ValueError: Excel does not support datetimes with timezones. Please ensure that datetimes are timezone unaware before writing to Excel.
```


I have already tried several things like 'dt.tz_convert', replace(tzinfo=None) and other solutions I have found here and around.

The code runs without problem in my personal computer, my colleague at work with the same machine specs can run the code. Only in my machine it doesn't. I already reinstalled python and all the packages, including formatting the machine and nothing, the error persists.

xlrd v1.1.0

xlsxwriter v1.0.4

python 3.7.4

pandas v0.25.1

If someone could bring some light into this issue I would much appreciate it.

Thanks

The error message you're seeing is because Excel does not support timezone-aware datetimes. You need to convert your timezone-aware datetime objects to timezone-naive datetime objects before writing to Excel.

You mentioned that you've tried using `dt.tz_convert` and `replace(tzinfo=None)`, but it's not clear how you've used them. Here's how you can use them to remove the timezone information from your datetime columns:

```python
# Convert timezone-aware datetime to timezone-naive datetime in UTC
df['datetime_column'] = df['datetime_column'].dt.tz_convert(None)
```

Replace `'datetime_column'` with the name of your datetime column. If you have multiple datetime columns, you'll need to do this for each one.

If this doesn't work, it might be worth checking the data types of your columns to make sure they're what you expect. You can do this with `df.dtypes`.

If the data types are correct and you're still seeing the error, it might be an issue with your pandas or xlsxwriter versions. You mentioned that the code works on your colleague's machine. If they're using different versions of pandas or xlsxwriter, you might try installing those versions to see if it resolves the issue.

The error message suggests that the datetime objects in your DataFrame have timezone information attached to them, which is not supported by Excel. 

You can try to remove the timezone information from your datetime columns before writing to Excel. Here is how you can do it:

```python
df['your_datetime_column'] = df['your_datetime_column'].dt.tz_localize(None)
```

Replace `'your_datetime_column'` with the actual name of your datetime column. If you have multiple datetime columns, you need to do this for each of them.

If you don't know which columns are datetime, you can use this code to remove timezone from all datetime columns:

```python
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
        df[col] = df[col].dt.tz_localize(None)
```

This will remove the timezone information from all datetime columns in your DataFrame. After this, you should be able to write your DataFrame to Excel without any issues.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is because the Excel file format does not support timezone-aware datetimes. 

You've mentioned that you've tried several methods to remove the timezone information from your datetime objects, but without seeing the exact code it's hard to say why they might not be working.

Here's a method that should work:

```python
df['your_datetime_column'] = df['your_datetime_column'].dt.tz_localize(None)
```

This will remove the timezone information from the datetime objects in the specified column of your DataFrame. You'll need to do this for each column that contains timezone-aware datetimes.

If you have multiple datetime columns, you can use a loop:

```python
for col in df.columns:
    if df[col].dtype == 'datetime64[ns, UTC]':
        df[col] = df[col].dt.tz_localize(None)
```

After running this code, you should be able to write your DataFrame to an Excel file without encountering the ValueError.

If the error persists, it might be due to differences in the versions of the packages you're using. You mentioned that the code runs without problems on your personal computer and your colleague's machine. If they're using different versions of pandas, xlsxwriter, or Python itself, that could explain the discrepancy. Try to make sure that the versions of these packages are the same across all machines.
