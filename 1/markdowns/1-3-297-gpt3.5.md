I've got a map variable that identifies existing s3 buckets:
```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  #other configuration
}

variable "s3_replication" {
  description = "Map of buckets to replicate"
  type        = map
  default = {
    logs = {
      source = "logs_bucket",
      destination = "central_logs_bucket"
    },
    security = {
      source = "cloudtrail_bucket",
      destination = "central_security_bucket"
    }
  }
}
```

Since these buckets already exist, I am trying to import them and then apply the a configuration to them to update the resources. Unfortunately, I am not able to figure out how to do a terraform import on these. I've tried:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[logs] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0].source logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[0[source]] logs_bucket
```

All failing with a different error. Any idea on how to import existing resources listed on a map?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To import existing resources listed on a map, you need to use the `for_each` meta-argument in your resource block. Here's an example of how you can import the existing S3 buckets using the `for_each` meta-argument:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  #other configuration
}
```

To import the existing S3 buckets, you can use the following command:

```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
```

This command will import the `logs_bucket` as the `logs` resource in the `aws_s3_bucket.bucket` resource block.

You can repeat this command for each of the S3 buckets that you want to import. Make sure to replace `logs_bucket` with the name of the existing S3 bucket that you want to import.

Once you have imported the S3 buckets, you can apply the configuration to update the resources.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To import existing resources listed on a map, you need to use the `for_each` meta-argument in your resource block. Here's an example of how you can import the existing S3 buckets:

```
resource "aws_s3_bucket" "bucket" {
  for_each = var.s3_replication
  bucket   = each.value.source
  # other configuration

  lifecycle {
    ignore_changes = [
      # Add any attributes that should be ignored during updates
    ]
  }
}
```

Then, you can run the following command to import the existing S3 buckets:

```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"] cloudtrail_bucket
```

Make sure to replace `logs_bucket` and `cloudtrail_bucket` with the actual names of your existing S3 buckets. Also, note that you need to use the keys from your `s3_replication` map to reference the resources in Terraform.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To import existing resources listed on a map, you can use the following command:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket[<key>] <bucket_name>
```
Where `<key>` is the key of the map and `<bucket_name>` is the name of the existing S3 bucket.

In your case, you can use the following commands to import the existing S3 buckets:
```
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["logs"] logs_bucket
terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket["security"] cloudtrail_bucket
```
Make sure to replace `cloudtrail_bucket` with the actual name of the security bucket.

After importing the resources, you can apply the configuration to update the resources.
