I just newly install python 3.8 via anaconda installer and install pytorch using command
```
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
```

when i try to import torch, I got this error message.
```
OSError: [WinError 126] The specified module could not be found. Error loading "C:\Users\chunc\anaconda3\lib\site-packages\torch\lib\asmjit.dll" or one of its dependencies.
```

I can see [dll files](https://i.stack.imgur.com/s92PY.png) are still in the directory.
I ran Dependency Walker and it gave me [this result](https://i.stack.imgur.com/nsnqp.png).
I am with this problem for a day.
What should i do if i want to use PyTorch module?

The error you're encountering is often due to one of the following reasons:

1. There might be a problem with the installation of PyTorch. You can try to uninstall and then reinstall PyTorch. 

2. There might be a conflict with the system PATH. Make sure that the path to the Python interpreter you're using is correctly set in your system's PATH variable.

3. There might be a conflict with other Python packages or versions. Make sure you're using a clean Python environment, and that there are no conflicts with other installed packages or Python versions.

Here are some steps you can follow to troubleshoot and solve your problem:

1. Create a new conda environment and install PyTorch in that environment. This can help isolate the problem and avoid conflicts with other packages or Python versions. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n new_env python=3.8
conda activate new_env
conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
```

2. If the problem persists, try installing a different version of PyTorch, or try installing it with pip instead of conda. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
pip install torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```

3. If none of the above solutions work, there might be a problem with your Python or Anaconda installation. In this case, you might want to consider reinstalling Python or Anaconda.

Remember to always activate your conda environment before running your Python code:

```bash
conda activate new_env
```

And then you can run Python and import torch:

```python
python
>>> import torch
```

The error you're encountering seems to be related to the PyTorch installation. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Uninstall and Reinstall PyTorch**: Sometimes, the installation might not have completed successfully, causing some files to be missing or corrupted. You can uninstall PyTorch using the command `conda uninstall pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch` and then reinstall it.

2. **Install a Specific Version of PyTorch**: Sometimes, the latest version of a package might have compatibility issues with your system or other packages. You can try installing a specific version of PyTorch that you know works well. For example, you can use the command `conda install pytorch=1.6.0 torchvision=0.7.0 cpuonly -c pytorch` to install version 1.6.0 of PyTorch and version 0.7.0 of torchvision.

3. **Update Anaconda and Conda**: It's possible that your Anaconda or Conda installation is outdated, causing compatibility issues. You can update Anaconda using the command `conda update anaconda` and Conda using the command `conda update conda`.

4. **Check for System Issues**: The error message mentions a DLL file, which is a type of file used by Windows. It's possible that there's an issue with your Windows installation. You can try updating Windows, reinstalling Anaconda, or even reinstalling Windows if necessary.

5. **Ask for Help**: If none of the above steps work, you can ask for help on the PyTorch forums or on Stack Overflow. Make sure to provide all the details about your problem, including the error message, what you've tried so far, and any other relevant information.

Remember to restart your system after making these changes to ensure they take effect.

The error you're encountering is related to a missing or incompatible DLL file. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Reinstall PyTorch**: Uninstall PyTorch and then reinstall it. Sometimes, the installation might not have completed successfully, causing some files to be missing or incompatible.

   To uninstall PyTorch, you can use the following command:
   ```
   conda uninstall pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```
   Then, reinstall it using the command you've provided.

2. **Update Anaconda and Conda**: Make sure that your Anaconda distribution and Conda package manager are up-to-date. You can update them using the following commands:
   ```
   conda update anaconda
   conda update conda
   ```
   After updating, try reinstalling PyTorch.

3. **Check your System Type**: Make sure you're installing the correct version of PyTorch for your system. If you're using a 64-bit version of Python, you should also be using a 64-bit version of PyTorch.

4. **Install with pip instead of conda**: Sometimes, installing PyTorch with pip instead of conda can solve the problem. You can try this with the following commands:
   ```
   pip uninstall torch torchvision
   pip install torch==1.8.1+cpu torchvision==0.9.1+cpu torchaudio===0.8.1 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```
   This will install PyTorch, torchvision, and torchaudio for a CPU-only version of PyTorch.

5. **Create a new Conda environment**: Sometimes, there might be conflicts with other packages in your current Conda environment. Creating a new environment can help avoid these conflicts. Here's how you can do it:
   ```
   conda create -n new_env python=3.8
   conda activate new_env
   conda install pytorch torchvision cpuonly -c pytorch
   ```
   This will create a new Conda environment with Python 3.8 and install PyTorch in this environment.

Remember to replace `new_env` with the name you want for your new environment.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a problem with your Python installation or your system. In this case, you might need to reinstall Python or check your system for issues.
