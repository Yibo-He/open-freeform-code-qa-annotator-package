I'm following [this tutorial](https://pythonprogramming.net/linear-svc-example-scikit-learn-svm-python) to make this ML prediction:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import style

style.use("ggplot")
from sklearn import svm

x = [1, 5, 1.5, 8, 1, 9]
y = [2, 8, 1.8, 8, 0.6, 11]

plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()

X = np.array([[1,2],
             [5,8],
             [1.5,1.8],
             [8,8],
             [1,0.6],
             [9,11]])

y = [0,1,0,1,0,1]
X.reshape(1, -1)

clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C = 1.0)
clf.fit(X,y)

print(clf.predict([0.58,0.76]))
```


I'm using Python 3.6 and I get error "Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead:"
I think the script is for older versions, but I don't know how to convert it to the 3.6 version.

Already try with the:

```
X.reshape(1, -1)
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error "Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead" is because the `predict` method expects a 2D array as input. You can reshape the input to a 2D array using the `reshape` method as you have tried, but you need to assign the result back to `X` for it to take effect:

```
X = X.reshape(-1, 2)
```

This will reshape `X` to a 2D array with 6 rows and 2 columns. Then you can fit the model and make predictions:

```
clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1.0)
clf.fit(X, y)

print(clf.predict([[0.58, 0.76]]))
```

Note that you need to pass the input to `predict` as a 2D array with one row and two columns.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message "Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead" is because the `predict()` method expects a 2D array as input, but you are passing a 1D array. To fix this, you can reshape the input array to have a shape of `(1, 2)` using the `reshape()` method. Here's the updated code:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import style
style.use("ggplot")
from sklearn import svm

x = [1, 5, 1.5, 8, 1, 9]
y = [2, 8, 1.8, 8, 0.6, 11]

plt.scatter(x,y)
plt.show()

X = np.array([[1,2],
             [5,8],
             [1.5,1.8],
             [8,8],
             [1,0.6],
             [9,11]])

y = [0,1,0,1,0,1]
X = X.reshape(-1, 2)

clf = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C = 1.0)
clf.fit(X,y)

print(clf.predict([[0.58,0.76]]))
```

Note that `X.reshape(-1, 2)` reshapes `X` to have 2 columns and an unknown number of rows, which is inferred from the size of `X`. This ensures that the input to `predict()` is a 2D array with shape `(1, 2)`.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message "Expected 2D array, got 1D array instead" is because the input to the `predict` method should be a 2D array. You can fix this by wrapping the input in double square brackets like this:

```
print(clf.predict([[0.58,0.76]]))
```

Also, the line `X.reshape(1, -1)` does not actually modify the `X` array. Instead, you can assign the result of the reshape operation to `X` like this:

```
X = X.reshape(1, -1)
```

However, this is not necessary for the code to work correctly.
