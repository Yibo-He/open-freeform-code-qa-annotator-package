I am using R 4.0.2.
I manually installed 2 packages from `cfcdae` and `Stats5303lib` from [here](http://users.stat.umn.edu/%7Egary/classes/5303/software.html). I followed the instruction [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) to download Rtools and use it to install packages above.
Problem is
```
writeLines('PATH="${RTOOLS40_HOME}\\usr\\bin;${PATH}"', con = "~/.Renviron") # runs fine
Sys.which("make") #works fine
                               make 
"C:\\rtools40\\usr\\bin\\make.exe" 
install.packages("Stat5303libs_0.7-5.zip",repos=NULL,type="source") # these all run fine
install.packages("cfcdae_0.8-4.zip",repos=NULL,type="source")  # these all run fine
```

However, when I ran into problem below when I tried to run the libraries.
```
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘cfcdae’:
 package ‘cfcdae’ was installed before R 4.0.0: please re-install it
```

I tried below but still in vain.
```
update.packages(ask=FALSE, checkBuilt=TRUE)
```

Why is this happening? Is it because the package is too old?

As requested, i have changed my `.libPaths()` as below and updated the `SessionInfo()` as well.
