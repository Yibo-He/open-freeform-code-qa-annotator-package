hi im working with dataset in pandas.
lets say the dataset having
ID,
TEST_TYPE,
TEST_STATUS,
TEST_DATE,
etc
i need to group a kind of column so first i try
```
data_useless[['TEST_TYPE', 'TEST_STATUS']].groupby('TEST_STATUS').count_values()
```

and it worked : showing the result of grouped data by test_status(FAILED TEST and PASS TEST) and count value of that data on dataset
now i want to know and see the data more from the PASS TEST
so i tried
```
data_useless.groupby(['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST')
```

and it not working.. showing error, it say 
i need to do something like
in sql :
```
SELECT *
FROM data_useless
WHERE TEST_STATUS = "PASS TEST"
group by TEST_STATUS;
```

please help,,,

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To filter the data by `TEST_STATUS` column where the value is 'PASS TEST', you can use the following code:

```
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will return a new dataframe with only the rows where `TEST_STATUS` is 'PASS TEST'.

If you want to group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and then filter only the rows where `TEST_STATUS` is 'PASS TEST', you can use the following code:

```
data_useless.groupby('TEST_STATUS').get_group('PASS TEST')
```

This will return a new dataframe with only the rows where `TEST_STATUS` is 'PASS TEST', grouped by `TEST_STATUS`.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To filter the data by 'PASS TEST' in pandas, you can use the following code:

```
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will filter the data and show only the rows where the TEST_STATUS column has the value 'PASS TEST'.

If you want to group the data by TEST_STATUS and then filter only the rows with 'PASS TEST', you can use the following code:

```
data_useless.groupby('TEST_STATUS').get_group('PASS TEST')
```

This will group the data by TEST_STATUS and then return only the rows where TEST_STATUS is 'PASS TEST'.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To filter the data by `TEST_STATUS` column where the value is "PASS TEST", you can use the following code:

```
data_useless[data_useless['TEST_STATUS'] == 'PASS TEST']
```

This will return a new DataFrame that only contains rows where the `TEST_STATUS` column has a value of "PASS TEST".

If you want to group the data by `TEST_STATUS` and count the number of occurrences of each value, you can use the following code:

```
data_useless.groupby('TEST_STATUS').size()
```

This will return a Series object that contains the count of each unique value in the `TEST_STATUS` column.
