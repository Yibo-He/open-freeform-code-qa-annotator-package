Got  my Django project on a Azure webapp, but when I call on SSH terminal:
> Python manage.py collectstatic
It says 252 files copied but my static files are not visible on my templates and static folder in wwwroot its empty...Here's my wwwroot structure:
```
wwwroot
|---Myproject
|---manage.py
|---oryx-manifest.toml
|---hostingstart.html
|---static //With all my static files
├── myapp
│   ├── migrations
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── static
|   |   |---Images
|   |   |   |--myimage.png
|   |   |   |--myimage2.png
│   └── templates
```

And this is my settings.py:
```
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
   ('myapp', os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'myapp', 'static')),
)
STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
  'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
)
```

Any idea why or what am I doing wrong ?, does Azure collect different ?
EDIT> When I go to my website my images don´t show...Im calling them like this on template:
```
{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'Images/myimage.png' %}" /><br>
```

EDIT 2 /////
In wwwroot creates indeed a folder with all my statics, but when I load my template they don´t show, in wen console I get this error for myimage.png and myimage2.png :
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```

It seems like the issue might be with your `STATIC_ROOT` setting. In your current configuration, `STATIC_ROOT` is set to `os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')`, which means that when you run `python manage.py collectstatic`, Django will copy all the static files to the `static/` directory in your project's root directory.

However, in your Azure web app, the static files are served from the `wwwroot/static` directory. To fix this, you should change your `STATIC_ROOT` setting to point to the `wwwroot/static` directory:

```
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, '..', 'wwwroot', 'static')
```

This will tell Django to copy all the static files to the `wwwroot/static` directory when you run `python manage.py collectstatic`.

Once you've made this change, try running `python manage.py collectstatic` again and see if the static files are now visible on your website.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like your static files are not being served correctly. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check if your static files are being collected correctly by running the `collectstatic` command again and verifying that the files are being copied to the correct location. You can also check the logs to see if there were any errors during the collection process.

2. Check if your static files are being served correctly by adding the following lines to your `urls.py` file:

```
from django.conf import settings
from django.conf.urls.static import static

urlpatterns = [
    # ... your URL patterns here ...
]

if settings.DEBUG:
    urlpatterns += static(settings.STATIC_URL, document_root=settings.STATIC_ROOT)
```

This will serve your static files from the `STATIC_ROOT` directory when `DEBUG` is set to `True`.

3. If you are using a production server, make sure that your server is configured to serve static files correctly. For example, if you are using Apache, you will need to configure the `Alias` and `Directory` directives to point to your static files directory.

4. Make sure that your static files are accessible from the URL specified in your `STATIC_URL` setting. For example, if your `STATIC_URL` is set to `/static/`, make sure that your static files are accessible at `http://yourdomain.com/static/`.

5. Check if your static files are being cached by your browser. Try clearing your browser cache or accessing your website in incognito mode.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the issue is with the STATIC_ROOT setting in your settings.py file. 

STATIC_ROOT is the directory where Django will collect all the static files from all the apps in your project. In your case, you have set it to BASE_DIR + 'static/', which means that Django will collect all the static files and put them in a folder named 'static' in the BASE_DIR directory.

However, in your wwwroot directory, there is already a folder named 'static' which contains all your static files. So, when you run the 'collectstatic' command, Django is copying all the static files to the BASE_DIR + 'static/' directory, but your templates are still looking for the static files in the 'static' directory in the wwwroot folder.

To fix this issue, you need to change the STATIC_ROOT setting to the path of the 'static' directory in the wwwroot folder. 

Try changing the STATIC_ROOT setting in your settings.py file to:

```
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles/')
```

Then, run the 'collectstatic' command again and check if the static files are now visible on your templates.
