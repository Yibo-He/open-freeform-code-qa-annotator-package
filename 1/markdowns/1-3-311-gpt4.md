I have a dataframe with 14 rows Ã— 1500 columns which contains only Numerical values. I want to apply a simple condition that if any values in the entire dataframe is above a certain number, say 25, then replace those values with 1 else replace with 0. I have found some solution on where I can perform such operation but I have specify the column name but I couldn't find any solution where I can perform one condition on the entire dataframe.
```
df[0.0] = df[0.0].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

This works for a specific column but
```
df = df[:,:].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

doesn't work. Could someone help?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

You can use the `applymap` function in pandas which applies a function to every single element of the dataframe. Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will replace all values in the dataframe with 1 if they are greater than or equal to 25, and with 0 otherwise.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the `applymap` function in pandas which applies a function to a DataFrame that is intended to operate elementwise, i.e. like doing map(func, series) for each series in the DataFrame.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

This will apply the function to each element in the dataframe, not just a specific column.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use the `applymap()` function in pandas to apply a function to every single element of the dataframe. Here is how you can do it:

```python
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will replace all values in your dataframe that are greater than or equal to 25 with 1, and all other values with 0.
