I'm currently working with the PyTorch framework and trying to understand foreign code. I got an indices issue and wanted to print the shape of a list.
The only way of doing so (as far as Google tells me) is to convert the list into a numpy array and then getting the shape with numpy.ndarray.shape().
But trying to convert my list into an array, I got a `ValueError: only one element tensors can be converted to Python scalars`.
My List is a converted PyTorch Tensor (`list(pytorchTensor)`) and looks somewhat like this:
```
[
tensor([[-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9855, -1.0069],  
        [-0.2781, -0.2567, -0.2353,  ..., -1.0069, -1.0283, -1.0927],  
        [-0.2567, -0.2567, -0.2138,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.1784],  
        ...,  
        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.6211,  ..., -1.0712, -1.1141, -1.0927],  
        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9426, -0.9640, -0.9640],  
        [-0.6640, -0.6425, -0.5997,  ..., -0.9640, -0.9426, -0.9426]]),

tensor([[-0.0769, -0.0980, -0.0769,  ..., -0.9388, -0.9598, -0.9808],  
        [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0980,  ..., -0.9598, -1.0018, -1.0228],    
        [-0.0559, -0.0769, -0.0769,  ..., -1.0228, -1.0439, -1.0859],  
        ...,  
        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -1.0018, -1.0439, -1.0228],  
        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.8757, -0.9177, -0.9177],  
        [-0.4973, -0.4973, -0.4973,  ..., -0.9177, -0.8967, -0.8967]]),

tensor([[-0.1313, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8328, -0.8753],  
        [-0.1313, -0.1525, -0.1313,  ..., -0.8541, -0.8966, -0.9391],  
        [-0.1100, -0.1313, -0.1100,  ..., -0.9391, -0.9816, -1.0666],  
        ...,  
        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8966, -0.8966, -0.8966],  
        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.8115, -0.7903],  
        [-0.4502, -0.4714, -0.4502,  ..., -0.8115, -0.7690, -0.7690]]),
]
```

Is there a way of getting the shape of that list without converting it into a numpy array?


----------
        
## GPT4 Attempt \#0

Yes, you can get the shape of the list without converting it into a numpy array. The shape of a list can be determined by using the built-in Python function `len()`. However, since your list contains PyTorch tensors, you can use the `size()` method to get the shape of each tensor.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```python
my_list = [tensor1, tensor2, tensor3]  # your list of tensors

# To get the shape of the entire list (i.e., the number of tensors in the list)
list_shape = len(my_list)
print("Shape of the list: ", list_shape)

# To get the shape of each tensor in the list
for i, tensor in enumerate(my_list):
    print(f"Shape of tensor {i}: ", tensor.size())
```

In your case, `tensor.size()` will return a tuple representing the shape of the tensor, similar to how `numpy.ndarray.shape` works.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Yes, you can get the shape of the list of tensors without converting it into a numpy array. 

Since your list is a list of PyTorch tensors, you can use the `size()` method of PyTorch tensor to get the shape of each tensor in the list. Here is how you can do it:

```python
for i, tensor in enumerate(your_list):
    print(f"Shape of tensor {i}: {tensor.size()}")
```

This will print the shape of each tensor in the list. If you want to get the total shape of the list, you can do something like this:

```python
total_shape = (len(your_list),) + your_list[0].size()
print(f"Total shape: {total_shape}")
```

This will give you a tuple where the first element is the length of the list (i.e., the number of tensors in the list), and the remaining elements are the shape of the tensors. Note that this assumes that all tensors in the list have the same shape. If the tensors can have different shapes, you will need to handle this differently.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can get the shape of the list without converting it into a numpy array. Each tensor in your list has a method called `size()` which returns the shape of the tensor. 

Here is how you can do it:

```python
# assuming your list of tensors is called tensor_list
shapes = [t.size() for t in tensor_list]

# print the shapes
for shape in shapes:
    print(shape)
```

This will print the shape of each tensor in your list. If you want to get the shape of the entire list (i.e., the number of tensors and the shape of each tensor), you can do something like this:

```python
# get the number of tensors and the shape of the first tensor
shape = (len(tensor_list),) + tuple(tensor_list[0].size())

print(shape)
```

This will give you a tuple where the first element is the number of tensors in the list and the remaining elements are the dimensions of each tensor. Note that this assumes that all tensors in the list have the same shape. If the tensors can have different shapes, you should stick with the first method.
