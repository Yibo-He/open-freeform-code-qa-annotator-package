Suppose I have a class that implements method chaining:
```
from __future__ import annotations

class M:
    def set_width(self, width: int)->M:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self, height: int)->M:
        self.height = height
        return self
```

I could use it like this:
```
box = M().set_width(5).set_height(10)
```

This works, but if I have a subclass M3D:
```
class M3D(M):
    def set_depth(self, depth: int) -> M3D:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

Now I can't do this:
```
cube = M3D().set_width(2).set_height(3).set_depth(5)
```

I get the following error in mypy:
```
_test_typeanotations.py:21: error: "M" has no attribute "set_depth"; maybe "set_width"
```

Because `set_width()` returns an `M` which has no method `set_depth`. I have seen suggestions to override `set_width()` and `set_height()` for every subclass to specify the correct types, but that would be a lot of code to write for each method. There has to be a easier way.
This is also relevant for special methods, for example `__enter__` traditionally returns `self`, so it would be nice to have a way to specify this without needing to even mention it in subclasses.

In Python, you can use the `Self` type hint to refer to the instance of the current class. This is useful when you want to type hint methods that return the instance of the current class, such as in method chaining or the builder pattern.

However, as of Python 3.10, the `Self` type hint is not officially supported. There is a proposal (PEP 673) to add it to the language, but it has not been accepted yet.

In the meantime, you can use a workaround with generics to achieve a similar effect. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TypeVar, Generic

T = TypeVar('T', bound='M')

class M(Generic[T]):
    def set_width(self, width: int) -> T:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self, height: int) -> T:
        self.height = height
        return self

class M3D(M['M3D']):
    def set_depth(self, depth: int) -> M3D:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

Now you can do this without any type errors:

```python
cube = M3D().set_width(2).set_height(3).set_depth(5)
```

This works because `M` is now a generic class that takes a type parameter `T`, which is used as the return type of `set_width` and `set_height`. When you subclass `M` with `M3D`, you specify that `T` is `M3D`, so `set_width` and `set_height` now return `M3D` in the context of the `M3D` class.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the `Self` type variable from the `typing` module to achieve this. The `Self` type variable is a special type variable that is implicitly bound to the type of the containing class. This means that using `Self` as a return type of a method will ensure that the method returns an instance of the current class:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import Self

class M:
    def set_width(self, width: int) -> Self:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self, height: int) -> Self:
        self.height = height
        return self

class M3D(M):
    def set_depth(self, depth: int) -> Self:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

Now, you can chain methods as you wanted:

```python
cube = M3D().set_width(2).set_height(3).set_depth(5)
```

This will not raise any mypy errors, because `set_width` and `set_height` are now correctly typed to return an instance of the current class (`M3D` in this case), which does have a `set_depth` method.

Please note that the `Self` type hint is available starting from Python 3.11. If you're using an older version of Python, you might not be able to use this feature.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use the `Self` type variable from the `typing` module to indicate that a method of a class returns an instance of that class. This is useful for methods or classes that are meant to be used with method chaining, where the return type of a method is the class instance itself.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```python
from __future__ import annotations
from typing import TypeVar

T = TypeVar('T', bound='M')

class M:
    def set_width(self: T, width: int) -> T:
        self.width = width
        return self

    def set_height(self: T, height: int) -> T:
        self.height = height
        return self

class M3D(M):
    def set_depth(self: T, depth: int) -> T:
        self.depth = depth
        return self
```

Now you can use method chaining as you intended:

```python
cube = M3D().set_width(2).set_height(3).set_depth(5)
```

This will not raise any mypy errors because the `set_width` and `set_height` methods are now correctly typed to return an instance of the subclass `M3D` when called on an instance of `M3D`.
