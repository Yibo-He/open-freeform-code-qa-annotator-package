I am trying to have a user interface using PyQt5 and pyqtgraph. I made two checkboxes and whenever I select them I want to plot one of the two data sets available in the code and whenever I deselect a button I want it to clear the corresponding curve. There are two checkboxes with texts `A1` and `A2` and each of them plot one set of data.
I have two issues:
1- If I select `A1` it plots the data associated with `A1` and as long as I do not select `A2`, by deselecting `A1` I can clear the data associated with `A1`.
However, If I check `A1` box and then I check `A2` box, then deselecting `A1` does not clear the associated plot. In this situation, if I choose to plot random data, instead of a deterministic curve such as `sin`, I see that by selecting either button new data is added but it cannot be removed.
2- The real application have 96 buttons each of which should be associated to one data set. I think the way I wrote the code is inefficient because I need to copy the same code for one button and data set 96 times. Is there a way to generalize the toy code I presented below to arbitrary number of checkboxes? Or perhaps, using/copying the almost the same code for every button is the usual and correct way to do this?
The code is:
```
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic, QtGui
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import SpanSelector
import numpy as np
import sys
import string
import pyqtgraph as pg
from pyqtgraph.Qt import QtGui, QtCore

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

x = np.linspace(0, 3.14, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)#Data number 1 associated to checkbox A1
y2 = np.cos(x)#Data number 2 associated to checkbox A2

#This function is called whenever the state of checkboxes changes
def todo():
    if cbx1.isChecked():
        global curve1
        curve1 = plot.plot(x, y1, pen = 'r')
    else:
        try:
            plot.removeItem(curve1)
        except NameError:
            pass
    if cbx2.isChecked():
        global curve2
        curve2 = plot.plot(x, y2, pen = 'y')
    else:
        try:
            plot.removeItem(curve2)
        except NameError:
            pass  
#A widget to hold all of my future widgets
widget_holder = QtGui.QWidget()

#Checkboxes named A1 and A2
cbx1 = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
cbx1.setText('A1')
cbx1.stateChanged.connect(todo)

cbx2 = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
cbx2.setText('A2')
cbx2.stateChanged.connect(todo)

#Making a pyqtgraph plot widget
plot = pg.PlotWidget()

#Setting the layout
layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()
widget_holder.setLayout(layout)

#Adding the widgets to the layout
layout.addWidget(cbx1, 0,0)
layout.addWidget(cbx2, 0, 1)
layout.addWidget(plot, 1,0, 3,1)

widget_holder.adjustSize()
widget_holder.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

To solve your issues, you can do the following:

1- The problem with your current implementation is that when you call `plot.plot()`, it adds a new plot item to the graph, but it doesn't remove the old one. To fix this, you should keep track of the plot items and remove them before adding a new one.

2- To handle multiple checkboxes, you can use a dictionary to map each checkbox to its corresponding data and plot item. This way, you don't need to copy the same code for each checkbox.

Here is the modified code:

```python
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, QtGui
import numpy as np
import sys
import pyqtgraph as pg

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

x = np.linspace(0, 3.14, 100)
data = {
    'A1': {'y': np.sin(x), 'plot': None, 'pen': 'r'},
    'A2': {'y': np.cos(x), 'plot': None, 'pen': 'y'},
    # Add more data here...
}

def todo():
    cbx = app.sender()
    key = cbx.text()
    if cbx.isChecked():
        if data[key]['plot'] is not None:
            plot.removeItem(data[key]['plot'])
        data[key]['plot'] = plot.plot(x, data[key]['y'], pen=data[key]['pen'])
    else:
        if data[key]['plot'] is not None:
            plot.removeItem(data[key]['plot'])
            data[key]['plot'] = None

widget_holder = QtGui.QWidget()

plot = pg.PlotWidget()

layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()
widget_holder.setLayout(layout)

for i, key in enumerate(data.keys()):
    cbx = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    cbx.setText(key)
    cbx.stateChanged.connect(todo)
    layout.addWidget(cbx, 0, i)

layout.addWidget(plot, 1, 0, 3, 1)

widget_holder.adjustSize()
widget_holder.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

In this code, `data` is a dictionary where each key is the text of a checkbox, and the value is another dictionary that contains the y-values of the data, the plot item (initialized as `None`), and the color of the plot. The `todo` function is modified to get the checkbox that emitted the signal using `app.sender()`, and then it uses the text of the checkbox to access the corresponding data and plot item.

Your code is almost correct. The issue is that you are trying to remove a curve that is not on the plot anymore. When you plot a new curve, the old one is automatically removed. Therefore, you should keep track of the curves that are currently on the plot and only try to remove those. 

For the second issue, you can create a dictionary that maps each checkbox to its corresponding curve and data. This way, you can use a loop to create the checkboxes and connect them to the `todo` function. 

Here is the modified code:

```python
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic, QtGui
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import SpanSelector
import numpy as np
import sys
import string
import pyqtgraph as pg
from pyqtgraph.Qt import QtGui, QtCore

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

x = np.linspace(0, 3.14, 100)
data = {'A1': np.sin(x), 'A2': np.cos(x)} # dictionary to hold the data
curves = {} # dictionary to hold the curves

#This function is called whenever the state of checkboxes changes
def todo():
    sender = app.sender() # get the checkbox that sent the signal
    if sender.isChecked():
        curves[sender.text()] = plot.plot(x, data[sender.text()], pen = 'r')
    else:
        plot.removeItem(curves[sender.text()])
        del curves[sender.text()]

#A widget to hold all of my future widgets
widget_holder = QtGui.QWidget()

#Making a pyqtgraph plot widget
plot = pg.PlotWidget()

#Setting the layout
layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()
widget_holder.setLayout(layout)

#Adding the widgets to the layout
for i, key in enumerate(data.keys()):
    cbx = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    cbx.setText(key)
    cbx.stateChanged.connect(todo)
    layout.addWidget(cbx, 0, i)

layout.addWidget(plot, 1,0, 3,1)

widget_holder.adjustSize()
widget_holder.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

In this code, `data` is a dictionary that maps each checkbox text to its corresponding data. `curves` is a dictionary that maps each checkbox text to its corresponding curve. When a checkbox is checked, a new curve is added to the plot and to the `curves` dictionary. When a checkbox is unchecked, the corresponding curve is removed from the plot and from the `curves` dictionary. 

This way, you can easily add more checkboxes and data by simply adding more entries to the `data` dictionary. The checkboxes and their connections are created in a loop, so you don't need to copy the same code for each checkbox.

Here is a solution to your problem:

1- The issue with the plot not being cleared when deselecting a checkbox is due to the fact that each time you call `plot.plot()`, it adds a new item to the plot. So, when you deselect a checkbox, it only removes the last curve added, not all of them. To fix this, you can store all the curves in a list and remove them all when deselecting a checkbox.

2- To avoid duplicating code for each checkbox, you can create a dictionary where the keys are the checkbox texts and the values are the corresponding data sets. Then, you can create the checkboxes in a loop and use a lambda function to pass the checkbox text to the `todo` function. This way, you can determine which data set to plot based on the checkbox text.

Here is the modified code:

```python
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, QtGui
import numpy as np
import sys
import pyqtgraph as pg

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

x = np.linspace(0, 3.14, 100)
data_sets = {'A1': np.sin(x), 'A2': np.cos(x)}  # Dictionary of data sets
curves = {}  # Dictionary to store the curves

# This function is called whenever the state of checkboxes changes
def todo(checkbox_text):
    if checkboxes[checkbox_text].isChecked():
        curves[checkbox_text] = plot.plot(x, data_sets[checkbox_text], pen='r' if checkbox_text == 'A1' else 'y')
    else:
        if checkbox_text in curves:
            plot.removeItem(curves[checkbox_text])
            del curves[checkbox_text]

# A widget to hold all of my future widgets
widget_holder = QtGui.QWidget()

# Making a pyqtgraph plot widget
plot = pg.PlotWidget()

# Setting the layout
layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()
widget_holder.setLayout(layout)

# Adding the widgets to the layout
checkboxes = {}
for i, checkbox_text in enumerate(data_sets.keys()):
    checkboxes[checkbox_text] = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    checkboxes[checkbox_text].setText(checkbox_text)
    checkboxes[checkbox_text].stateChanged.connect(lambda state, checkbox_text=checkbox_text: todo(checkbox_text))
    layout.addWidget(checkboxes[checkbox_text], 0, i)

layout.addWidget(plot, 1, 0, 3, 1)

widget_holder.adjustSize()
widget_holder.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

This code should work for any number of checkboxes and data sets. Just add more data sets to the `data_sets` dictionary and the corresponding checkboxes will be created automatically.
