I have a function that takes a link as input, then requests values, then puts them in an available list, this function doesn't return anything, how can I write test cases for them?
For example:
```
list = []
def myfunc(link):
    [code block]
    list.append(value)
```

To test this function, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a test case where you pass a valid link to the function and verify that the value is added to the list.
2. Create a test case where you pass an invalid link to the function and verify that the value is not added to the list.
3. Create a test case where you pass a link that returns an error and verify that the function handles the error correctly.
4. Create a test case where you pass a link that takes a long time to respond and verify that the function handles the delay correctly.

Here's an example of how you can write these test cases:

```
import unittest

class TestMyFunc(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_valid_link(self):
        link = "https://example.com"
        myfunc(link)
        self.assertIn(value, list)

    def test_invalid_link(self):
        link = "invalid_link"
        myfunc(link)
        self.assertNotIn(value, list)

    def test_error_link(self):
        link = "https://example.com/error"
        myfunc(link)
        # verify that the function handles the error correctly

    def test_slow_link(self):
        link = "https://example.com/slow"
        myfunc(link)
        # verify that the function handles the delay correctly

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

Note that you should replace the placeholders `[code block]`, `value`, and `list` with the actual code and variables used in your function.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To write test cases for this function, you can follow these steps:

1. Define a test case function that calls `myfunc` with a link and checks if the expected value is added to the list.

2. Create a list of links and expected values that you want to test.

3. Loop through the list of links and expected values, and call the test case function for each link.

Here's an example implementation:

```
def test_myfunc():
    link = "https://example.com"
    myfunc(link)
    assert "expected_value" in list

links_and_values = [
    ("https://example.com", "expected_value_1"),
    ("https://example.org", "expected_value_2"),
    ("https://example.net", "expected_value_3"),
]

for link, expected_value in links_and_values:
    test_myfunc(link, expected_value)
```

In this example, the `test_myfunc` function calls `myfunc` with a link and checks if the expected value is added to the list. The `links_and_values` list contains the links and expected values that we want to test. We loop through this list and call the `test_myfunc` function for each link. If the expected value is not added to the list, the test will fail.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To write test cases for a function that doesn't return anything, you can check if the function is modifying the list correctly. Here's an example of how you can write test cases for your function:

```
import unittest

class TestMyFunc(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.link = "https://example.com"
        self.expected_list = [1, 2, 3]

    def test_myfunc(self):
        myfunc(self.link)
        self.assertEqual(list, self.expected_list)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, we are creating a test case that sets up the link and the expected list. Then, we call the `myfunc` function with the link and check if the `list` variable has been modified correctly. If the `list` variable matches the `expected_list`, the test case passes. If not, the test case fails. You can add more test cases with different links and expected lists to ensure that the function is working correctly.
