I searched similar questions about reading csv from URL but I could not find a way to read csv file from google drive csv file.

My attempt:

```
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28/view?usp=sharing'
dfs = pd.read_html(url)
```


How can we read this file in pandas?

To read a CSV file from Google Drive in pandas, you need to get the shareable link of the file and modify it to get the direct download link. Here's how you can do it:

1. Get the shareable link of the CSV file from Google Drive. It should look something like this: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing`, where `FILE_ID` is the unique identifier of the file.

2. Modify the link to get the direct download link. Replace `/view?usp=sharing` with `&export=download`. The modified link should look something like this: `https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download`.

3. Use the modified link to read the CSV file in pandas using the `read_csv()` function. Here's an example:

```
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Replace `FILE_ID` with the unique identifier of your CSV file.

Note that if the CSV file is not publicly shared, you may need to authenticate with Google Drive to access it. You can use the `gdown` package to download the file and then read it in pandas. Here's an example:

```
!pip install gdown

import pandas as pd
import gdown

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID'
output = 'data.csv'
gdown.download(url, output, quiet=False)

df = pd.read_csv(output)
```

Replace `FILE_ID` with the unique identifier of your CSV file. The `gdown.download()` function will prompt you to authenticate with Google Drive if necessary.

To read a CSV file from Google Drive in pandas, you need to first get the shareable link of the file and then modify it to get the direct download link. Here are the steps:

1. Get the shareable link of the CSV file from Google Drive. It should look something like this: https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing

2. Replace the "/view?usp=sharing" part of the link with "/uc?export=download". The modified link should look like this: https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=FILE_ID

3. Use the modified link to read the CSV file in pandas using the `read_csv()` function.

Here's the code to read the CSV file from Google Drive in pandas:

```
import pandas as pd

url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=0B6GhBwm5vaB2ekdlZW5WZnppb28'
df = pd.read_csv(url)
```

Note that you need to replace the `FILE_ID` in the modified link with the actual ID of your CSV file. You can find the ID in the original shareable link of the file.

To read a CSV file from Google Drive in pandas, you need to first get the shareable link of the file and then modify it to get the direct download link. Here's how you can do it:

1. Get the shareable link of the CSV file from Google Drive. It should look something like this: 

   ```
   https://drive.google.com/file/d/FILE_ID/view?usp=sharing
   ```

2. Replace the `FILE_ID` in the link with `uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download`. The modified link should look like this:

   ```
   https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download
   ```

3. Use the modified link to read the CSV file in pandas:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   url = 'https://drive.google.com/uc?id=FILE_ID&export=download'
   df = pd.read_csv(url)
   ```

   Replace `FILE_ID` with the actual file ID from the shareable link.

   Note: If the CSV file is not publicly accessible, you may need to authenticate with Google Drive API to download the file.
