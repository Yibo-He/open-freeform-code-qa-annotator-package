I have a dictionary like this:

```
my_dict = {'Southampton': '33.7%', 'Cherbourg': '55.36%', 'Queenstown': '38.96%'}
```


How can I have a simple plot with 3 bars showing the values of each key in a dictionary?

I've tried:

```
sns.barplot(x=my_dict.keys(), y = int(my_dict.values()))
```


But I get :

> TypeError: int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'dict_values'

The error is because you're trying to convert a list-like object (dictionary values) to an integer, which is not possible. Also, your values are strings with a '%' sign, you need to remove that and convert them to float before plotting.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

my_dict = {'Southampton': '33.7%', 'Cherbourg': '55.36%', 'Queenstown': '38.96%'}

# Remove '%' sign and convert to float
my_dict = {k: float(v.rstrip('%')) for k, v in my_dict.items()}

plt.bar(my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values())
plt.show()
```

In this code, we first convert the dictionary values to float after removing the '%' sign. Then, we use matplotlib's `bar` function to create a bar plot. The keys of the dictionary are used as the x-values, and the values of the dictionary are used as the heights of the bars. Finally, `plt.show()` is used to display the plot.

The error is because you're trying to convert a list of strings (which are actually percentages) to integers. You need to convert these percentages to float values before plotting. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

my_dict = {'Southampton': '33.7%', 'Cherbourg': '55.36%', 'Queenstown': '38.96%'}

# Convert the percentage strings to float values
my_dict = {k: float(v.strip('%')) for k, v in my_dict.items()}

plt.bar(my_dict.keys(), my_dict.values())
plt.show()
```

This code will create a bar plot with the keys of the dictionary on the x-axis and the values on the y-axis. The `strip('%')` function is used to remove the '%' sign from the values, and then they are converted to float.
