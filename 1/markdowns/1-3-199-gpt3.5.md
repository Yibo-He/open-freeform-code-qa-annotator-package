----------

I am currently developing a Python program which has a segment which uses a headless version of Chrome and Selenium to perform a repetitive process. I am aiming to run the program on Lambda.
The overall program has around 1GB of dependencies so the option to use the standard method of using a [.zip archive](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/python-package.html), containing all my function code and dependencies is not an option as the total unzipped size of the function and all layers can't exceed the unzipped deployment package size limit of 250 MB.
So, that is where the new [AWS Lambda – Container Image Support](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/new-for-aws-lambda-container-image-support/) (I used this linked tutorial to develop this whole implementation so please read if you need more info) comes in. This allows me to package and deploy my Lambda function as container images of up to 10 GB in size.
I am using the base image hosted in ECR Public provided by AWS which runs Amazon Linux 2. Firstly - in my Dockerfile I:
- - - - - 
and finally - I install both Chrome (87.0.4280.88 at the time of reading) and Chromedriver (87.0.4280.88)
- 
there is a possibility this could be where the problem lies, but I highly doubt this as both are the same version - [ChromeDriver uses the same version number scheme as Chrome](https://www.chromium.org/developers/version-numbers).
This is my :

# 5) SET CMD OF HANDLER.

```

This image always builds without a problem and creates my image as expected.
and my  file:
```
version: "3.7"
services:
  lambda:
    image: tbg-lambda:latest
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    env_file:
     - ./params.env
```

So - now that the image is build I can test locally with cURL. Here, I am passing an empty JSON payload:
```
curl -XPOST "http://localhost:8080/2015-03-31/functions/function/invocations" -d '{}'
```

which runs the whole program perfectly start to end using Chrome headless mode with no errors.
So great - the Docker container works locally and as expected.
Lets upload it to ECR so I can use it with my Lambda Function (ECR URL changed for security):
```
aws ecr create-repository --repository-name tbg-lambda:latest --image-scanning-configuration scanOnPush=true
docker tag tbg-lambda:latest 123412341234.dkr.ecr.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/tbg-lambda:latest
aws ecr get-login-password | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin 123412341234.dkr.ecr.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com
docker push 123412341234.dkr.ecr.sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/tbg-lambda:latest
```

Everything pushes up as expected - I then create my new lambda function, choosing "Container Image" as the function option and attach the IAM role with all the permissions I need:

I have the memory set the max value just to ensure this isn't the problem:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/1pUO5.png)
Ok - so lets to get to the 
I use a test event to invoke the function through the console:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/kKHzm.png)
Everything runs perfectly until it hits the code which creates the webdriver driver with Chrome:
```
options = Options()
    options.add_argument('--no-sandbox')
    options.add_argument('--headless')
    options.add_argument('--single-process')
    options.add_argument('--disable-dev-shm-usage')
    options.add_argument('--remote-debugging-port=9222')
    options.add_argument('--disable-infobars')
    driver = webdriver.Chrome(
        service_args=["--verbose", "--log-path={}".format(logPath)],
        executable_path=f"/usr/local/bin/chromedriver",
        options=options
    )
```

PS: logPath is just another folder in the project directory - the logs output here as expected, the logs are shown below.

```

One thing that I might think could be the problem would the way lambda is running this container vs how I am running it locally.
Alot of people reccomend  to not run chrome as root - so is Lambda running the container as root and thats what is causing this? If so how can I tell Lambda or Docker to run the code as a non-root user.
This is mentioned here: [https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome/issues/46#issuecomment-484562558](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-google-chrome/issues/46#issuecomment-484562558)
I have been fighting with this error pretty much since AWS announced the lambda containers so any help with this would be brilliant  Please ask for any more info if I missed something!
Thanks in advance.

It seems like the issue is related to running Chrome as root. Lambda runs containers as the root user by default, which can cause issues with Chrome and other applications that require non-root access. To fix this, you can add a user to the Dockerfile and switch to that user before running Chrome.

Here's an updated Dockerfile that adds a user and switches to that user before installing Chrome and Chromedriver:

```
# 1) DOWNLOAD BASE IMAGE.
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python:3.8

# 2) DEFINE GLOBAL ARGS.
ARG MAIN_FILE="main.py"
ARG ENV_FILE="params.env"
ARG REQUIREMENTS_FILE="requirements.txt"
ARG FUNCTION_ROOT="."
ARG RUNTIME_VERSION="3.8"

# 3) COPY FILES.
# Copy The Main .py File.
COPY ${MAIN_FILE} ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Copy The .env File.
COPY ${ENV_FILE} ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Copy The requirements.txt File.
COPY ${REQUIREMENTS_FILE} ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}
# Copy Helpers Folder.
COPY helpers/ ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/helpers/
# Copy Private Folder.
COPY priv/ ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/priv/
# Copy Source Data Folder.
COPY source_data/ ${LAMBDA_TASK_ROOT}/source_data/

# 4) INSTALL DEPENDENCIES.
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip python3.8 -m pip install --upgrade pip
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip python3.8 -m pip install wheel
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip python3.8 -m pip install urllib3
RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --default-timeout=100

# 5) ADD USER AND SWITCH TO USER.
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash lambdauser
USER lambdauser

# 6) DOWNLOAD & INSTALL CHROMEIUM + CHROMEDRIVER.
#RUN yum -y upgrade
RUN sudo yum -y install wget unzip libX11 nano wget unzip xorg-x11-xauth xclock xterm

# Install Chrome
RUN wget https://intoli.com/install-google-chrome.sh
RUN bash install-google-chrome.sh

# Install Chromedriver
RUN wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/87.0.4280.88/chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN unzip ./chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN rm ./chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN mv -f ./chromedriver /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/chromedriver

# 7) SET CMD OF HANDLER.
CMD [ "main.lambda_handler" ]
```

Note the addition of the `USER` and `useradd` commands, which add a user named `lambdauser` and switch to that user before installing Chrome and Chromedriver.

You can then rebuild and push the updated image to ECR, and try running the Lambda function again. This should hopefully resolve the issue with Chrome crashing.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue is related to running Chrome as root. Lambda runs the container as the root user by default, which can cause issues with Chrome and other applications that are not designed to run as root. To fix this, you can try running the container as a non-root user.

One way to do this is to add a user to the Docker image and switch to that user before running the Chrome driver. Here's an example Dockerfile that adds a user and switches to that user before installing Chrome and Chromedriver:

```
# 1) DOWNLOAD BASE IMAGE.

RUN --mount=type=cache,target=/root/.cache/pip python3.8 -m pip install -r requirements.txt --default-timeout=100

# 5) DOWNLOAD & INSTALL CHROMEIUM + CHROMEDRIVER.
#RUN yum -y upgrade
RUN yum -y install wget unzip libX11 nano wget unzip xorg-x11-xauth xclock xterm

# Add a non-root user
RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash myuser

# Install Chrome
USER myuser
RUN wget https://intoli.com/install-google-chrome.sh
RUN bash install-google-chrome.sh

# Install Chromedriver
RUN wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/87.0.4280.88/chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN unzip ./chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN rm ./chromedriver_linux64.zip
RUN mv -f ./chromedriver /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
RUN chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/chromedriver

# Switch back to root user
USER root

# 6) SET CMD OF HANDLER.
CMD [ "main.lambda_handler" ]
```

In this example, we add a user called "myuser" and switch to that user before installing Chrome and Chromedriver. We then switch back to the root user before setting the CMD.

You can also try running the container with the `--user` flag to specify a non-root user to run the container as. For example:

```
docker run --user myuser tbg-lambda:latest
```

This will run the container as the "myuser" user instead of the root user.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that Chrome failed to start and crashed. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as incompatible versions of Chrome and Chromedriver, missing dependencies, or permission issues.

One thing to check is whether the Lambda function is running as root or as a non-root user. Running Chrome as root is not recommended and could cause issues. You can try running the container as a non-root user by adding the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
USER nobody
```

This will switch the user to the "nobody" user, which has limited permissions. You can also specify a different user if needed.

Another thing to check is whether all the necessary dependencies are installed in the Lambda container. You can try installing additional dependencies and see if that resolves the issue.

Finally, you can try running the Lambda function with increased verbosity to get more detailed error messages. You can do this by setting the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable to `DEBUG` or `INFO`. This will output more detailed logs that can help diagnose the issue.

Overall, troubleshooting issues with Lambda containers can be challenging, but by checking permissions, dependencies, and logs, you should be able to narrow down the issue and find a solution.
