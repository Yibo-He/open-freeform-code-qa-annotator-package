I'm trying to create a function that turns text into pig Latin: simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. But all I get is an empty list. Any tips?
```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    return word

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The problem with your code is that you are returning the word immediately after processing the first word in the text. This causes the function to exit and not process the remaining words. Also, you are not storing the processed words anywhere to return them all together.

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this version, we create a list `pig_latin_words` to store the processed words. After processing each word, we append it to this list. At the end of the function, we join all the words in the list with a space and return the result.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The problem with your function is that it returns the result after processing the first word. The `return` statement should be outside the loop to ensure that all words are processed. Also, you need to append the processed words to a list and then join them into a string. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    result = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        result.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(result)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

This function works by splitting the input text into words, then for each word, it takes the substring from the second character to the end, appends the first character and 'ay', and adds the result to the `result` list. Finally, it joins all the words in the `result` list into a string with spaces in between.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The problem with your code is that you are returning the word immediately after transforming the first word in the text. This causes the function to exit and not process the remaining words. 

Also, you are not storing the transformed words anywhere. You need to store each transformed word in a list and then join them into a string at the end.

Here is a corrected version of your code:

```python
def pig_latin(text):
    words = text.split()
    pig_latin_words = []
    for word in words:
        endString = word[1:] + word[0].lower() + 'ay'
        pig_latin_words.append(endString)
    return ' '.join(pig_latin_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

This code splits the input text into words, transforms each word into pig Latin by moving the first character to the end and appending "ay", and then joins the transformed words back into a string.
