I have a rather simple strip plot with vertical data.
```
planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")
sns.stripplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, size=4, color=".7")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.show()
```

I want to plot the mean of each x-element (`method`) as a small horizontal bar similar to what you get with:
```
sns.boxplot(
    x="method",
    y="distance",
    data=planets,
    whis=[50, 50],
    showfliers=False,
    showbox=False,
    showcaps=False
)
```

But without the vertical lines (with `whis=[50,50]` just spots) for the first / third quartile and showing mean instead of median. Maybe there is a more elegant solution not involving a Boxplot.
Thanks in advance.

You can plot the mean of each x-element as a small horizontal bar by using the `pointplot` function from seaborn. This function will plot the mean (or other estimator) of `y` for each level of `x`. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")

# Create the stripplot
sns.stripplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, size=4, color=".7")

# Add the pointplot (with bars representing the confidence interval around the mean)
sns.pointplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, color=".1", ci="sd", join=False, estimator=np.mean)

plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.show()
```

In this code, the `pointplot` function is used with the `estimator` parameter set to `np.mean` to compute the mean of `y` for each level of `x`. The `ci` parameter is set to `"sd"` to compute the standard deviation of `y` for each level of `x` and use it as the size of the bars representing the confidence interval around the mean. The `join` parameter is set to `False` to avoid drawing a line connecting the means. The `color` parameter is set to `".1"` to make the bars black.

Note: You need to import numpy as `np` to use `np.mean` as the estimator.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use `sns.pointplot` to plot the mean of each `method` and set `join=False` to avoid the line joining the points. Here is an example:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")

# Create the strip plot
sns.stripplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, size=4, color=".7")
plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")

# Add the point plot for the means
sns.pointplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, join=False, estimator=np.mean, color='r', markers='_', ci=None)

plt.show()
```

In this code, `estimator=np.mean` is used to calculate the mean of `distance` for each `method`. `color='r'` is used to set the color of the mean markers to red. `markers='_'` is used to use horizontal bars as markers. `ci=None` is used to not plot a confidence interval.

Please note that you need to import numpy as np to use `np.mean`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use `sns.pointplot` to plot the mean of each x-element (`method`) as a small horizontal bar. You can set `join=False` to avoid the line between points and `ci=None` to avoid the confidence interval around the mean. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

planets = sns.load_dataset("planets")

sns.stripplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, size=4, color=".7")
sns.pointplot(x="method", y="distance", data=planets, join=False, ci=None, color='r', markers='_')

plt.xticks(rotation=45, ha="right")
plt.show()
```

In this code, `sns.pointplot` is used to plot the mean of `distance` for each `method`. The `join=False` option is used to avoid drawing a line between the points, and `ci=None` is used to avoid drawing a confidence interval around the mean. The color of the mean line is set to red (`color='r'`) and the marker is set to underscore (`markers='_'`) to make it look like a small horizontal bar.
