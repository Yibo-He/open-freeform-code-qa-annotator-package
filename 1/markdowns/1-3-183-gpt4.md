Given a simple binary mask (e.g. the boundary of a rectangle).

![binary mask](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3kmz.png)

How can I use a polygon to get the x-y coordinates?

This is what I have tried so far:

```
coords = np.transpose(np.nonzero(mask))
```


However, this approach generates a filled object and not the desired boundary.

```
plt.plot(coords[:, 1], coords[:,0])
```


![unwanted output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/rFrwN.png)

Basically, I want a list of x-y coordinates of the white pixels to use this list to re-draw the rectangle (not filled).

You can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage.measure` module to find the boundary of the object in the binary image. This function returns a list of contours found in the image, where each contour is an array of x, y coordinates.

Here is a simple example:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from skimage.measure import find_contours

# Assuming 'mask' is your binary image
contours = find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# 'find_contours' returns a list of contours, so you need to get the first one
# Also, the y, x coordinates are swapped, so you need to swap them back
coords = np.fliplr(contours[0])

# Now you can plot the boundary
plt.plot(coords[:, 0], coords[:, 1])
plt.show()
```

This will give you the x, y coordinates of the boundary pixels. Note that the `0.5` in the `find_contours` function is the level at which to find contours in the image. Since your image is binary, you can use `0.5` to find the boundary between the white and black regions.

Also, please note that the `find_contours` function returns the coordinates in (row, column) format (which corresponds to (y, x) in image coordinates), so you need to flip the coordinates to get them in the usual (x, y) format.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the OpenCV library to find the contours of the binary mask, which will give you the boundary of the rectangle. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Assuming 'mask' is your binary image
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# Get the coordinates of the first contour. 
# If there are multiple contours, you may need to loop through them.
contour = contours[0]

# Reshape the contour array to a 2D array of coordinates
coords = contour.reshape(-1, 2)

# Separate x and y coordinates
x = coords[:, 0]
y = coords[:, 1]

# Plot the boundary
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.show()
```

This will give you the x-y coordinates of the boundary of the rectangle. The `cv2.findContours` function finds the contours in a binary image, where white pixels are considered as the foreground. The `cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL` flag retrieves only the extreme outer contours (ignores holes). The `cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE` flag compresses horizontal, vertical, and diagonal segments and leaves only their end points.

Please note that OpenCV uses (row, column) format to represent coordinates, which corresponds to (y, x) in the Cartesian system. So, you might need to swap x and y when plotting or using the coordinates elsewhere.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use the OpenCV library to find the contours of the binary mask. The function `cv2.findContours` returns a list of points on the boundary of the object. Here is an example:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np

# Assuming 'mask' is your binary image
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask, cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)

# 'contours' is a list of contours found, each contour is a list of points
# For a simple rectangle, you should have only one contour
# Let's take the first contour as an example
contour = contours[0]

# 'contour' is a numpy array of shape (n, 1, 2), you may want to reshape it into (n, 2)
contour = contour.reshape(-1, 2)

# Now 'contour' is a list of (x, y) coordinates of the white pixels on the boundary
# You can plot it using matplotlib
plt.plot(contour[:, 0], contour[:, 1])
plt.show()
```

Note that the y-coordinates in the image are from top to bottom, while the y-coordinates in the plot are from bottom to top. If you want the plot to look the same as the image, you can flip the y-coordinates:

```python
plt.plot(contour[:, 0], -contour[:, 1])
plt.show()
```

Also, the `cv2.findContours` function modifies the input image, so if you want to keep the original image, you should pass a copy of the image to the function:

```python
contours, _ = cv2.findContours(mask.copy(), cv2.RETR_EXTERNAL, cv2.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE)
```
