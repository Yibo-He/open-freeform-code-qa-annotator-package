I am importing string and trying to check if text contains only "a-z", "A-Z", and "0-9".

But I get only input and it doesn't print success when I enter letters and digits

```
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if text in correct:
    print("Success")
```

The issue with your code is that you are checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each character of the input string is within the `correct` string. 

You can fix this by iterating over each character in the input string and checking if it is in the `correct` string. If you find a character that is not in the `correct` string, you can print a failure message and break the loop. If you make it through the entire string without finding any incorrect characters, you can print a success message.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import string

text = input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

for char in text:
    if char not in correct:
        print("Failure")
        break
else:  # This else corresponds to the for loop, not the if statement
    print("Success")
```

In this code, the `else` block after the `for` loop will only execute if the `for` loop completes without encountering a `break` statement. This means that if any character in `text` is not in `correct`, the program will print "Failure" and then stop checking the rest of the characters. If all characters in `text` are in `correct`, the program will print "Success".

The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string `text` is in the `correct` string, not if each individual character in `text` is in `correct`. 

Here's how you can modify your code to check each character:

```python
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits

if all(c in correct for c in text):
    print("Success")
```

In this code, `all(c in correct for c in text)` will return `True` if all characters in `text` are in `correct`, and `False` otherwise.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue with your code is that you're checking if the entire input string is within the `correct` string, not if each individual character is within `correct`. 

You can use the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if all characters in the input are in `correct`. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import string
text=input("Enter: ")
correct = string.ascii_letters + string.digits
if all(char in correct for char in text):
    print("Success")
```

This code will check each character in `text` to see if it's in `correct`. If all characters are in `correct`, it will print "Success".
