I have a `string` like below in `python`
```
testing_abc
```

I want to split string based on `_` and extract the `2` element
I have done like below
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I am getting the correct output as expected
```
abc
```

Now I want this to work for below strings
```
1) xyz
```

When I use
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get below error
```
list index out of range
```

expected output I want is `xyz`
```
2) testing_abc_bbc
```

When I use
```
split_string = string.split('_')[1]
```

I get `abc` as output
expected output I want is `abc_bbc`
Basically What I want is
```
1) If string contains `_` then print everything after the first `_` as variable
2) If string doesn't contain `_` then print the string as variable
```

How can I achieve what I want

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

You can achieve this by checking if the string contains `_` or not. If it does, then you can use the `split` function and join all elements after the first one. If it doesn't, then you can just return the string itself. Here is how you can do it:

```python
def get_string_after_underscore(s):
    if '_' in s:
        return '_'.join(s.split('_')[1:])
    else:
        return s
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(get_string_after_underscore('testing_abc'))  # Output: abc
print(get_string_after_underscore('xyz'))  # Output: xyz
print(get_string_after_underscore('testing_abc_bbc'))  # Output: abc_bbc
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can achieve this by using the `partition` function in Python. The `partition` function returns a tuple that includes the separator (the text that matches the argument), the first half and the end half of the string.

Here is how you can use it:

```python
def split_string(s):
    _, _, split_string = s.partition('_')
    return split_string if split_string else s

print(split_string('testing_abc'))  # abc
print(split_string('xyz'))  # xyz
print(split_string('testing_abc_bbc'))  # abc_bbc
```

In this function, we use the `partition` function to split the string at the first occurrence of `_`. If `_` is not in the string, the function returns the original string. If `_` is in the string, the function returns everything after the first `_`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by using the `partition` function in Python. The `partition` function returns a tuple that includes the separator (the text that we are splitting on), the first half and the second half of the string.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
def split_string(s):
    _, _, after = s.partition('_')
    return after if _ else s

print(split_string('testing_abc')) # abc
print(split_string('xyz')) # xyz
print(split_string('testing_abc_bbc')) # abc_bbc
```

In this function, we are splitting the string on the first `_` character. If the string contains `_`, then the function will return everything after the `_`. If the string does not contain `_`, then the function will return the original string.
