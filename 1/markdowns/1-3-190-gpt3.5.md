I would like a way to integrate django with mqtt and for that the first thing that came in my mind was using django-channels and an mqtt broker that supports mqtt over web sockets, so I could communicate directly between the broker and django-channels.
However, I did not found a way to start a websocket client from django, and acording to this [link](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/add-a-websocket-client-to-django-not-a-server/2916/8) it's not possible.
Since I'm also starting to study task queues I wonder if it would be a good practice to start an mqtt client using paho-mqtt and then run that in a separate process using celery. This process would then forward the messages receives by the broker to django channels through websockets, this way I could also communicate with the client process, to publish data or stop the mqtt client when needed, and all that directly from django.
I'm a little skeptical about this idea since I also read that process run in celery should not take too long to complete, and in this case that's exactly what I want to do.
So my question is, how much of a bad idea that is? Is there any other option to directly integrate django with mqtt?

Your idea of using Celery to run the MQTT client in a separate process and forward messages to Django Channels through websockets is a good approach. It is a common practice to use Celery for long-running tasks, and it can handle the MQTT client process without any issues.

Regarding the concern about the length of the process, Celery is designed to handle long-running tasks, and you can configure it to handle tasks that take longer to complete. You can also use Celery's concurrency options to control how many tasks run simultaneously, which can help manage resources.

Another option to integrate Django with MQTT is to use a third-party library like Django-MQTT. This library provides a Django interface for MQTT, allowing you to publish and subscribe to MQTT topics directly from Django views. However, it does not support MQTT over websockets, so you would need to use a separate MQTT client library to handle the websockets connection.

In summary, using Celery to run the MQTT client in a separate process and forward messages to Django Channels through websockets is a good approach. It provides a scalable and flexible solution for integrating Django with MQTT.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Your idea of using Celery to run an MQTT client in a separate process is a good approach. Celery is designed to handle long-running tasks, so it should work well for this use case. 

Another option to directly integrate Django with MQTT is to use the Django-MQTT package. This package provides a Django app that can be used to connect to an MQTT broker and subscribe to topics. It also provides a Django model to store received messages. However, it does not support MQTT over websockets, so you would need to use a broker that supports MQTT over TCP.

Overall, using Celery to run an MQTT client in a separate process is a good approach and should work well for your use case.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Your idea of using Celery to run an MQTT client in a separate process and forward messages to Django Channels through websockets is a good approach. Celery is designed to handle long-running tasks, so it should be able to handle the MQTT client process without any issues.

Another option to directly integrate Django with MQTT is to use the Django-MQTT package. This package provides a simple way to connect to an MQTT broker and subscribe to topics. It also includes a Django model to store MQTT messages in the database.

However, Django-MQTT does not provide direct integration with Django Channels. You would need to write some additional code to forward MQTT messages to Django Channels.

Overall, using Celery to run an MQTT client in a separate process is a good approach for integrating Django with MQTT. It provides a clean separation of concerns and allows you to easily communicate with the MQTT client process from Django.
