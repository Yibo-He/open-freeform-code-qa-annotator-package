Is there a way how to display the counted value of the histogram aggregate in the Plotly.Express histogram?
`px.histogram(pd.DataFrame({"A":[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]}),x="A")`

If I would use regular histogram, I can specify `text` parameter which direct to the column which contain the value to display.
`px.bar(pd.DataFrame({"val":[1,2,3,4,5], "height": [3,2,3,3,1]}), x="val", y="height", text="height")`

But with histograms, this value is calculated and it's not even part of the `fig.to_dict()`. Is there a way to add the text labels into histogram?
Using the answers below, I've summarized the finding to an article - [https://towardsdatascience.com/histograms-with-plotly-express-complete-guide-d483656c5ad7](https://towardsdatascience.com/histograms-with-plotly-express-complete-guide-d483656c5ad7)

Yes, you can add text labels to a histogram in Plotly Express. However, it's not as straightforward as with a bar chart because the histogram's values are calculated during the plot creation. 

Here's a workaround using your example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

# Create the DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame({"A":[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]})

# Create the histogram
fig = px.histogram(df, x="A")

# Calculate the histogram data
hist_data = pd.value_counts(df['A']).sort_index()

# Add text annotations
for i, bin in enumerate(hist_data.index):
    fig.add_annotation(
        x=bin, 
        y=hist_data.iloc[i], 
        text=str(hist_data.iloc[i]), 
        showarrow=False,
        yshift=10)

fig.show()
```

In this code:

1. We first create the histogram using `px.histogram()`.
2. Then, we calculate the histogram data manually using `pd.value_counts()`. This gives us a Series where the index is the bin values and the values are the counts.
3. We then loop through each bin in the histogram data and add a text annotation at that bin's x position and the corresponding count's y position. The `showarrow=False` argument hides the annotation arrow, and `yshift=10` moves the text slightly above the bar.
4. Finally, we display the plot with `fig.show()`.

This will give you a histogram with the count displayed above each bar.

Yes, you can display the counted value of the histogram aggregate in Plotly.Express histogram. However, it's not as straightforward as with the bar plot because the histogram's height is calculated during the plotting. 

Here's a workaround using `numpy.histogram` to calculate the histogram values first, then plot it as a bar plot:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import plotly.express as px

# Your data
df = pd.DataFrame({"A":[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]})

# Calculate histogram values
hist, edges = np.histogram(df["A"], bins=range(1,7))

# Create a new DataFrame for plotting
df_hist = pd.DataFrame({"val": edges[:-1], "height": hist})

# Create a bar plot with text labels
fig = px.bar(df_hist, x="val", y="height", text="height")

fig.show()
```

This will create a bar plot that looks like a histogram, with the counted values displayed on top of each bar. 

Please note that this workaround might not be suitable for all use cases, especially when you have a large number of bins or non-integer bin edges. In such cases, you might need to adjust the binning process accordingly.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can display the counted value of the histogram aggregate in Plotly.Express histogram by using the `fig.data` attribute to access the calculated histogram data and then adding annotations to the figure for each bar in the histogram. Here is an example:

```python
import pandas as pd
import plotly.express as px

df = pd.DataFrame({"A":[1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,5]})
fig = px.histogram(df, x="A")

for trace in fig.data:
    trace.name = ''  # remove legend
    fig.add_trace(go.Scatter(
        x=trace.x,
        y=trace.y,
        mode='text',
        text=trace.y,
        textposition='middle center',
        showlegend=False,
        hoverinfo='none'
    ))

fig.show()
```

In this code, `fig.data` is a tuple that contains the data for each trace in the figure. For a histogram, each trace corresponds to a bar in the histogram. The `x` and `y` attributes of each trace correspond to the position and height of the bar, respectively. The `add_trace` method is used to add a scatter plot to the figure for each bar in the histogram, where the `text` attribute is set to the height of the bar, and the `mode` attribute is set to 'text' to display the text. The `textposition` attribute is set to 'middle center' to position the text in the middle of the bar. The `showlegend` attribute is set to False to hide the legend, and the `hoverinfo` attribute is set to 'none' to disable the hover information for the scatter plot.
