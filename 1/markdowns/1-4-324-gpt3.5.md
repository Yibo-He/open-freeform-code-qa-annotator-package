Say for example I have a column that looks something like:
```
name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC
```

How could I split this column into separate columns such that it would yield a result similar as a data frame to:
```
name   | Age | City
1 Michael | 31  | NYC
```

I've attempted to use mtabulate from the qdapTools package but it only resulted with boolean value columns.

You can use the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns. Here's an example code:

```R
library(tidyr)

# create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(info = "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC")

# separate the info column into three columns
df_split <- separate(df, info, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",|:")

# remove the first column since it's no longer needed
df_split <- df_split[, -1]

# view the resulting data frame
df_split
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
```

You can use the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns based on a delimiter. Here's an example code:

```
library(tidyr)

# create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(info = "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC")

# separate the column into three columns based on the delimiter ","
df_split <- separate(df, col = info, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",")

# remove the prefix from each column
df_split$name <- gsub("name:", "", df_split$name)
df_split$Age <- gsub("Age:", "", df_split$Age)
df_split$City <- gsub("City:", "", df_split$City)

# display the resulting data frame
df_split
```

This should give you a data frame with three separate columns for name, Age, and City.

You can use the `separate()` function from the `tidyr` package to split the column into separate columns based on a delimiter. Here's an example code:

```
library(tidyr)

# create a sample data frame
df <- data.frame(col = "name:Michael,Age:31,City:NYC")

# separate the column into three columns based on the delimiter ","
df_new <- separate(df, col, into = c("name", "Age", "City"), sep = ",")

# remove the prefix from the columns
df_new <- data.frame(lapply(df_new, function(x) sub("^\\w+:", "", x)))

# print the new data frame
df_new
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
     name Age City
1 Michael  31  NYC
```
