```
d1 <- data.frame(a=c(1,2,3))
d2 <- data.frame(a=c(3,4,5))
d3 <- cbind(d1,d2)
```

doesn't return an error, and an inspection of the environment in RStudio displays two columns with the same name.
If I type:
```
d3$a
```

The first column is selected. How to select the second by name?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator and specify the column name as a string:

```
d3[["a.x"]]
```

This will select the second column, which was named "a" in the original `d2` data frame and was renamed to "a.x" in `d3` due to the column name collision.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator and specify the name of the column as a string:

```
d3[["a.x"]]
```

This will select the second column, which has been automatically renamed to "a.x" to avoid having two columns with the same name.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To select the second column by name, you can use the `[[` operator with quotes around the column name. Here's an example:

```
d3[["a.x"]]
```

This will select the second column named "a.x".
