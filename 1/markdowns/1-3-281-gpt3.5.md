I am trying to build a wordle solver as a self project however I got stuck in a small part of my code. The method that checks for each letter in both the choice word and the guess work and color codes them is working perfectly unless there is a word with a duplicate letter (eg: the word SHARE would work correctly however the word GUESS would only color code GUES). I tried using counter but how exactly would I exactly input the letter at the right place in the list?
```
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = dict()
    choiceword = []
    guesslist = []
    guessdict = dict()
    choicedict = dict()
    for a in choice:
        choiceword.append(a)
    for b in guess:
        guesslist.append(b)

    for idx, value in enumerate(choiceword):
        choicedict[idx] = value

    for idx, value in enumerate(guesslist):
        guessdict[idx] = value

    guesscolor[0] = guesslist[0]
    guesscolor[1] = guesslist[1]
    guesscolor[2] = guesslist[2]
    guesscolor[3] = guesslist[3]
    guesscolor[4] = guesslist[4]

    counter = 0

    lengthofword = len(guesslist)

    totalsame = 0

    sameword = 0

    countsguess = Counter(guessh)
    duplicatesguess = [c for c in countsguess if countsguess[c] > 1]
    countschoice = Counter(choice)
    duplicateschoices = [c for c in countschoice if countschoice[c] > 1]

    for a in duplicateschoices:
        if a == None:
            duplicateschoices.append("None")
    for a in duplicatesguess:
        if a == None:
            duplicatesguess.append("None")

    while (counter < lengthofword):
        if guessdict[counter] in choicedict.values():

            totalsame += 1

            if choiceword[counter] == guesslist[counter]:
                print(f"The word at index {counter} is present in both strings in same place")
                sameword += 1
                a = guessdict[counter]
                guesscolor[a] = "green"



            else:
                a = guessdict[counter]
                guesscolor[a] = "orange"
            counter += 1


        else:
            a = guessdict[counter]
            guesscolor[a] = "red"
            counter += 1

    print(guesscolor)

    print("There are " + str(totalsame) + " duplicate characters." + str(sameword) + " of them are in the same place")


Game(0).wordcolor(choice, guessh)
```

Example output:
```
Computer choice word: eject 
Human Guess: ejjet (I haven't made the code to check guesses against dictionary) 
The word at index 0 is present in both strings in same place
The word at index 1 is present in both strings in same place
The word at index 4 is present in both strings in same place
{0: 'e', 1: 'j', 2: 'j', 3: 'e', 4: 't', 'e': 'orange', 'j': 'orange', 't': 'green'} (Ignores duplicate letters) 
There are 5 duplicate characters. 3 of them are in the same place
Incorrect Guess
```


```
Computer choice word: rotas 
Human Guess: share  
0: 's', 1: 'h', 2: 'a', 3: 'r', 4: 'e', 's': 'orange', 'h': 'red', 'a': 'orange', 'r': 'orange', 'e': 'red'}
There are 3 duplicate characters.0 of them are in the same place
Incorrect Guess
```

It seems like you are using a dictionary to store the color codes for each letter in the guess word. However, when there are duplicate letters in the guess word, the dictionary will only store the color code for the last occurrence of that letter.

One way to solve this issue is to use a list instead of a dictionary to store the color codes for each letter. You can initialize the list with the same length as the guess word and fill it with "red" initially. Then, when you find a matching letter in the choice word, you can update the corresponding index in the list with the appropriate color code.

Here's an example implementation using a list:

```
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = ["red"] * len(guess)
    choiceword = list(choice)

    totalsame = 0
    sameword = 0

    for i, letter in enumerate(guess):
        if letter in choiceword:
            totalsame += 1
            if letter == choiceword[i]:
                sameword += 1
                guesscolor[i] = "green"
            else:
                guesscolor[i] = "orange"

    print(guesscolor)
    print("There are " + str(totalsame) + " duplicate characters." + str(sameword) + " of them are in the same place")
```

In this implementation, `guesscolor` is initialized as a list of "red" strings with the same length as `guess`. Then, for each letter in `guess`, we check if it is present in `choiceword`. If it is, we update the corresponding index in `guesscolor` with the appropriate color code. Finally, we print the `guesscolor` list and the number of total duplicate characters and same-place characters.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

One way to handle the duplicate letters is to keep track of the indices of each occurrence of the letter in both the choice word and the guess word. You can then compare the indices to determine if the letter is in the same place or not. Here's an updated version of your `wordcolor` method that implements this approach:

```
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = {}
    choiceword = list(choice)
    guesslist = list(guess)

    # Find indices of each letter in choice word
    choicedict = {}
    for idx, letter in enumerate(choiceword):
        if letter not in choicedict:
            choicedict[letter] = []
        choicedict[letter].append(idx)

    # Find indices of each letter in guess word
    guessdict = {}
    for idx, letter in enumerate(guesslist):
        if letter not in guessdict:
            guessdict[letter] = []
        guessdict[letter].append(idx)

    # Color code each letter in guess word
    for idx, letter in enumerate(guesslist):
        if letter in choicedict:
            indices = choicedict[letter]
            if idx in indices:
                guesscolor[idx] = "green"
            else:
                for i in indices:
                    if i not in guesscolor:
                        guesscolor[i] = "orange"
        else:
            guesscolor[idx] = "red"

    print(guesscolor)

    # Count number of duplicate characters and number of characters in same place
    totalsame = sum(1 for idx in guesscolor if guesscolor[idx] == "green")
    sameword = sum(1 for idx in guesscolor if guesscolor[idx] == "green" and guesslist[idx] == choiceword[idx])
    print(f"There are {totalsame} duplicate characters. {sameword} of them are in the same place")

Game(0).wordcolor("rotas", "share")
```

This should correctly color code all occurrences of each letter in the guess word, and count the number of duplicate characters and characters in the same place.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To correctly color code the duplicate letters in the guess word, you can modify your code to keep track of the indices of each letter in the guess word and compare them with the indices of the same letter in the choice word. Here's an example implementation:

```
def wordcolor(self, choice, guess):
    guesscolor = {}
    choiceword = list(choice)
    guesslist = list(guess)

    # Find indices of each letter in guess word
    guessindices = {}
    for i, letter in enumerate(guesslist):
        if letter not in guessindices:
            guessindices[letter] = [i]
        else:
            guessindices[letter].append(i)

    for i, letter in enumerate(choiceword):
        if letter in guessindices:
            # Check if letter is in same position in both words
            if letter == guesslist[i]:
                guesscolor[i] = "green"
                guessindices[letter].remove(i)
            # Check if letter is in a different position in both words
            elif guessindices[letter]:
                guesscolor[i] = "orange"
                guessindices[letter].pop(0)
            # Letter is a duplicate but already colored
            else:
                guesscolor[i] = "red"
        else:
            guesscolor[i] = "red"

    print(guesscolor)
```

In this implementation, we first create a dictionary `guessindices` that maps each letter in the guess word to a list of its indices. We then iterate through each letter in the choice word and check if it is in `guessindices`. If it is, we first check if the letter is in the same position in both words, and color code it green if it is. If not, we check if there are any remaining indices of the letter in the guess word, and color code it orange if there are. If there are no remaining indices, it means the letter has already been colored as a duplicate, so we color code it red. If the letter is not in `guessindices`, we color code it red as well.

This implementation should correctly color code all duplicate letters in the guess word, even if they appear multiple times in the choice word.
