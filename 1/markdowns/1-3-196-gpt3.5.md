I would like to find out the size of conda packages to delete the huge and seldom used ones. Which conda command should I use to find out the package size?
`conda list` will list the packages but does not show the package size.
I welcome other methods to find out package size.
I'm using Windows 10.

You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the package size in bytes. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and hit enter.
3. Wait for the list of packages to load.
4. Look for the `size` column in the output. This column shows the package size in bytes.

Alternatively, you can use the `conda info` command to find out the size of a specific package. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda info <package-name>` and hit enter. Replace `<package-name>` with the name of the package you want to check.
3. Wait for the package information to load.
4. Look for the `size` field in the output. This field shows the package size in bytes.

You can also use the Windows File Explorer to find out the size of the `pkgs` folder in your Anaconda installation directory. This folder contains all the installed packages, so its size will give you an idea of how much space your packages are taking up. To find the `pkgs` folder, follow these steps:

1. Open the File Explorer.
2. Navigate to the Anaconda installation directory. By default, this is `C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3` on Windows 10.
3. Look for the `pkgs` folder and right-click on it.
4. Select "Properties" from the context menu.
5. The Properties dialog will show you the size of the folder in bytes, kilobytes, megabytes, and gigabytes.

You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the package size in bytes. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda list --show-channel-urls` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the list of packages to appear. The size of each package will be displayed in bytes in the rightmost column.

Alternatively, you can use the `conda info --json` command to get a JSON object containing information about all installed packages, including their size. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `conda info --json` and press Enter.
3. Wait for the JSON object to appear. Each package is represented as an object with a `size` property containing the package size in bytes.

You can also use the `du` command to find the size of the `pkgs` directory in your Anaconda installation. Here's how to do it:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Type `du -sh <path-to-anaconda>/pkgs` and press Enter, replacing `<path-to-anaconda>` with the actual path to your Anaconda installation.
3. Wait for the size of the `pkgs` directory to appear in a human-readable format. This will give you an idea of how much disk space your installed packages are taking up.

You can use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command to display the size of each package in your current environment. This command will show the package size in bytes.

Alternatively, you can use the `conda info --json` command to get information about your current environment in JSON format, including the size of each package. You can then use a JSON parser to extract the package size information.

Here's an example of how to use the `conda list --show-channel-urls` command:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Activate the environment for which you want to list the package sizes using the command `conda activate <environment_name>`.
3. Run the command `conda list --show-channel-urls`. This will display a list of all packages installed in the current environment, along with their version numbers and sizes.

Here's an example of how to use the `conda info --json` command:

1. Open the Anaconda Prompt or your terminal.
2. Activate the environment for which you want to list the package sizes using the command `conda activate <environment_name>`.
3. Run the command `conda info --json`. This will display information about your current environment in JSON format.
4. Use a JSON parser to extract the package size information. For example, you can use the following command to extract the size of the `numpy` package: `conda info --json | jq '.packages."numpy-1.19.2-py38hadc3359_0".size'`, assuming you have the `jq` JSON parser installed.
