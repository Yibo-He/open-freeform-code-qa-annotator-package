(Using latest miniconda + VS Code on 64-bit Windows10:) After clean reinstalling VS Code, I can no longer launch jupyter notebook from within it. When I tried to create a new jupyter file for the first time, the Python extension installed `ipykernel` in my virtual environment "da38" (my main working environment). Then it stays on `Connecting to IPython kernel: Connecting to kernel` for an unusually long time, and stops with the error message `Unable to start session for kernel Python 3.8.5 64-bit ('da38':conda)` (images pasted below). I also removed and re-created da38 environment just in case. Used jupyter many times before with no issues until this new VS Code install today, and an identical setup is working on my other computer. Any help is appreciated. Thanks!

This issue might be due to several reasons. Here are some steps you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your virtual environment "da38". You can check this by clicking on the Python version on the bottom left of the VS Code status bar.

2. **Update Packages**: Update your Python packages, especially `ipykernel`, `ipython`, `jupyter_client`, `jupyter_core`, `traitlets`, and `tornado`. You can do this by activating your conda environment and running `conda update --all` or `pip install --upgrade <package_name>`.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter**: Try reinstalling Jupyter in your virtual environment. Activate your conda environment and run `pip uninstall jupyter` followed by `pip install jupyter`.

4. **Check Jupyter Path**: Ensure that the Jupyter server is being started from the correct path. You can check this by running `jupyter --paths` in your terminal. If the paths are incorrect, you can correct them by setting the `JUPYTER_PATH` environment variable.

5. **Check VS Code Settings**: Check your VS Code settings (`.vscode/settings.json` in your workspace or `File > Preferences > Settings` for global settings). Make sure the Python path is correct and the Jupyter settings are properly configured.

6. **Check for Errors**: Check the Jupyter server logs for any errors. You can also try running a Jupyter notebook from the command line to see if it works outside of VS Code.

7. **VS Code Python Extension**: Try uninstalling and reinstalling the Python extension in VS Code.

If none of these steps work, it might be helpful to provide more information about your setup, such as the versions of the packages you're using and any error messages you're seeing in the logs.

Based on the information you provided, it seems like the issue might be related to the Python interpreter selected in VS Code. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check the Python Interpreter**: Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your virtual environment "da38". You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code. If it's not the correct one, you can select it from the list.

2. **Check the Jupyter Server**: VS Code uses the Jupyter server to run the notebooks. Make sure that the Jupyter server is running correctly. You can try to run it manually from the command line using the command `jupyter notebook`.

3. **Reinstall Jupyter in your Virtual Environment**: It's possible that the Jupyter installation in your virtual environment is corrupted. You can try to reinstall it using the following commands:

   ```
   conda activate da38
   conda install jupyter
   ```

4. **Check the Python Extension**: Make sure that the Python extension is installed and enabled in VS Code. If it's already installed, you can try to uninstall and reinstall it.

5. **Check the VS Code Settings**: Check the settings of VS Code to make sure that it's correctly configured to use Jupyter. You can find the settings in the `.vscode` folder in your workspace. The settings should look something like this:

   ```json
   {
     "python.pythonPath": "/path/to/your/virtual/environment",
     "python.dataScience.jupyterServerURI": "http://localhost:8888/?token=your_token"
   }
   ```

6. **Check the Logs**: If none of the above steps work, you can check the logs of VS Code to see if there are any error messages that can help you identify the issue. You can find the logs in the Output panel (View -> Output, change the dropdown to Python).

If none of these steps work, please provide more information about your setup (e.g., the version of VS Code, the Python extension, and Jupyter) and any error messages you see in the logs.

Based on the information you've provided, it seems like the Jupyter server is having trouble starting up. Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Python interpreter:** Make sure that the Python interpreter selected in VS Code is the one from your "da38" conda environment. You can check this by clicking on the Python version in the bottom left corner of VS Code, and then selecting the correct interpreter from the list.

2. **Check your Jupyter installation:** Make sure that Jupyter is properly installed in your "da38" conda environment. You can do this by activating your conda environment in the terminal and then running `jupyter notebook`. If Jupyter is not installed, you can install it with `conda install jupyter`.

3. **Check your ipykernel version:** The ipykernel package is what allows Jupyter to interact with your Python code. It's possible that there's a version mismatch between Jupyter and ipykernel. You can check the version of ipykernel in your "da38" environment by running `pip show ipykernel`. If it's not the latest version, you can update it with `pip install --upgrade ipykernel`.

4. **Check your VS Code settings:** It's possible that there's a setting in VS Code that's causing the issue. You can try resetting your VS Code settings to their default values to see if that resolves the issue. You can do this by going to File > Preferences > Settings and then searching for the setting you want to reset.

5. **Check your VS Code extensions:** There might be an issue with the Python extension for VS Code. You can try uninstalling and then reinstalling the Python extension to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, it might be helpful to look at the Jupyter server logs to see if there are any error messages that could help diagnose the problem. You can view the logs by running `jupyter notebook --debug` in your "da38" environment.
