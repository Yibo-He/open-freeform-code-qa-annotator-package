I am trying to install R 4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS but I keep getting errors of 

```

when trying to install. I have removed and deleted R 3.6.3 and have added 

```
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/
```


in my `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. Note that the above requires `libc6 (>= 2.29)` yet from what I have seen, it is NOT AVAILABLE for 18.04. Does this mean I have to upgrade to 19.04, or 20.04 in order to run R 4.0?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, it seems that `libc6 (>= 2.29)` is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. You can either upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 or 20.04 to install R 4.0 or you can try installing an older version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. 

To install an older version of R, you can try the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

This will install the latest version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. If you need a specific version of R, you can try adding the appropriate repository to your sources.list file. For example, to install R 3.6.3, you can add the following line to your sources.list file:

```
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran35/
```

After adding the repository, you can run the following command to install R 3.6.3:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base-core=3.6.3-1bionic
``` 

Note that this will only install the core components of R 3.6.3. If you need additional packages, you will need to install them separately.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, it seems that `libc6 (>= 2.29)` is not available for Ubuntu 18.04. You can either upgrade to Ubuntu 19.04 or 20.04 to install R 4.0, or you can try to install an older version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. 

To install an older version of R, you can try the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base
```

This should install the latest version of R that is compatible with Ubuntu 18.04. If you need a specific version of R, you can check the available versions by running the following command:

```
apt-cache showpkg r-base
```

This will show you a list of available versions of R that you can install. You can then install a specific version by specifying the version number in the command, for example:

```
sudo apt-get install r-base=3.6.3-1bionic
```

This will install R version 3.6.3 on Ubuntu 18.04.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, it seems that R 4.0 requires a newer version of `libc6` than what is available in Ubuntu 18.04. You can try upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 which has `libc6` version 2.31, which should be compatible with R 4.0. Alternatively, you can try installing R 4.0 from source, which may require additional dependencies to be installed. Here are the steps to install R 4.0 from source:

1. Install the necessary dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install build-essential libcurl4-gnutls-dev libxml2-dev libssl-dev
```

2. Download the R 4.0 source code from the R website:

```
wget https://cran.r-project.org/src/base/R-4/R-4.0.0.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the source code:

```
tar -xzf R-4.0.0.tar.gz
```

4. Configure the build:

```
cd R-4.0.0
./configure --prefix=/usr/local --enable-R-shlib
```

5. Build and install R:

```
make
sudo make install
```

After these steps, R 4.0 should be installed on your system.
