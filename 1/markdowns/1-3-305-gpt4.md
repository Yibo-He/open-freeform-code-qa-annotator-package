When I run `conda search -c conda-forge nodejs`, I get:

```
# Name                       Version           Build  Channel
...
nodejs                        14.2.0      h2c41780_1  conda-forge
nodejs                        14.2.0      h38d8c5a_0  conda-forge
nodejs                        14.3.0      h2c41780_0  conda-forge
nodejs                        14.4.0      h2c41780_0  conda-forge
```


But when I try to install it using `conda install -c conda-forge nodejs` it tries to install 6.13.1. Doing `conda install -c conda-forge nodejs==14.4.0` also does not work. It keeps trying to "solve" the environment. Any suggestions on how to fix this?

The issue you're experiencing might be due to a conflict between the packages in your environment and the version of nodejs you're trying to install. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Create a new environment**: You can create a new conda environment and install nodejs there. This can help avoid conflicts with other packages. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n newenv
conda activate newenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

2. **Update conda**: Sometimes, the issue might be due to an outdated version of conda. You can update conda using the following command:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

After updating conda, try installing nodejs again.

3. **Explicitly specify the build**: You can also try to explicitly specify the build of nodejs you want to install. For example:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try using mamba, a reimplementation of conda that is designed to handle environment solving more efficiently. You can install mamba in your base environment with:

```bash
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Then, you can use mamba to install nodejs:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

Remember to replace `newenv` with the name you want for your new environment.

The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few suggestions:

1. **Update Conda:** Your Conda version might be outdated, which could be causing the problem. Update it by running `conda update -n base -c defaults conda`.

2. **Create a new environment:** Sometimes, the existing environment has conflicting packages that prevent the installation of a new package. Create a new environment and try installing Node.js in that environment. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
conda create -n myenv
conda activate myenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

3. **Specify the version and build:** You can also try specifying the version and build in the install command like this:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba:** If none of the above solutions work, you can try using mamba, a faster, more robust package manager that's fully compatible with Conda. You can install it using `conda install mamba -c conda-forge`, and then use it to install Node.js like this:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs
```

Remember to replace `conda` with `mamba` in your commands when you're using mamba.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to a conflict between the packages in your environment and the version of nodejs you're trying to install. Here are a few suggestions you can try:

1. **Create a new environment**: Sometimes, the easiest way to resolve conflicts is to create a new environment and install the packages you need there. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n newenv
conda activate newenv
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

2. **Update conda**: If you're using an older version of conda, you might experience issues with package installations. You can update conda with the following command:

```bash
conda update -n base -c defaults conda
```

After updating conda, try installing nodejs again.

3. **Specify the build**: If you know the specific build of nodejs you want to install, you can specify it in the install command like this:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0=h2c41780_0
```

4. **Use mamba**: Mamba is a reimplementation of the conda package manager in C++. It's designed to be faster and more efficient than conda, and it can often resolve package conflicts that conda can't. You can install mamba with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
```

Then, you can use mamba to install nodejs like this:

```bash
mamba install -c conda-forge nodejs=14.4.0
```

Remember to replace `14.4.0` with the version you want to install.
