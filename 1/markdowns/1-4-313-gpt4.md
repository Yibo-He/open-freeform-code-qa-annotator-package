I am trying to install R 4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS but I keep getting errors of 

```

Some packages could not be installed. This may mean that you have

when trying to install. I have removed and deleted R 3.6.3 and have added 

```
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/
```


in my `/etc/apt/sources.list` file. Note that the above requires `libc6 (>= 2.29)` yet from what I have seen, it is NOT AVAILABLE for 18.04. Does this mean I have to upgrade to 19.04, or 20.04 in order to run R 4.0?

The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that R 4.0 has dependencies that are not available in Ubuntu 18.04's repositories. Upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 would likely solve the problem, as it has newer versions of the required libraries.

However, if you prefer to stay on Ubuntu 18.04, you can try installing R 4.0 from a different source that has been compiled with older dependencies. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, remove any existing R installation:

```
sudo apt remove r-base r-base-core r-recommended r-base-dev
```

2. Then, add the CRAN repository to your sources.list file:

```
sudo echo "deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list
```

3. Add the CRAN GPG key, which is used to sign the R packages:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

4. Update your system:

```
sudo apt update
```

5. Finally, install R:

```
sudo apt install r-base
```

This should install R 4.0 on your Ubuntu 18.04 system. If you still encounter problems, it may be necessary to upgrade your Ubuntu version.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is due to the fact that R 4.0 has dependencies that are not available in Ubuntu 18.04's repositories. Upgrading to Ubuntu 20.04 would solve this problem, as it includes the necessary versions of the dependencies. However, if you prefer to stay on Ubuntu 18.04, you can still install R 4.0 by adding the CRAN repositories to your sources list.

Here are the steps to do so:

1. First, add the CRAN GPG key to your system:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

2. Then, add the CRAN repository to your sources list. Open the sources list file using a text editor (like nano):

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

3. Add the following line to the file:

```bash
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/
```

4. Save and close the file.

5. Update your system's package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

6. Now, you should be able to install R 4.0:

```bash
sudo apt install r-base
```

If you still encounter issues, it might be due to previously installed R packages. You can remove them with:

```bash
sudo apt remove r-base r-base-dev r-recommended
sudo apt autoremove
```

And then try to install R 4.0 again.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that the version of R you're trying to install requires a newer version of libc6 than is available in Ubuntu 18.04. 

However, you don't necessarily need to upgrade your entire Ubuntu system to a newer version. Instead, you can try installing R from a different repository that provides a version compatible with your system.

Here are the steps to install R 4.0 on Ubuntu 18.04:

1. First, add the CRAN repository to your sources.list file. Open a terminal and type:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list
```

2. Add the following line to the file:

```bash
deb https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu bionic-cran40/
```

3. Save and exit the file (Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter).

4. Add the secure apt key:

```bash
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E298A3A825C0D65DFD57CBB651716619E084DAB9
```

5. Update the package list:

```bash
sudo apt update
```

6. Finally, install R:

```bash
sudo apt install r-base
```

This should install R 4.0 without requiring you to upgrade libc6 or your entire Ubuntu system. If you still encounter issues, it may be necessary to resolve any broken or held packages on your system. You can do this with the following commands:

```bash
sudo apt install -f
sudo dpkg --configure -a
```

Then try installing R again.
