i have two files, and i want to run both. The first one is basically asking down the prices of stocks and writes them to a database, and the second one using python dash to create a webpage. This webpage is showing the data in real time from the database which is constantly refreshes. I tried to use threading but it does not work, because the two files basically function as two infinite while loop. How should i solve this problem?
The two functions im having problem with are
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)
and
if  == "":
app.run_server(debug=True)
```
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()



if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run_server(debug=True)
```

You can use multiprocessing in Python to run these two tasks concurrently. Here's how you can do it:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def run_dash():
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    database=db.dataBase()
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create two processes
    p1 = Process(target=run_dash)
    p2 = Process(target=run_data_mining)

    # Start both processes
    p1.start()
    p2.start()

    # Wait for both processes to finish
    p1.join()
    p2.join()
```

This way, both the Dash server and the data mining script will run concurrently. The `Process` class in Python's multiprocessing module is used to create separate processes. The `start()` method starts the execution of these processes and the `join()` method makes sure that the main process waits until both processes have finished their execution.

Please note that multiprocessing creates separate processes and not threads. Each Python process gets its own Python interpreter and memory space so the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) is not a problem. This is why multiprocessing can truly leverage multiple CPUs and cores while multithreading in Python cannot due to the GIL.

You can use multiprocessing instead of threading. Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) makes it so that only one thread can execute Python bytecodes at a time in a single process. This is why your two infinite loops can't run concurrently using threads. 

Multiprocessing, on the other hand, spawns new processes, which have their own memory space and can run on different CPU cores. This allows for true parallelism.

Here is an example of how you can use multiprocessing:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def func1():
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

def func2():
    app.run_server(debug=True)

if __name__=='__main__':
    Process(target=func1).start()
    Process(target=func2).start()
```

In this example, `func1` and `func2` will run in separate processes and can execute concurrently. 

However, keep in mind that multiprocessing has a higher overhead than threading because it has to spawn a new process. Also, sharing data between processes is more difficult than sharing data between threads. If you need to share data between your two functions, you might need to use a multiprocessing-safe data structure like a Queue or a Pipe. 

Also, be aware that if you're running this on a web server, the server might not allow you to spawn new processes. In that case, you might need to run your two scripts as separate services.

def run_dash():
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database=db.dataBase()
    homepage=hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)

    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        app.run_server(debug=True)

def run_data_mining():
    dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    Process(target=run_dash).start()
    Process(target=run_data_mining).start()
```

This script will start two processes, one for the Dash server and one for the data mining script. They will run independently of each other.

Please note that multiprocessing in Python creates new processes. Each process gets its own Python interpreter and memory space so the Global Interpreter Lock is not a problem. However, sharing data between processes is more difficult than sharing data between threads. You might need to use a multiprocessing-safe data structure like a Queue or a Pipe, or use a shared database, to share data between your Dash server and your data mining script.

Also, be aware that if you're running this on Windows, you might need to protect the entry point of the program by using `if __name__ == "__main__":` before creating any Processes.
