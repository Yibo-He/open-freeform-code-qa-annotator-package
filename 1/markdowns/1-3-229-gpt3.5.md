As the title says, how to find and replace text inside a single jupyter cell when using the jupyter extension in Visual Studio Code? I am familiar with ctr+h but that will replace all the occurrences in the entire jupyter notebook file. This is a really important feature for me, as I am using it a lot in jupyter on the browser.
