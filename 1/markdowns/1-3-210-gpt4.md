I was expecting the Python `match`/`case` to have equal time access to each case, but seems like I was wrong. Any good explanation why?
Lets use the following example:
```
def match_case(decimal):
    match decimal:
      case '0':
        return "000"
      case '1':
        return "001"
      case '2':
        return "010"
      case '3':
        return "011"
      case '4':
        return "100"
      case '5':
        return "101"
      case '6':
        return "110"
      case '7':
        return "111"
      case _:
        return "NA"
```

And define a quick tool to measure the time:
```
import time
def measure_time(funcion):
    def measured_function(*args, **kwargs):
        init = time.time()
        c = funcion(*args, **kwargs)
        print(f"Input: {args[1]} Time: {time.time() - init}")
        return c
    return measured_function

@measure_time
def repeat(function, input):
    return [function(input) for i in range(10000000)]
```

If we run each `10000000` times each case, the times are the following:
```
for i in range(8):
    repeat(match_case, str(i))

# Input: 0 Time: 2.458001136779785
# Input: 1 Time: 2.36093807220459
# Input: 2 Time: 2.6832823753356934
# Input: 3 Time: 2.9995620250701904
# Input: 4 Time: 3.5054492950439453
# Input: 5 Time: 3.815168857574463
# Input: 6 Time: 4.164452791213989
# Input: 7 Time: 4.857251167297363
```

Just wondering why the access times are different. Isn't this optimised with perhaps a lookup table?. Note that I'm not interested in other ways of having equals access times (i.e. with dictionaries).

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The Python `match`/`case` structure, introduced in Python 3.10, is not implemented as a hash table or lookup table. Instead, it's implemented as a linear sequence of comparisons, similar to a series of `if`/`elif` statements. This means that the time complexity of a `match` statement is O(n), where n is the number of `case` clauses.

In your example, the `match` statement checks each `case` clause in order, from top to bottom. If the input is '0', it matches the first `case` clause, so the `match` statement completes after one comparison. If the input is '1', it doesn't match the first `case` clause, so the `match` statement checks the second `case` clause, and so on.

This is why the time taken increases with the value of the input: the `match` statement has to check more `case` clauses before it finds a match. For '7', it has to check all the `case` clauses, which takes the longest time.

This behavior is different from some other programming languages, like C or Java, where a `switch` statement is often implemented as a jump table, providing constant-time access to each case. However, Python's `match` statement is more flexible than a `switch` statement, as it can match on different types of patterns, not just constant values. This flexibility comes at the cost of linear time complexity.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The Python `match`/`case` statement, introduced in Python 3.10, is not implemented as a hash table or lookup table, but rather as a sequence of comparisons. This is why the time it takes to match a case increases with the number of preceding cases: each case is checked in order until a match is found.

In your example, the `match` statement checks each `case` in sequence from top to bottom. If the input is '0', it matches the first case and immediately returns. If the input is '1', it checks the first case, finds no match, then checks the second case and returns. This process continues, with each additional case requiring an additional comparison.

This is different from a hash table or lookup table, where access time is constant regardless of the number of entries. In a hash table, the input is used to compute a hash, which directly indexes into the table to find the corresponding value. This operation takes the same amount of time regardless of the size of the table.

The `match`/`case` statement is designed to be more flexible than a hash table. It can match on a variety of conditions, not just equality, and it can bind variables in the process. This flexibility comes at the cost of constant-time access.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `match`/`case` syntax in Python, introduced in Python 3.10, is not implemented as a hash table or lookup table, which would provide constant time access to each case. Instead, it's implemented as a sequence of if-elif-else statements under the hood. This means that each case is checked in the order they are written until a match is found.

In your example, the match for '0' is found immediately, so it's the fastest. The match for '1' is found after one unsuccessful check ('0'), so it's slightly slower. This pattern continues, with each subsequent match taking slightly longer because it has to check more cases before finding a match.

This is different from how switch statements work in some other languages, like C or Java, where the cases are often implemented as a lookup table, providing constant time access to each case. In Python, if you need constant time access, a dictionary would be a more appropriate data structure. But as you mentioned, you're not interested in that approach.

It's also worth noting that the `match`/`case` syntax in Python is more powerful than a simple switch statement or lookup table, because it can match complex patterns, not just simple values. This added flexibility comes with the cost of linear time complexity for finding a match.
