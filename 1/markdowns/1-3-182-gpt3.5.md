I am using the new [multipage feature](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/get-started/multipage-apps) and would like to style my multipage app and put a logo with a title on top of/before the page navigation.
Here's a small example tested on `Python 3.9` with `streamlit==1.11.1` in the following directory structure:
```
/Home.py
/pages/Page_1.py
/pages/Page_2.py
```

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st


st.sidebar.markdown(
    "My Logo (sidebar) should be on top of the Navigation within the sidebar"
)

st.markdown("# Home")
```

`Page_1.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

st.markdown("Page 2")
```

which I can run using:
```
$ streamlit run Home.py
```

But this leads to the Text printed  and not  the navigation:

Is there any way to do this? Any hints are welcome!
Best wishes,

Yes, you can achieve this by using Streamlit's `beta_container` and `beta_columns` functions. Here's an example implementation:

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

# Set page title and favicon
st.set_page_config(page_title="My App", page_icon=":guardsman:")

# Define sidebar logo and title
sidebar_logo = st.sidebar.beta_container()
with sidebar_logo:
    st.image("path/to/logo.png", use_column_width=True)
    st.markdown("# My App")

# Define page navigation
pages = {
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2,
}
page = st.sidebar.radio("Go to", list(pages.keys()))

# Display selected page
pages[page]()
```

`Page_1.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def Page_1():
    st.markdown("## Page 1")
```

`Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def Page_2():
    st.markdown("## Page 2")
```

In this implementation, we use `beta_container` to create a container for the logo and title in the sidebar. We then use `beta_columns` to display the logo and title side-by-side. Finally, we use `set_page_config` to set the page title and favicon.

Note that we import the `Page_1` and `Page_2` functions from their respective files, and call them as functions in the `pages` dictionary. This allows us to easily switch between pages using the `radio` widget in the sidebar.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

Yes, you can achieve this by using Streamlit's `beta_container` and `beta_columns` components. Here's an example implementation:

`Home.py`:
```
import streamlit as st
from pages import Page_1, Page_2

# Define your logo and title
logo = "https://via.placeholder.com/150"
title = "My Streamlit App"

# Create a container for the logo and title
header_container = st.beta_container()
col1, col2 = header_container.beta_columns([1, 3])
with col1:
    st.image(logo, width=100)
with col2:
    st.title(title)

# Create a sidebar with navigation links
st.sidebar.markdown("## Navigation")
pages = {
    "Home": Home,
    "Page 1": Page_1,
    "Page 2": Page_2
}
selection = st.sidebar.radio("", list(pages.keys()))

# Display the selected page
page = pages[selection]
with st.beta_container():
    page.app()
```

`Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py`:
```
import streamlit as st

def app():
    st.markdown("## Page 1")
```

Note that we've defined a `app()` function in each page file, which is called in the `Home.py` file to display the selected page.

With this implementation, the logo and title will be displayed on top of the navigation links in the sidebar. You can customize the logo and title by changing the `logo` and `title` variables in the `Home.py` file.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can achieve this by using the `beta_container` and `beta_columns` components in Streamlit. Here's an example of how you can modify your `Home.py` file to achieve the desired layout:

```
import streamlit as st

# Set page title and favicon
st.set_page_config(page_title="My Multipage App", page_icon=":guardsman:")

# Define the logo and title
logo = ":guardsman:"
title = "My Multipage App"

# Create a container for the logo and title
header = st.beta_container()
col1, col2 = header.beta_columns([1, 3])

# Add the logo and title to the container
with col1:
    st.write(logo)
with col2:
    st.write(f"# {title}")

# Create the navigation menu
menu = ["Home", "Page 1", "Page 2"]
choice = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a page", menu)

# Show the appropriate page based on the user's choice
if choice == "Home":
    st.write("You are on the Home page")
else:
    # Import the appropriate page module
    if choice == "Page 1":
        import pages.Page_1 as page
    elif choice == "Page 2":
        import pages.Page_2 as page

    # Show the page
    page.show()
```

In this modified version of `Home.py`, we first set the page title and favicon using the `set_page_config` function. Then, we define the logo and title and create a container using the `beta_container` component. Within the container, we create two columns using the `beta_columns` component, with the first column containing the logo and the second column containing the title. We then create the navigation menu using the `selectbox` function and show the appropriate page based on the user's choice. Finally, we import the appropriate page module and call its `show` function to display the page content.

Note that we've added a `show` function to each of the page modules (`Page_1.py` and `Page_2.py`) to make it easier to display the page content. Here's an example of what `Page_1.py` could look like:

```
import streamlit as st

def show():
    st.write("You are on Page 1")
```

With these modifications, you should be able to achieve the desired layout for your multipage app. Let me know if you have any questions!
