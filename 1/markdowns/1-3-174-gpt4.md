I installed psycopg2 using conda on Windows 10.
[https://anaconda.org/anaconda/psycopg2](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/psycopg2)
I did it in a clean new conda environment (named wr).
I then tried to run this sample app but I am getting this error (see below).
I have no idea what I might be doing wrong because it was all straightforward and I did it in a clean way.
Any ideas how to solve this?
```
import psycopg2
try:
    connection = psycopg2.connect(user = "***",
                                  password = "***",
                                  host = "***",
                                  port = "5432",
                                  database = "***")


    cursor = connection.cursor()
    # Print PostgreSQL Connection properties
    print ( connection.get_dsn_parameters(),"\n")

    # Print PostgreSQL version
    cursor.execute("SELECT version();")
    record = cursor.fetchone()
    print("You are connected to - ", record,"\n")

except (Exception, psycopg2.Error) as error :
    print ("Error while connecting to PostgreSQL", error)
finally:
    #closing database connection.
        if(connection):
            cursor.close()
            connection.close()
            print("PostgreSQL connection is closed")
```

: Seems they had a bug open for this 2 years ago and they just closed it, ignoring it completely.

The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that there is a problem with the psycopg2 binary package you installed. It seems like the binary package is not compatible with your system.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Try using psycopg2-binary**: The psycopg2-binary package is a stand-alone package that includes its own Python and PostgreSQL library dependencies. It is easier to install but not suitable for production. To install it, you can use pip:

    ```
    pip install psycopg2-binary
    ```

2. **Check your Python version**: Make sure you are using a Python version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install.

3. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure you are using a PostgreSQL version that is compatible with the psycopg2 version you are trying to install.

4. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Uninstall the current psycopg2 package and then reinstall it. Sometimes, this can fix the problem.

    ```
    pip uninstall psycopg2
    pip install psycopg2
    ```

5. **Install psycopg2 from source**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try installing psycopg2 from source. This requires a C compiler and the PostgreSQL headers.

    ```
    pip install psycopg2 --no-binary :all:
    ```

Remember to replace `pip` with `conda` if you are using Anaconda. Also, make sure to activate your conda environment before installing the package.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` indicates that there is a problem with loading the psycopg2 DLL. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a missing or incompatible library.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Python version**: Make sure that the Python version you are using is compatible with the psycopg2 version you have installed. If you're using Python 3.8 or later, you might want to try installing psycopg2-binary instead of psycopg2. You can do this with the command `pip install psycopg2-binary`.

2. **Check your PostgreSQL version**: Make sure that the PostgreSQL version you are using is compatible with the psycopg2 version you have installed.

3. **Reinstall psycopg2**: Sometimes, reinstalling the package can solve the problem. You can uninstall the package with the command `pip uninstall psycopg2` and then reinstall it with the command `pip install psycopg2`.

4. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the PostgreSQL bin directory is in your PATH. You can do this by opening a command prompt and typing `echo %PATH%`. If the PostgreSQL bin directory is not in the PATH, you can add it by modifying the system environment variables.

5. **Try a different installation method**: If installing psycopg2 with conda doesn't work, you might want to try installing it with pip instead.

6. **Check for conflicting packages**: If you have other packages installed that also use PostgreSQL, they might be causing a conflict. Try uninstalling these packages to see if that resolves the issue.

Remember to replace `pip` with `conda` if you are using Anaconda.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing _psycopg: The operating system cannot run %1.` suggests that there's a problem with the psycopg2 library that you've installed. It seems like the library is not compatible with your system or there's a missing dependency.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Reinstall psycopg2-binary**: The psycopg2-binary package is a stand-alone package that includes its own Python and PostgreSQL library dependencies. It's easier to install and doesn't require a compiler or external libraries. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip uninstall psycopg2
   pip install psycopg2-binary
   ```

2. **Install the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable**: psycopg2 requires the Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable package. If it's not installed on your system, you might get a DLL load failed error. You can download it from the [Microsoft website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=48145).

3. **Check your Python and psycopg2 versions**: Make sure that your Python version is compatible with the psycopg2 version you're trying to install. If you're using a 64-bit version of Python, you should install the 64-bit version of psycopg2, and vice versa.

4. **Check your PATH**: Make sure that the Python and PostgreSQL directories are in your system's PATH. If they're not, Python might not be able to find the necessary DLLs.

5. **Try using a different Python environment**: If you're using Anaconda, try creating a new environment and installing psycopg2 there. If you're not using Anaconda, try installing it and using an Anaconda environment.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more information about your system (Python version, psycopg2 version, etc.) so I can give you more specific advice.
