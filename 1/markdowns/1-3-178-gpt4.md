This is a followup to this [question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64303326/using-playwright-for-python-how-do-i-select-or-find-an-element) on the basic functionality of Playwright for Python.
How do I  an  from a ?
This example remote controls a vuejs-webseite that has a drop down list of fruits like "Apple", "Banana", "Carrot", "Orange"
Here I want to select the option "Banana"
```
from playwright import sync_playwright
import time

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)
    handle = page.querySelector(new_selector)

    # at this point I have the element and can print the content
    print(handle.innerHTML())
```

The drop down list HTML like this
```
<select data-v-c2cef47a="" id="name-fruit" autocomplete="true" class="form-select__select">
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" disabled="disabled" value=""><!----></option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Apple </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Banana </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Carrot </option>
    <option data-v-c2cef47a="" value="[object Object]"> Orange </option> 
</select>
```

in Selenium, I would select an option like this
```
from selenium.webdriver.support.ui import Select
Select(handle).select_by_visible_text('Banana')  # Note: no spaces needed!
```

The Javascript docs for Playwright have this, which is not exactly the same, because it seems to identify the object at the same time.
```
// Single selection matching the label
await page.selectOption('select#colors', { label: 'Blue' });
```

How do I do the selection in Playwright for Python?
I tried both of these and nothing happens.
```
handle.selectOption("text=Banana") 
handle.selectOption("text= Banana ")
```

In Playwright for Python, you can select an option from a dropdown using the `select_option` method. This method can take a value, an index, or a label to select the option.

In your case, you can select the option "Banana" by its visible text like this:

```python
page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")
```

Here is the complete code:

```python
from playwright import sync_playwright
import time

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)

    # select the option "Banana" by its visible text
    page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")

    # at this point I have the element and can print the content
    handle = page.querySelector(new_selector)
    print(handle.innerHTML())
```

Please note that the `select_option` method is called on the `page` object, not on the `handle` object. The `new_selector` is passed as the first argument to identify the dropdown list, and the `label` parameter is used to specify the visible text of the option to be selected.

In Playwright for Python, you can select an option from a dropdown using the `select_option` method. This method allows you to select an option by its value, label, or index.

In your case, since you want to select the option "Banana" by its visible text, you can use the `label` option. Here is how you can do it:

```python
from playwright import sync_playwright

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)

    # select the option "Banana" from the dropdown
    page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")
```

Note that the `select_option` method is called on the `page` object, not on the element handle. The first argument is the selector of the dropdown element, and the second argument is the option to select.

Also, make sure that the label matches the visible text of the option exactly, including any leading or trailing spaces. In your HTML, the option text "Banana" has leading and trailing spaces, so you need to include these spaces in the label:

```python
page.select_option(new_selector, label=" Banana ")
```

If the option text does not have any leading or trailing spaces, you can remove the spaces from the label:

```python
page.select_option(new_selector, label="Banana")
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In Playwright for Python, you can select an option from a dropdown list by using the `select_option` method. You can specify the option by its value, label or index. In your case, you want to select by visible text which corresponds to the label.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
from playwright import sync_playwright

URL = '<my url>'

with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.newPage()
    page.goto(URL)

    # identify this element by ID. Wait for it first
    new_selector = 'id=name-fruit'
    page.waitForSelector(new_selector)

    # select the option
    page.selectOption(new_selector, label='Banana')
```

In the above code, we are using the `selectOption` method on the page object. The first argument is the selector for the dropdown list and the second argument is the option to be selected. We are using the `label` keyword argument to specify the option by its visible text.

Please note that the `selectOption` method is case-sensitive and it also considers leading and trailing whitespaces. So make sure that the label matches exactly with the visible text of the option.

Also, the `selectOption` method will wait for the element to be present in the DOM, visible, and stable before performing the action. So, you don't need to use `waitForSelector` before `selectOption` unless you have a specific reason to do so.
