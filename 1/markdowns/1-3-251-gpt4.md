I have been trying to run `pip3 install mariadb` on my raspberry pi running ubuntu 18.04 and I was unsuccessful.
I have tried installing following packages as suggested in other answers:
```
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev
sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

pip3 install mysqlclient
pip3 install mysql-connector-python-rf
```

However, I'm still running intto the problem as shown:
```
ubuntu@ubuntu:~$ pip3 install mariadb

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that the `mariadb_config` utility is not found. This utility is part of the MariaDB Connector/C package, which is a client library for C development.

You can install it by running the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev
```

This package should provide the `mariadb_config` utility needed for the `pip3 install mariadb` command to work.

After installing `libmariadb-dev`, try running `pip3 install mariadb` again.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message indicates that the `mariadb_config` utility is not found. This utility is provided by the `libmariadb-dev` package. You can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadb-dev
```

After installing `libmariadb-dev`, you should be able to install the `mariadb` Python package using `pip3`:

```bash
pip3 install mariadb
```

If you still encounter issues, it's possible that the `mariadb_config` utility is not in your `PATH`. You can find its location using the `find` command:

```bash
sudo find / -name "mariadb_config"
```

If the utility is located in a directory that's not in your `PATH`, you can add it to your `PATH` using the `export` command. For example, if `mariadb_config` is located in `/usr/local/mariadb/bin`, you would use the following command:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/mariadb/bin
```

You can add this line to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file to make this change permanent. After updating your `PATH`, try installing the `mariadb` Python package again.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that the `mariadb_config` utility could not be found. This utility is part of the MariaDB Connector/C package, which is a client library for C development.

To fix this issue, you need to install the MariaDB Connector/C package. On Ubuntu, you can install it using the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libmariadbclient-dev-compat
```

This package provides the `mariadb_config` utility which is required by the `pip3 install mariadb` command.

After installing the package, try running the `pip3 install mariadb` command again. It should now complete without errors.
