i have two files, and i want to run both. The first one is basically asking down the prices of stocks and writes them to a database, and the second one using python dash to create a webpage. This webpage is showing the data in real time from the database which is constantly refreshes. I tried to use threading but it does not work, because the two files basically function as two infinite while loop. How should i solve this problem?
The two functions im having problem with are
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)
and
if  == "":
app.run_server(debug=True)
```
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
database=db.dataBase()
homepage=hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
dataMiningScript= fd.financeData(database,1600)

app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()



if __name__ == "__main__":
   app.run_server(debug=True)
```

One solution to this problem is to combine the two scripts into one file and run them in the same thread. You can use the `schedule` module to schedule the data mining script to run at regular intervals and update the database. Then, you can use the `Dash` framework to create the webpage and display the data from the database in real-time.

Here's an example of how you can combine the two scripts:

```python
import schedule
import time
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import finance_data as fd
import home_page as hp
import data_base as db

# Initialize the database
database = db.dataBase()

# Define the data mining function
def data_mining():
    dataMiningScript = fd.financeData(database, 1600)
    # Schedule the function to run every 5 minutes
    schedule.every(5).minutes.do(data_mining)

# Define the Dash app
app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
homepage = hp.homepage(database)
homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)

# Define the layout
app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

# Define the update function
def update():
    homepage.updateData(database)
    time.sleep(1)

# Run the app
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Schedule the data mining function to run every 5 minutes
    schedule.every(5).minutes.do(data_mining)
    # Run the app
    while True:
        update()
        app.run_server(debug=True)
        schedule.run_pending()
```

In this example, the `data_mining` function is scheduled to run every 5 minutes using the `schedule` module. The `update` function is called in an infinite loop to update the data in the database and run the Dash app. The `schedule.run_pending()` function is used to check if there are any scheduled tasks that need to be run.

Note that you may need to modify the `update` function to update the data in the database based on the data mining script. You may also need to modify the `homepage.updateData` function to retrieve the data from the database and update the webpage.

One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which can be useful when you have two infinite loops that need to run simultaneously.

Here's an example of how you can use multiprocessing to run both scripts simultaneously:

```
import multiprocessing
import financeData as fd
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import homePage as hp
import dataBase as db

if __name__ == '__main__':
    # Create a new process for the data mining script
    data_mining_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=fd.financeData, args=(db.dataBase(), 1600))
    data_mining_process.start()

    # Run the dash app in the main process
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    database = db.dataBase()
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()
    app.run_server(debug=True)

    # Wait for the data mining process to finish
    data_mining_process.join()
```

In this example, we create a new process for the data mining script using the `multiprocessing.Process` class. We pass the `target` argument as the `financeData` function and the `args` argument as a tuple containing the database and the refresh rate.

We then start the data mining process using the `start` method.

In the main process, we run the dash app as usual. Once the app is running, we wait for the data mining process to finish using the `join` method.

This way, both scripts can run simultaneously without interfering with each other.

One solution to this problem is to use multiprocessing instead of threading. Multiprocessing allows you to run multiple processes simultaneously, which is useful when you have two infinite loops that need to run concurrently.

Here's an example of how you can use multiprocessing to run both scripts simultaneously:

```python
import multiprocessing
import financeData as fd
import dash
import dash_bootstrap_components as dbc
import dataBase as db
import homepage as hp

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a database object
    database = db.dataBase()

    # Create a financeData object to continuously update the database
    data_mining_process = multiprocessing.Process(target=fd.financeData, args=(database, 1600))
    data_mining_process.start()

    # Create a Dash app to display the data from the database
    app = dash.Dash(__name__, external_stylesheets=[dbc.themes.BOOTSTRAP])
    homepage = hp.homepage(database)
    homepage.timeUpdateCallback(app)
    homepage.gaugeRefreshCallback(app)
    app.layout = homepage.layoutMaker()

    # Run the Dash app
    app.run_server(debug=True)

    # Terminate the financeData process when the Dash app is closed
    data_mining_process.terminate()
```

In this example, we create a `multiprocessing.Process` object for the `financeData` function and start it running in the background. Then we create the Dash app and run it as usual. Finally, we terminate the `financeData` process when the Dash app is closed.

Note that you may need to modify the `financeData` function to make it work with multiprocessing. For example, you may need to use a `multiprocessing.Queue` to communicate between the two processes.
