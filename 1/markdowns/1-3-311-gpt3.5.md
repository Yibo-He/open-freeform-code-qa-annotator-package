I have a dataframe with 14 rows Ã— 1500 columns which contains only Numerical values. I want to apply a simple condition that if any values in the entire dataframe is above a certain number, say 25, then replace those values with 1 else replace with 0. I have found some solution on where I can perform such operation but I have specify the column name but I couldn't find any solution where I can perform one condition on the entire dataframe.
```
df[0.0] = df[0.0].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

This works for a specific column but
```
df = df[:,:].apply(lambda x: 1 if x >=25 else 0)
```

doesn't work. Could someone help?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can use the `applymap` method to apply a function to each element of the dataframe. Here's how you can modify your code to apply the condition to the entire dataframe:

```
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will replace all values greater than or equal to 25 with 1, and all other values with 0.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the `applymap()` method to apply a function to every element of the dataframe. Here's an example code snippet that should achieve what you're looking for:

```
df = df.applymap(lambda x: 1 if x >= 25 else 0)
```

This will apply the lambda function to every element of the dataframe, replacing values greater than or equal to 25 with 1 and all other values with 0.
