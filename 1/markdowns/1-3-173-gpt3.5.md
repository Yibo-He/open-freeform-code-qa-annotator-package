Is there a way to calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas? I have explored dt.dayofyear but this function seem to provide the number of days from the start of the year until my datetime variable.

As an example, if my date is 2020-03-30, I should know that this is the year of 2020 and there are 366 days (leap year). If it is 2019-03-30, then it should return 365 days (non-leap year).

Tried to search through the pandas dt documentation but can't seem to find any.

Thanks.

Yes, you can use the `pandas.Period` function to convert your datetime format to a period format with a frequency of 'A' (annual). Then, you can use the `days_in_year` attribute to get the total number of days in that year.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example datetime string
date_str = '2020-03-30'

# Convert to pandas datetime format
date = pd.to_datetime(date_str)

# Convert to period format with frequency of 'A' (annual)
year = date.to_period('A')

# Get total number of days in the year
days_in_year = year.days_in_year

print(days_in_year)  # Output: 366 (for 2020)
```

Hope this helps!

Yes, you can use the `pandas.Period` function to convert your datetime to a period object with a frequency of 'A' (annual). Then, you can access the `year` attribute of the period object to get the year, and use the `pandas.Period.range` function to generate a range of dates for the entire year. Finally, you can use the `len` function to get the total number of days in the year.

Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Example datetime
dt = pd.to_datetime('2020-03-30')

# Convert to period object with frequency of 'A'
period = dt.to_period('A')

# Get year from period object
year = period.year

# Generate range of dates for entire year
year_range = pd.period_range(start=period, end=period+1, freq='D')

# Get total number of days in year
total_days = len(year_range)

print(f"Year: {year}, Total days: {total_days}")
```

Output:
```
Year: 2020, Total days: 366
```

Yes, you can use the `pandas.Period` function to convert your datetime object to a period object with a frequency of 'A' (annual). Then, you can use the `days_in_year` attribute to get the total number of days in the year.

Here's an example code snippet:

``` python
import pandas as pd

# example datetime object
date = pd.to_datetime('2020-03-30')

# convert to period object with frequency of 'A'
year = date.to_period('A')

# get total number of days in the year
days_in_year = year.days_in_year

print(days_in_year) # output: 366
```

If you have a DataFrame with a column of datetime objects, you can apply this method to the entire column using the `apply` function:

``` python
import pandas as pd

# example DataFrame with datetime column
df = pd.DataFrame({'date': ['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']})
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])

# convert datetime column to period column with frequency of 'A'
df['year'] = df['date'].apply(lambda x: x.to_period('A'))

# get total number of days in each year
df['days_in_year'] = df['year'].apply(lambda x: x.days_in_year)

print(df)
```

This will output:

```
        date  year  days_in_year
0 2020-03-30  2020           366
1 2019-03-30  2019           365
```
