The error message `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'` is indicating that Python cannot find the module named 'app'. This is likely because the Dockerfile is not correctly copying the app directory into the Docker image.

In your Dockerfile, you have specified `COPY ./app /app` which means you are copying the contents of your local `app` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker image. However, the error message suggests that Python is not able to find the `app` module, which means the `app` directory might not be correctly copied.

Here's how you can modify your Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app 

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --requirement requirements.txt

COPY ./app .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

In this Dockerfile:

- `COPY requirements.txt .` copies the `requirements.txt` file to the working directory in the Docker image.
- `RUN pip install --requirement requirements.txt` installs the Python dependencies.
- `COPY ./app .` copies the contents of the local `app` directory to the working directory in the Docker image.
- `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]` starts the FastAPI application.

Please make sure that your `main.py` file is inside the `app` directory and `app` is specified in your `main.py` file as `app = FastAPI()`. If your `main.py` is in the root directory, then you should copy it separately using `COPY ./main.py .` and change the CMD to `CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]`.

The error you're seeing is likely due to the structure of your project or the way you're referencing your files in the Dockerfile. 

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Make sure your project structure is as follows:

```
fastapi/
    app/
        main.py
        language_detector.py
    Dockerfile
    docker-compose.yml
    requirements.txt
```

2. Update your Dockerfile to reflect the correct structure:

```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR /app 

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --requirement requirements.txt

COPY ./app .

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

This Dockerfile starts with a Python 3.8 image, sets the working directory to /app, copies your requirements.txt file into the Docker image and installs the Python dependencies, then copies your app directory into the Docker image. It exposes port 8000 and finally runs your FastAPI application using uvicorn.

Remember to build your Docker image from the directory containing the Dockerfile. If you're in the same directory as the Dockerfile, you can build the image using:

```bash
docker build -t myimage .
```

And then run it with:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 myimage
```

This will make your application available at http://localhost:8000.

The error message "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'app'" means that Python can't find the module 'app' in the directories it's looking in. This error is usually due to a problem with the Python path or the location of your files.

In your Dockerfile, you are copying the contents of your local `app` directory to the `/app` directory in the Docker image:

```dockerfile
COPY ./app /app
```

Then, you are trying to run the command `uvicorn app.main:app`:

```dockerfile
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

This command is looking for a Python module named `app` in the current working directory, which is `/app` in the Docker image. But if your `app` directory doesn't contain an `__init__.py` file, Python won't recognize it as a package, and you'll get a `ModuleNotFoundError`.

To fix this issue, you can try one of the following solutions:

1. Add an `__init__.py` file to your `app` directory if it doesn't already have one. This file can be empty; its presence tells Python to treat the directory as a package.

2. Change your `WORKDIR` to `/` and adjust the `COPY` and `CMD` commands accordingly:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8
WORKDIR / 

COPY requirements.txt /
RUN pip install --requirement /requirements.txt

COPY ./app /app

EXPOSE 8000
CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

3. If your `main.py` file is in the root directory and not in the `app` directory, adjust the `CMD` command to point to the correct location:

```dockerfile
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host=0.0.0.0" , "--reload" , "--port", "8000"]
```

Remember to rebuild your Docker image after making these changes.
