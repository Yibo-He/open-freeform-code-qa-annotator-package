I would like a way to integrate django with mqtt and for that the first thing that came in my mind was using django-channels and an mqtt broker that supports mqtt over web sockets, so I could communicate directly between the broker and django-channels.
However, I did not found a way to start a websocket client from django, and acording to this [link](https://forum.djangoproject.com/t/add-a-websocket-client-to-django-not-a-server/2916/8) it's not possible.
Since I'm also starting to study task queues I wonder if it would be a good practice to start an mqtt client using paho-mqtt and then run that in a separate process using celery. This process would then forward the messages receives by the broker to django channels through websockets, this way I could also communicate with the client process, to publish data or stop the mqtt client when needed, and all that directly from django.
I'm a little skeptical about this idea since I also read that process run in celery should not take too long to complete, and in this case that's exactly what I want to do.
So my question is, how much of a bad idea that is? Is there any other option to directly integrate django with mqtt?

Your idea of using Celery to run a separate process for the MQTT client is not necessarily a bad one, but as you mentioned, it's not the best practice to use Celery for long-running tasks. Celery is designed for short, asynchronous tasks and it's not ideal for tasks that need to maintain a persistent connection like an MQTT client.

However, there are other ways to integrate Django with MQTT:

1. **Use a separate service**: Instead of trying to run the MQTT client within Django or Celery, you could run it as a separate service. This service would handle all MQTT communication and could use Django's REST API or database to communicate with your Django app. This would allow you to keep the MQTT client running as long as you need without interfering with your Django app or Celery tasks.

2. **Use Django Channels**: Django Channels is designed to handle WebSocket communication, which is similar to MQTT. You could use Django Channels to handle MQTT messages, but you would need to implement the MQTT protocol yourself or find a library that can handle it.

3. **Use a MQTT to HTTP bridge**: Some MQTT brokers offer a HTTP bridge, which allows you to send and receive MQTT messages over HTTP. This would allow you to use Django's built-in HTTP capabilities to handle MQTT messages.

4. **Use a third-party service**: There are several third-party services that offer MQTT integration, such as CloudMQTT. These services handle all the MQTT communication for you and provide a HTTP API that you can use with Django.

In conclusion, while it's possible to use Celery for your MQTT client, it's probably not the best solution. A separate service or a third-party MQTT service would likely be a better fit.

Your idea of using Celery to run a separate process for the MQTT client is not a bad one, but it does come with some caveats. As you mentioned, Celery tasks are generally designed to be short-lived and not to run indefinitely. However, you can use a long-running task in Celery, but you need to be careful about how you manage it.

You could use a Celery task to start the MQTT client and then use Django Channels to communicate between the client and your Django application. This would allow you to send messages from Django to the MQTT client and vice versa. However, you would need to ensure that the Celery task is properly managed and restarted if it crashes or is terminated for any reason.

Another option would be to use a separate service to run the MQTT client. This service could be a simple Python script that uses the Paho MQTT client to connect to the broker and then communicates with Django via a REST API or some other method. This would allow you to keep the MQTT client running independently of Django and Celery, and you could use a process manager like Supervisor or systemd to ensure that the service is always running.

In terms of integrating Django with MQTT directly, there are not many options available. Django is primarily a web framework and does not have built-in support for MQTT. You could potentially use a library like hbmqtt, which is an MQTT client written in Python, but this would still require running a separate service or process to handle the MQTT client.

In conclusion, while your idea is not a bad one, it does require careful management of the Celery task. A separate service for the MQTT client may be a more robust solution.

Your idea of using Celery to run a separate process for the MQTT client is not necessarily a bad one, but it does come with some potential issues. As you mentioned, Celery tasks are generally designed to be short-lived and not to run indefinitely. This could lead to problems if you're trying to maintain a persistent MQTT connection.

However, you could potentially work around this by having the Celery task periodically check if it should continue running and terminate itself if not. You could also use a heartbeat mechanism to ensure the task is still running and restart it if necessary.

Another potential issue is that Celery tasks are typically run in a separate process or even a separate machine, which could complicate communication between the task and your Django application. You would need to use a mechanism like Django Channels or a message queue to communicate between them.

An alternative approach could be to use a separate service to handle the MQTT communication. This service could be written in any language and would communicate with your Django application via HTTP or a message queue. This would allow you to use an MQTT library that is designed for long-lived connections and wouldn't require you to work around the limitations of Celery tasks.

In conclusion, while your idea is not necessarily a bad one, it does come with some potential complications. Depending on your specific needs and constraints, a separate service for MQTT communication might be a simpler and more robust solution.
