Python 2.7 is reaching its end of life on 1st Jan, 2020 as mentioned by 

[https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/](https://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/)

[https://pythonclock.org/](https://pythonclock.org/)

Will current `pip` keep on working for python 2.7 after that date? It is already showing the msg for deprecation of python 2.7. Will we be able to run
`pip install abc==1.2.3` after that date?

We do understand that after EOL, no new fixes/support will be done for 2.7, so that is not the concern here. 

The question stems from the desire to keep running on python 2.7 even after EOL.

Yes, pip will continue to work with Python 2.7 after its end of life. The Python Package Index (PyPI) will not be removing any Python 2.7 packages, so you will still be able to download and install them with pip. However, individual package maintainers may choose to stop supporting Python 2.7, so new versions of packages may not be compatible with Python 2.7.

It's important to note that while pip will continue to work with Python 2.7, it will not receive any updates or bug fixes for Python 2.7. The version of pip that is available at the end of life of Python 2.7 will be the final version for Python 2.7.

While you can continue to use Python 2.7, it is strongly recommended to upgrade to Python 3 as soon as possible. Python 2.7 will not receive any security updates after its end of life, which can put your applications at risk.

Yes, `pip` will continue to work with Python 2.7 after its end of life. You will still be able to install packages for Python 2.7 using `pip install abc==1.2.3`. 

However, it's important to note that while `pip` will continue to work, many package maintainers will stop supporting Python 2.7. This means that over time, you may find that newer versions of packages are not compatible with Python 2.7. 

Also, the Python Package Index (PyPI) will continue to serve Python 2 packages, but there's no guarantee for how long. 

In general, while it's technically possible to continue using Python 2.7 after its end of life, it's strongly recommended to upgrade to Python 3 to benefit from its improvements and to receive ongoing support and updates.

Yes, `pip` will continue to work for Python 2.7 even after its end of life. You will still be able to install packages using `pip install abc==1.2.3`. However, it's important to note that while `pip` will continue to work, individual package maintainers may choose to stop supporting Python 2.7. This means that newer versions of packages may not be compatible with Python 2.7.

Also, the Python Package Index (PyPI) will continue to serve Python 2 packages. The Python Software Foundation has not announced any plans to stop hosting Python 2.7 packages on PyPI.

However, it's strongly recommended to upgrade to Python 3 as soon as possible, as Python 2.7 will not receive any security updates or bug fixes, making any code running on it potentially vulnerable.
