I ordered a MacBook Pro equipped with an M1 ARM processor. Will I be able to run [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and install dev tools like Python, Node etc..?

Yes, you can definitely run Homebrew on your MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has already released a version that is compatible with the M1 chip. You can install it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

Once Homebrew is installed, you can use it to install various development tools such as Python, Node.js, and other packages. However, not all packages may be compatible with the M1 chip yet, so you may need to check the compatibility of each package before installing it.

Yes, you can run Homebrew on your MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has been updated to support the new architecture, and many popular dev tools like Python and Node have also been updated to run on the M1 processor. However, not all packages may be available yet, so you may need to check the compatibility of specific packages before installing them. Additionally, some packages may require additional steps to install or may not work as expected on the new architecture. It's always a good idea to check the documentation for each package before installing it on your M1 MacBook Pro.
