How do you check if a package is at its latest version programmatically in a script and return a true or false?

I can check with a script like this:

```
package='gekko'
import pip
if hasattr(pip, 'main'):
    from pip import main as pipmain
else:
    from pip._internal import main as pipmain
pipmain(['search','gekko'])
```


or with command line: 

```
(base) C:\User>pip search gekko
gekko (0.2.3)  - Machine learning and optimization for dynamic systems
  INSTALLED: 0.2.3 (latest)
```


But how do I check programmatically and return true or false?

You can use the `pip show` command to get the installed version of a package, and `pip search` to get the latest version available. Then, you can compare these two versions to check if the package is up-to-date. 

Here is a Python script that does this:

```python
import subprocess
import re

def is_package_up_to_date(package_name):
    # Get installed version
    installed_package = subprocess.getoutput('pip show ' + package_name)
    installed_version = re.search('Version: (.*)', installed_package)
    if installed_version is None:
        return False
    installed_version = installed_version.group(1)

    # Get latest version
    latest_package = subprocess.getoutput('pip search ' + package_name)
    latest_version = re.search(package_name + ' \((.*)\)', latest_package)
    if latest_version is None:
        return False
    latest_version = latest_version.group(1)

    # Compare versions
    return installed_version == latest_version

print(is_package_up_to_date('gekko'))
```

This script will return `True` if the package is up-to-date, and `False` otherwise. 

Please note that this script assumes that `pip` is in your system's PATH. If it's not, you might need to replace `'pip show '` and `'pip search '` with the full path to your `pip` executable.

Also, please note that the `pip search` command is currently disabled due to PyPI's XMLRPC API removal. You might need to use an alternative method to get the latest version of a package. For example, you can use the `requests` library to send a GET request to `https://pypi.org/pypi/<package_name>/json` and parse the JSON response to get the latest version.

You can use the `pip show` command to get the current version of a package installed, and then use the `pip search` command to get the latest version available. Then you can compare these two versions to see if the package is up-to-date. Here's a Python script that does this:

```python
import pip
import re
import subprocess

def is_package_up_to_date(package):
    # Get installed version
    installed_package = subprocess.getoutput('pip show {}'.format(package))
    installed_version = re.search('Version: (.*)', installed_package).group(1)

    # Get latest version
    available_package = subprocess.getoutput('pip search {}'.format(package))
    latest_version = re.search('{} \((.*)\)'.format(package), available_package).group(1)

    # Compare versions
    return installed_version == latest_version

package='gekko'
print(is_package_up_to_date(package))
```

This script will return `True` if the package is up-to-date and `False` otherwise.

Note: This script assumes that the `pip search` command returns the latest version in the format `package (version)`. If the format is different, you may need to adjust the regular expression used to extract the version.

Also, please note that the `pip search` command is currently disabled due to PyPI / pip issues. You may need to use an alternative method to get the latest version of a package, such as scraping the package's PyPI page or using an API like the Libraries.io API for Python.

You can use the `pip show` command to get the current version of a package, and the `pip search` command to get the latest version. Then, you can compare these two versions to see if they match. Here's a Python script that does this:

```python
import subprocess
import re

def is_latest_version(package):
    # Get the current version
    current_version = subprocess.getoutput(f'pip show {package}').split('\n')
    current_version = [line for line in current_version if 'Version' in line][0]
    current_version = re.search(r'Version: (.*)', current_version).group(1)

    # Get the latest version
    latest_version = subprocess.getoutput(f'pip search {package}').split('\n')
    latest_version = [line for line in latest_version if package in line][0]
    latest_version = re.search(r'\((.*)\)', latest_version).group(1)

    # Compare the versions
    return current_version == latest_version

print(is_latest_version('gekko'))  # Replace 'gekko' with your package
```

This script will return `True` if the package is at its latest version, and `False` otherwise.

Please note that this script might not work if the output of `pip show` or `pip search` is not in English or if the format changes in future versions of pip. Also, it assumes that the package name appears only once in the output of `pip search`, which might not be the case for all packages.

Also, note that `pip search` is currently disabled due to PyPI/Warehouse issue #824, so this script will not work until that issue is resolved. As an alternative, you might want to use an API like the PyPI JSON API to get the latest version of a package.
