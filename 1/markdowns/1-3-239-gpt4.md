How can I install a previous version of Python 3 in macOS using brew?

With the command `brew install python` I got the latest version of Python 3 (currently v3.7.0), but I want the last version of Python 3.6 (currently 3.6.5).

I have read about another package `pyenv` that can assist in handle different python installation, but this solution is not suitable for me.

To install a specific version of Python using Homebrew, you can use the following steps:

1. First, you need to update Homebrew. Open Terminal and type:

```bash
brew update
```

2. Next, search for the available Python versions:

```bash
brew search python
```

This will list all the available Python versions. Look for the version you want to install.

3. Once you find the version you want to install, use the following command to install it:

```bash
brew install python@3.6
```

This will install Python 3.6 on your macOS.

4. After the installation, you need to add the Python 3.6 executable to your PATH. You can do this by adding the following line to your `.bash_profile` or `.zshrc` file:

```bash
export PATH="/usr/local/opt/python@3.6/bin:$PATH"
```

5. Finally, you can verify the Python version by typing:

```bash
python3 --version
```

This should display the version of Python you just installed.

Please note that Homebrew does not always maintain older versions of packages, so the specific version you're looking for may not be available. In such cases, you might have to consider using other version management tools like `pyenv`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Homebrew does not provide a way to install older versions of Python. However, you can install an older version of Python using pyenv, which is a simple, powerful and cross-platform tool for managing multiple Python versions.

Here's how you can install Python 3.6.5 using pyenv:

1. First, install pyenv using Homebrew:

```bash
brew install pyenv
```

2. Add pyenv init to your shell to enable shims and autocompletion:

```bash
echo 'if which pyenv > /dev/null; then eval "$(pyenv init -)"; fi' >> ~/.bash_profile
source ~/.bash_profile
```

3. Install Python 3.6.5:

```bash
pyenv install 3.6.5
```

4. Set the global Python version to 3.6.5:

```bash
pyenv global 3.6.5
```

5. Verify that Python 3.6.5 is being used:

```bash
python --version
```

This should output "Python 3.6.5".

If you don't want to use pyenv, you can download Python 3.6.5 directly from the Python website and install it manually. However, this might require more work to set up properly, especially if you want to switch between different Python versions.

Homebrew does not provide options to install previous versions of packages directly. However, you can install a specific version of Python using Homebrew with a little workaround.

Here's how you can do it:

1. Tap into the Homebrew versions by running the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    brew tap-new local/old-python
    ```

2. Create a new formula for the Python version you want. For example, for Python 3.6.5:

    ```bash
    brew extract --version=3.6.5 python local/old-python
    ```

3. Now you can install Python 3.6.5 with:

    ```bash
    brew install local/old-python/python@3.6.5
    ```

Please note that this is not the recommended way to manage multiple versions of Python on your system. Tools like `pyenv` are designed specifically for this purpose and are generally more reliable and easier to use.
