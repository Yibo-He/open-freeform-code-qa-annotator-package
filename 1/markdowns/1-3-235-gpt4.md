I have a dataframe with a column named `year` in object format. I want to convert object to int but I have this error :
> ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: '2021.0'
Here is my code :
`data_h_df['year'].astype(str).astype(int)`

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error is because there are some float values in your 'year' column and you're trying to convert them directly to int. The float values have a decimal part which cannot be converted to int directly.

You can first convert the column to float and then to int. Here is how you can do it:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
```

This will first convert the 'year' column to float, which will handle the '2021.0' like strings. Then it will convert the float values to int.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error is because the value '2021.0' is a string representation of a float, not an integer. When you try to convert it to an integer, Python raises a ValueError because it's not a valid integer string.

You should first convert the strings to floats, then convert the floats to integers. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
```

This code first converts the 'year' column to float, then to int. The float conversion is able to handle the '.0' part of the string, and the int conversion then drops the decimal part.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error is because the value '2021.0' is a string representation of a float, not an integer. When you try to convert it directly to an integer, Python throws an error because it doesn't know how to handle the decimal point.

You can fix this by first converting the strings to floats, and then converting those floats to integers. Here's how you can do it:

```python
data_h_df['year'] = data_h_df['year'].astype(float).astype(int)
```

This code first converts the 'year' column to floats, which turns '2021.0' into 2021.0 (a float), and then it converts those floats to integers, which turns 2021.0 into 2021 (an integer).
