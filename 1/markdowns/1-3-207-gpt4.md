I am working on a simple code able to evaluate the end time of a period of time, given as a number of minutes (it could be arbitrarily large). The start time is given as a pair of hours (0..23) and minutes (0..59). The result has to be printed to the console.

So far I tried below code and finding difficult to get hours calculation please help.
```
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))
mins = (mins + dura)%60
hour = **** Please help this calculation ****
print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
#expected output is 13:16 (ex: given hour = 12 , mins = 17 , dura = 59 )
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

You can calculate the end hour by adding the start hour to the total hours of the duration. The total hours of the duration can be calculated by integer division of the duration by 60. However, you also need to add the hours from the minutes calculation (mins + dura) divided by 60. Finally, you need to take the result modulo 24 to get the hour in 24-hour format. Here is the code:

```python
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# calculate the end time
mins = (mins + dura) % 60
hour = (hour + dura // 60 + (mins + dura) // 60) % 24

print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
```

This code will work for any number of minutes, even if the duration is more than 24 hours (1440 minutes).

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can calculate the end hour by adding the start hour to the total hours of the duration. The total hours of the duration can be calculated by integer division of the duration by 60. If the sum of the start hour and the duration hours is greater than 23 (the maximum hour), you should calculate the remainder of the sum divided by 24 to get the hour in a 24-hour format. Here is the code:

```python
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

# Calculate the total hours and minutes
total_mins = mins + dura
mins = total_mins % 60
total_hours = hour + total_mins // 60

# Convert to 24-hour format
hour = total_hours % 24

print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
```

This code will work for any number of duration minutes, even if it's more than a day.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can calculate the end hour by adding the start hour to the total duration in hours. The total duration in hours is the integer division of the total duration in minutes by 60. However, you also need to add the carry from the minutes calculation, which is the integer division of the total duration in minutes by 60. Finally, you need to take the result modulo 24 to convert it to a 24-hour format. Here is the corrected code:

```python
hour = int(input("Starting time (hours): "))
mins = int(input("Starting time (minutes): "))
dura = int(input("Event duration (minutes): "))

mins = (mins + dura) % 60
hour = (hour + (dura // 60) + ((mins + dura) // 60)) % 24

print(hour, ":", mins, sep='')
```

In this code, `(dura // 60)` calculates the total duration in hours, and `((mins + dura) // 60)` calculates the carry from the minutes calculation. The `% 24` operation converts the result to a 24-hour format.
