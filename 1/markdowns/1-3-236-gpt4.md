I have set my linter for Python to Pylint, but I still get error messages from Jedi. I even went to settings.json and added the line `"python.linting.jediEnabled": false`, but the line, though present, is greyed out. What more can I do?

The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that Jedi is not only a linter but also an autocompletion library. So, even if you disable it as a linter, it might still be running for autocompletion.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Disable Jedi as an autocompletion library**: You can do this by adding the following line to your settings.json file:
    ```json
    "python.jediEnabled": false
    ```
2. **Switch to a different autocompletion library**: If you're still having issues with Jedi, you might want to consider switching to a different autocompletion library. Microsoft's Python Language Server or the newer Pylance are both good options. You can switch to the Python Language Server by adding the following line to your settings.json file:
    ```json
    "python.languageServer": "Microsoft"
    ```
   Or switch to Pylance by first installing the Pylance extension from the Visual Studio Code marketplace and then adding the following line to your settings.json file:
    ```json
    "python.languageServer": "Pylance"
    ```
3. **Check for conflicting extensions**: If you're still having issues, it might be due to a conflict with another extension. Try disabling other Python-related extensions to see if that resolves the issue.

Remember to reload VS Code after making these changes to ensure they take effect.

The issue you're facing might be due to the fact that Jedi is not just a linter but also a library for autocompletion and code navigation. Therefore, even if you disable it as a linter, it might still be active for other tasks.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Check if you have any other extensions installed that might be using Jedi. If you find any, disable them and see if the problem persists.

2. Try to disable Jedi completely by adding the following line to your settings.json file:
   `"python.jediEnabled": false`
   
3. If the above steps don't work, you can try to uninstall and reinstall the Python extension. Sometimes, this can help to reset the settings and solve any conflicts.

4. If none of the above steps work, it might be a bug in the Python extension. In this case, you should report the issue to the developers of the extension. They might be able to provide a fix or a workaround.

Remember to restart your IDE after making these changes to ensure they take effect.

The issue you're experiencing might be due to the fact that Jedi is not only a linter but also an autocompletion library. So, even if you have disabled it as a linter, it might still be running for autocompletion and other features.

Here are a few steps you can take:

1. Check if you have any other extensions installed that might be using Jedi. If you do, disable them and see if the problem persists.

2. Try to disable Jedi completely by adding `"python.jediEnabled": false` to your settings.json file. This will disable all Jedi features, not just linting.

3. If you're using Visual Studio Code, you can switch to the Microsoft Python Language Server or Pylance, which are alternatives to Jedi. You can do this by adding `"python.languageServer": "Microsoft"` or `"python.languageServer": "Pylance"` to your settings.json file.

4. If none of the above works, it might be a bug. In this case, you should report it to the developers of the extension you're using.
