I have a tensor `inps`, which has a size of `[64, 161, 1]` and I have some new data `d` which has a size of `[64, 161]`. How can I add `d` to `inps` such that the new size is `[64, 161, 2]`?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

You can achieve this by first expanding the dimensions of `d` and then concatenating `inps` and `d`. Here's how you can do it in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
d = d.unsqueeze(2)  # This will change the size of d to [64, 161, 1]
inps = torch.cat((inps, d), dim=2)  # This will concatenate inps and d along the third dimension
```

And here's how you can do it in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
d = tf.expand_dims(d, axis=2)  # This will change the size of d to [64, 161, 1]
inps = tf.concat([inps, d], axis=2)  # This will concatenate inps and d along the third dimension
```

In both cases, the size of `inps` after the operation will be `[64, 161, 2]`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can achieve this by first expanding the dimensions of `d` to match the dimensions of `inps`, and then concatenating the two tensors along the third dimension. Here is how you can do it in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
# inps.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 1])
# d.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161])

# First expand dimensions of d
d_expanded = d.unsqueeze(2) # d_expanded.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 1])

# Now concatenate along the third dimension
result = torch.cat((inps, d_expanded), dim=2) # result.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 2])
```

And here is how you can do it in TensorFlow:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
# inps.shape -> (64, 161, 1)
# d.shape -> (64, 161)

# First expand dimensions of d
d_expanded = tf.expand_dims(d, axis=2) # d_expanded.shape -> (64, 161, 1)

# Now concatenate along the third dimension
result = tf.concat([inps, d_expanded], axis=2) # result.shape -> (64, 161, 2)
```

In both cases, the resulting tensor has the desired shape of `[64, 161, 2]`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by first expanding the dimensions of `d` to match the dimensions of `inps`, and then concatenating the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's how you can do it in PyTorch:

```python
import torch

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
# inps.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 1])
# d.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161])

# Expand dimensions of d to match inps
d_expanded = d.unsqueeze(-1) # now d_expanded.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 1])

# Concatenate along the last dimension
result = torch.cat((inps, d_expanded), dim=-1) # result.shape -> torch.Size([64, 161, 2])
```

In TensorFlow, you can do the same thing using `tf.expand_dims` and `tf.concat`:

```python
import tensorflow as tf

# Assuming inps and d are your tensors
# inps.shape -> (64, 161, 1)
# d.shape -> (64, 161)

# Expand dimensions of d to match inps
d_expanded = tf.expand_dims(d, axis=-1) # now d_expanded.shape -> (64, 161, 1)

# Concatenate along the last dimension
result = tf.concat([inps, d_expanded], axis=-1) # result.shape -> (64, 161, 2)
```
