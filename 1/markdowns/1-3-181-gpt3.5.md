I have a 3D NumPy array like so:
```
[[[4 1 5 2 5 5 7 8 9 7]
  [7 4 2 4 7 8 4 1 3 5]
  [6 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 7 6]
  [5 5 5 0 5 4 3 8 7 1]
  [2 8 6 7 4 7 5 5 5 1]]

 [[9 9 5 8 0 7 3 9 8 1]
  [9 1 9 5 7 4 5 4 7 0]
  [1 0 4 8 7 3 4 3 8 8]
  [8 1 3 1 7 0 9 9 3 8]
  [4 0 2 3 8 2 0 1 2 4]]

 [[1 6 2 4 4 0 2 3 0 3]
  [9 6 8 6 6 5 6 9 4 1]
  [0 4 0 2 9 1 1 2 4 6]
  [6 1 9 9 7 8 9 7 6 8]
  [9 3 9 0 7 0 0 0 7 0]]]
```

With it, I like to create a 2d ndarray like so:
```
[[6]
 [9]
 [9]]
```

Where each element of this 2d array is the max value of the third column on the original array:

I have been a couple of hours trying to puzzle this out but no luck...
I'm asking for a 2d array as the output because I have other calculations to make (say, I also need to min value of the second column in a similar fashion), but I think I can extrapolate those from this.
Any pointers are greatly appreciated!

You can use NumPy's `max()` function along with indexing to achieve this. Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                 [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                 [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                 [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                 [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],
                [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                 [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                 [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                 [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                 [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],
                [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3],
                 [9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1],
                 [0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6],
                 [6, 1, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 8],
                 [9, 3, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]])

result = np.max(arr[:, :, 2], axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[[6]
 [9]
 [9]]
```

Here, we first select the third column of all the 2D arrays in the 3D array using `arr[:, :, 2]`. Then, we use the `max()` function along the second axis (axis=1) to get the maximum value of each row. Finally, we reshape the resulting 1D array to a 2D array with one column using `reshape(-1, 1)`.

You can use NumPy's `max` function along with indexing to achieve this. Here's the code:

```python
import numpy as np

arr = np.array([[[4, 1, 5, 2, 5, 5, 7, 8, 9, 7],
                 [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                 [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                 [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                 [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],

                [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                 [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                 [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                 [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                 [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],

                [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3],
                 [9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1],
                 [0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6],
                 [6, 1, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 8],
                 [9, 3, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]])

result = np.max(arr[:, :, 2], axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)
print(result)
```

Output:
```
[[6]
 [9]
 [9]]
```

Here, we first select the third column of all the matrices in the 3D array using indexing (`arr[:, :, 2]`). Then, we use the `max` function along the second axis (axis=1) to get the maximum value of each row. Finally, we reshape the resulting 1D array to a 2D array with one column using the `reshape` function.

                 [7, 4, 2, 4, 7, 8, 4, 1, 3, 5],
                 [6, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 7, 6],
                 [5, 5, 5, 0, 5, 4, 3, 8, 7, 1],
                 [2, 8, 6, 7, 4, 7, 5, 5, 5, 1]],

                [[9, 9, 5, 8, 0, 7, 3, 9, 8, 1],
                 [9, 1, 9, 5, 7, 4, 5, 4, 7, 0],
                 [1, 0, 4, 8, 7, 3, 4, 3, 8, 8],
                 [8, 1, 3, 1, 7, 0, 9, 9, 3, 8],
                 [4, 0, 2, 3, 8, 2, 0, 1, 2, 4]],

                [[1, 6, 2, 4, 4, 0, 2, 3, 0, 3],
                 [9, 6, 8, 6, 6, 5, 6, 9, 4, 1],
                 [0, 4, 0, 2, 9, 1, 1, 2, 4, 6],
                 [6, 1, 9, 9, 7, 8, 9, 7, 6, 8],
                 [9, 3, 9, 0, 7, 0, 0, 0, 7, 0]]])

result = arr[:, :, 2].max(axis=1).reshape(-1, 1)

print(result)
```

Output:
```
array([[6],
       [9],
       [9]])
```

Here, we first extract the third column of each 2D array in the 3D array using indexing (`arr[:, :, 2]`). Then, we use the `max` function along the second axis (i.e., axis=1) to get the maximum value of each row. Finally, we reshape the resulting 1D array into a 2D array with one column and as many rows as there are 2D arrays in the original 3D array.
