How to write a list of list into excel using python 3?

```
new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]
with open("file_name.csv", 'w') as f:
    fc = csv.writer(f, lineterminator='\n')
fc.writerows(new_list)
```

I can write this list into `csv` file but How canI want to write in excel file?

You can use the `openpyxl` library to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is how you can do it:

First, install the library if you haven't done so:

```shell
pip install openpyxl
```

Then, you can use the following code to write your list of lists into an Excel file:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet
wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active

# Write the data to the worksheet
for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

# Save the workbook
wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

This code will create a new Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write your list of lists into it. Each inner list will be written into a new row in the Excel file.

You can use the `openpyxl` or `pandas` library in Python to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is an example using `openpyxl`:

```python
from openpyxl import Workbook

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

wb = Workbook()
ws = wb.active

for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

And here is an example using `pandas`:

```python
import pandas as pd

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

df = pd.DataFrame(new_list)

df.to_excel('file_name.xlsx', index=False, header=False)
```

Both of these scripts will create a new Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write the data from `new_list` into it. The `pandas` method is generally simpler and more powerful, but requires that you have the `pandas` and `openpyxl` or `xlsxwriter` libraries installed. The `openpyxl` method only requires the `openpyxl` library.

You can use the `openpyxl` library in Python to write a list of lists into an Excel file. Here is how you can do it:

new_list = [["first", "second"], ["third", "fourth"]]

# Create a workbook and select the active worksheet

# Write the data to the worksheet
for i in range(len(new_list)):
    for j in range(len(new_list[i])):
        ws.cell(row=i+1, column=j+1, value=new_list[i][j])

# Save the workbook
wb.save("file_name.xlsx")
```

This will create an Excel file named `file_name.xlsx` and write your list of lists into it. The `ws.cell` method is used to write a value to a specific cell, specified by its row and column numbers. The `row` and `column` parameters are 1-indexed, so we add 1 to the indices from the list.
