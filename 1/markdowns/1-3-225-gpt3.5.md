I'm trying to create a function that turns text into pig Latin: simple text transformation that modifies each word moving the first character to the end and appending "ay" to the end. But all I get is an empty list. Any tips?
```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    return word

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

The issue with your code is that the `return` statement is inside the `for` loop. This means that the function returns the first word after it has been transformed, but it never gets to the other words in the loop. To fix this, you can move the `return` statement outside of the loop, after all the words have been transformed. Here's the corrected code:

```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  new_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    new_word = ''.join(them)
    new_words.append(new_word)
  return ' '.join(new_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this corrected code, we create a new list `new_words` to store the transformed words. We then loop through each word in `words`, transform it, and append it to `new_words`. Finally, we join all the words in `new_words` with spaces and return the resulting string.

The issue with your code is that you are returning the first word after transforming it, so the loop only runs once. You need to move the return statement outside the loop and append each transformed word to the `say` variable. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    say += word + " "
  return say.strip()

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

This should give you the correct output.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue with your code is that you are returning the first word after the first iteration of the loop. You need to move the return statement outside of the loop so that it returns the entire sentence after all the words have been transformed. Here's a corrected version of your code:

```
def pig_latin(text):
  say = ""
  words = text.split()
  new_words = []
  for word in words:
    endString = str(word[1]).upper()+str(word[2:])
    them = endString, str(word[0:1]).lower(), 'ay'
    word = ''.join(them)
    new_words.append(word)
  return ' '.join(new_words)

print(pig_latin("hello how are you")) # Should be "ellohay owhay reaay ouyay"
print(pig_latin("programming in python is fun")) # Should be "rogrammingpay niay ythonpay siay unfay"
```

In this version, we create a new list called `new_words` to store the transformed words. We append each transformed word to this list, and then join all the words together with spaces before returning the final sentence.
