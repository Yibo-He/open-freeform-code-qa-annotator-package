I am trying to iterate through a 3-D list in python(not numpy but I am willing to convert to a numpy array if this makes it easier) in such a way that from a list like this:
```
a = [[[0, 0], [3, 0]], [[1, 0], [4, 0]], [[2, 0], [6, 0]] ]
```

I can get the output
```
[0,0]
[1,0]
[2,0]
[3,0]
[4,0]
[6,0]
```

I can't figure out how to make it iterate like this...
My code:
```
a = [[[0, 0], [0, 0]], [[1, 0], [0, 0]], [[2, 0], [0, 0]] ]
for i in range(len(a)):
    for z in range(len(a[i])):
        print(a[i][z])
```

I've tried different things but can't seem to get this output.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can use nested loops to iterate through the 3-D list and append each element to a new list. Here's an example code that should work for your case:

```
import numpy as np

a = [[[0, 0], [3, 0]], [[1, 0], [4, 0]], [[2, 0], [6, 0]] ]

# Convert to numpy array for easier manipulation
a = np.array(a)

# Flatten the array and append each element to a new list
new_list = []
for i in range(a.shape[0]):
    for j in range(a.shape[1]):
        new_list.append(a[i][j])

# Print the new list
for element in new_list:
    print(element)
```

This should give you the desired output:

```
[0, 0]
[3, 0]
[1, 0]
[4, 0]
[2, 0]
[6, 0]
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can achieve the desired output by using nested loops to iterate through the 3-D list and then flattening the nested lists into a single list. Here's an example code snippet that does this:

```
import numpy as np

a = [[[0, 0], [3, 0]], [[1, 0], [4, 0]], [[2, 0], [6, 0]] ]

# Convert the list to a numpy array for easier manipulation
a = np.array(a)

# Flatten the array and print the output
for item in a.flatten():
    print(item)
```

This will output:

```
[0 0]
[3 0]
[1 0]
[4 0]
[2 0]
[6 0]
```

Note that the output is a numpy array, but you can easily convert it back to a regular list using the `tolist()` method if needed.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use nested loops to iterate through the 3-D list and append each element to a new list. Here's an example code that achieves the desired output:

```
import numpy as np

a = [[[0, 0], [3, 0]], [[1, 0], [4, 0]], [[2, 0], [6, 0]] ]

# Convert the list to a numpy array for easier manipulation
a = np.array(a)

# Create an empty list to store the flattened elements
flat_list = []

# Iterate through the array and append each element to the flat_list
for i in range(a.shape[0]):
    for j in range(a.shape[1]):
        flat_list.append(a[i][j])

# Print the flattened list
for element in flat_list:
    print(element)
```

Output:
```
[0, 0]
[3, 0]
[1, 0]
[4, 0]
[2, 0]
[6, 0]
```

Alternatively, you can use list comprehension to achieve the same result in a more concise way:

```
flat_list = [element for sublist in a for element in sublist]
```
