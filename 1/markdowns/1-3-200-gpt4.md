Essentially, I am trying to use a subprocess call to checkout a git commit at a specific sha hash.

However, I keep getting the error `subprocess.CalledProcessError: Command '['git', 'checkout', '62bbce43e']' returned non-zero exit status 128.`

This is my code below:

```
with open(filename) as inputfile:
    reader = csv.reader(inputfile, delimiter=",")
    linecount = 0
    for row in reader:
        if linecount == 0:
            linecount += 1
        else:
            repo = str(row[0])
            sha = str(row[2])
            specificfile = str(row[3])
            linenum = int(row[4])
            cl("cd", repo)
            subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', sha])
            print("checkout done")
            git("checkout", "-")
```

The error message you're seeing usually means that the command you're trying to run in the subprocess is failing. In this case, it seems like the `git checkout` command is failing.

One possible reason for this could be that the SHA hash you're trying to checkout doesn't exist in your repository. You can verify this by manually running `git checkout 62bbce43e` in your repository and seeing if it works.

Another possible issue could be that your Python script is not in the correct directory when it tries to run the `git checkout` command. The `subprocess` module runs commands in the current working directory of your Python script, which might not be the same as the directory of your Git repository.

You're using `cl("cd", repo)` to change directories, but it's not clear what this function does. If it's supposed to change the current working directory of your Python script, it might not be working as expected.

Instead, you can use `os.chdir(repo)` to change the current working directory of your Python script. Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import os
import csv
import subprocess

with open(filename) as inputfile:
    reader = csv.reader(inputfile, delimiter=",")
    linecount = 0
    for row in reader:
        if linecount == 0:
            linecount += 1
        else:
            repo = str(row[0])
            sha = str(row[2])
            specificfile = str(row[3])
            linenum = int(row[4])
            os.chdir(repo)
            subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', sha])
            print("checkout done")
            subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', '-'])
```

This code will change the current working directory to `repo` before running the `git checkout` command. If `repo` is the path to your Git repository, this should allow the `git checkout` command to run successfully.

Remember to handle exceptions for the case when the `repo` directory doesn't exist or the `sha` is not found in the repository.

The error you're getting is likely because the SHA hash you're trying to checkout doesn't exist in your repository. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Verify the SHA hash: Make sure that the SHA hash you're trying to checkout actually exists in your repository. You can do this by running `git log` in your repository and looking for the hash.

2. Check your repository path: Make sure that the path to your repository is correct. The `cd` command you're using to change directories won't actually change the directory for the `subprocess.check_output` command. This is because each subprocess command runs in its own shell environment, so changes made in one command won't affect the others. You can fix this by using the `cwd` parameter of the `subprocess.check_output` command to set the working directory, like this:

```python
subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', sha], cwd=repo)
```

3. Handle exceptions: It's a good practice to handle exceptions in your code. This way, you can catch any errors that occur and handle them appropriately. Here's how you can modify your code to handle the `CalledProcessError`:

```python
try:
    subprocess.check_output(['git', 'checkout', sha], cwd=repo)
    print("checkout done")
except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
    print(f"Error checking out commit: {e.output}")
```

This will print the output of the command that caused the error, which can help you debug the issue.

The error you're seeing is likely because the SHA hash you're trying to checkout doesn't exist in your repository. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Verify the SHA hash: Make sure that the SHA hash you're trying to checkout actually exists in your repository. You can do this by running `git log` and looking for the SHA hash in the output.

2. Use absolute path for the repository: Instead of using `cd` to change the current working directory, you can specify the repository directly in the `subprocess.check_output` call. This can help avoid issues with relative paths.

3. Error handling: Add some error handling to your script to catch exceptions and print out useful debug information. This can help you figure out exactly what's going wrong.

Here's how you might modify your script to incorporate these suggestions:

```python
import os
import csv
import subprocess

with open(filename) as inputfile:
    reader = csv.reader(inputfile, delimiter=",")
    linecount = 0
    for row in reader:
        if linecount == 0:
            linecount += 1
        else:
            repo = str(row[0])
            sha = str(row[2])
            specificfile = str(row[3])
            linenum = int(row[4])
            try:
                subprocess.check_output(['git', '-C', repo, 'checkout', sha])
                print("checkout done")
            except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
                print(f"Failed to checkout {sha} in repository {repo}. Error: {e}")
```

In this script, I've used the `-C` option with the `git` command to specify the repository, and I've added a `try`/`except` block to catch `CalledProcessError` exceptions and print out some useful debug information.
