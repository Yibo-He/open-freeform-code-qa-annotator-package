I am trying to have a user interface using PyQt5 and pyqtgraph. I made two checkboxes and whenever I select them I want to plot one of the two data sets available in the code and whenever I deselect a button I want it to clear the corresponding curve. There are two checkboxes with texts `A1` and `A2` and each of them plot one set of data.
I have two issues:
1- If I select `A1` it plots the data associated with `A1` and as long as I do not select `A2`, by deselecting `A1` I can clear the data associated with `A1`.
However, If I check `A1` box and then I check `A2` box, then deselecting `A1` does not clear the associated plot. In this situation, if I choose to plot random data, instead of a deterministic curve such as `sin`, I see that by selecting either button new data is added but it cannot be removed.
2- The real application have 96 buttons each of which should be associated to one data set. I think the way I wrote the code is inefficient because I need to copy the same code for one button and data set 96 times. Is there a way to generalize the toy code I presented below to arbitrary number of checkboxes? Or perhaps, using/copying the almost the same code for every button is the usual and correct way to do this?
The code is:
```
from PyQt5 import QtWidgets, uic, QtGui
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.widgets import SpanSelector
import numpy as np
import sys
import string
import pyqtgraph as pg
from pyqtgraph.Qt import QtGui, QtCore

app = QtWidgets.QApplication(sys.argv)

x = np.linspace(0, 3.14, 100)
y1 = np.sin(x)#Data number 1 associated to checkbox A1
y2 = np.cos(x)#Data number 2 associated to checkbox A2

#This function is called whenever the state of checkboxes changes
def todo():
    if cbx1.isChecked():
        global curve1
        curve1 = plot.plot(x, y1, pen = 'r')
    else:
        try:
            plot.removeItem(curve1)
        except NameError:
            pass
    if cbx2.isChecked():
        global curve2
        curve2 = plot.plot(x, y2, pen = 'y')
    else:
        try:
            plot.removeItem(curve2)
        except NameError:
            pass  
#A widget to hold all of my future widgets
widget_holder = QtGui.QWidget()

#Checkboxes named A1 and A2
cbx1 = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
cbx1.setText('A1')
cbx1.stateChanged.connect(todo)

cbx2 = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
cbx2.setText('A2')
cbx2.stateChanged.connect(todo)

#Making a pyqtgraph plot widget
plot = pg.PlotWidget()

#Setting the layout
layout = QtGui.QGridLayout()
widget_holder.setLayout(layout)

#Adding the widgets to the layout
layout.addWidget(cbx1, 0,0)
layout.addWidget(cbx2, 0, 1)
layout.addWidget(plot, 1,0, 3,1)

widget_holder.adjustSize()
widget_holder.show()

sys.exit(app.exec_())
```

For your first issue, the problem is that you are using global variables `curve1` and `curve2` to store the plot curves. When you select both checkboxes, both curves are plotted and stored in their respective global variables. However, when you deselect `A1`, you are only removing `curve1`, but `curve2` is still plotted. To fix this, you can use a list to store the curves and remove all of them when a checkbox is deselected. Here's the modified `todo` function:

```
def todo():
    curves = []
    if cbx1.isChecked():
        curves.append(plot.plot(x, y1, pen='r'))
    if cbx2.isChecked():
        curves.append(plot.plot(x, y2, pen='y'))
    if not cbx1.isChecked() or not cbx2.isChecked():
        for curve in curves:
            plot.removeItem(curve)
```

For your second issue, you can create the checkboxes and their associated data sets dynamically using a loop. Here's an example:

```
# List of data sets
data_sets = [np.sin(x), np.cos(x), np.tan(x), np.exp(x), np.log(x)]

# List of checkbox labels
checkbox_labels = list(string.ascii_uppercase)[:len(data_sets)]

# Dictionary to store the curves
curves = {}

# Loop to create checkboxes and connect them to the todo function
for i, label in enumerate(checkbox_labels):
    cbx = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    cbx.setText(label)
    cbx.stateChanged.connect(todo)
    layout.addWidget(cbx, i, 0)
    curves[label] = None

# todo function modified to use the curves dictionary
def todo():
    for label, data in zip(checkbox_labels, data_sets):
        if eval(f"cbx{label}.isChecked()"):
            if curves[label] is None:
                curves[label] = plot.plot(x, data, pen='r')
        else:
            if curves[label] is not None:
                plot.removeItem(curves[label])
                curves[label] = None
```

This creates checkboxes labeled `A` to `E` and associates them with the data sets in `data_sets`. The `curves` dictionary is used to store the plot curves for each checkbox label. The `todo` function is modified to use the `curves` dictionary and the `eval` function is used to dynamically access the checkbox objects based on their labels.

For your first issue, the problem is that you are using global variables `curve1` and `curve2` to store the plot items. When you check both checkboxes, both variables are defined and the `try` block in the `else` statement will not execute, so the curves will not be removed when you uncheck one of the checkboxes. To solve this, you can use a list to store the plot items and remove them all at once when a checkbox is unchecked. Here's the modified `todo` function:

```
def todo():
    curves = []
    if cbx1.isChecked():
        curves.append(plot.plot(x, y1, pen='r'))
    if cbx2.isChecked():
        curves.append(plot.plot(x, y2, pen='y'))
    if not cbx1.isChecked() or not cbx2.isChecked():
        plot.removeItem(curves)
```

For your second issue, you can create the checkboxes and data sets dynamically using a loop. Here's an example:

```
# List of data sets
data_sets = [np.sin(x), np.cos(x), np.tan(x), np.exp(x)]

# Create checkboxes and connect them to the todo function
checkboxes = []
for i in range(len(data_sets)):
    cbx = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    cbx.setText(f'A{i+1}')
    cbx.stateChanged.connect(todo)
    checkboxes.append(cbx)

# Add checkboxes and plot to the layout
for i, cbx in enumerate(checkboxes):
    layout.addWidget(cbx, i, 0)
for i, data in enumerate(data_sets):
    plot.plot(x, data, pen=pg.intColor(i))
layout.addWidget(plot, len(data_sets), 0, 1, len(checkboxes))
```

This code creates checkboxes and data sets based on the length of the `data_sets` list. You can modify the list to include all 96 data sets and adjust the layout accordingly.

For your first issue, the problem is that you are using global variables `curve1` and `curve2` to store the plot curves. When you check both checkboxes, both curves are plotted and stored in their respective global variables. However, when you uncheck one of the checkboxes, you are only removing the curve associated with that checkbox, but the other curve is still stored in its global variable. So, when you try to plot a new curve, it is plotted on top of the existing curve, which is still stored in its global variable.

To fix this issue, you can store the curves in a dictionary instead of using global variables. The keys of the dictionary can be the names of the checkboxes, and the values can be the plot curves. Then, when you uncheck a checkbox, you can remove the curve associated with that checkbox from the dictionary.

Here's the modified `todo` function that uses a dictionary to store the plot curves:
```
curves = {}

def todo():
    if cbx1.isChecked():
        curves['A1'] = plot.plot(x, y1, pen='r')
    else:
        if 'A1' in curves:
            plot.removeItem(curves['A1'])
            del curves['A1']
    if cbx2.isChecked():
        curves['A2'] = plot.plot(x, y2, pen='y')
    else:
        if 'A2' in curves:
            plot.removeItem(curves['A2'])
            del curves['A2']
```

For your second issue, you can create the checkboxes and their associated data sets dynamically using a loop. Here's an example code that creates 4 checkboxes and their associated data sets:
```
data_sets = {
    'A1': np.sin(x),
    'A2': np.cos(x),
    'B1': np.tan(x),
    'B2': np.exp(x)
}

curves = {}

def todo():
    for cbx_name, data in data_sets.items():
        cbx = checkboxes[cbx_name]
        if cbx.isChecked():
            curves[cbx_name] = plot.plot(x, data, pen='r')
        else:
            if cbx_name in curves:
                plot.removeItem(curves[cbx_name])
                del curves[cbx_name]

checkboxes = {}
for i, cbx_name in enumerate(data_sets.keys()):
    cbx = QtWidgets.QCheckBox()
    cbx.setText(cbx_name)
    cbx.stateChanged.connect(todo)
    checkboxes[cbx_name] = cbx
    layout.addWidget(cbx, i, 0)
```
