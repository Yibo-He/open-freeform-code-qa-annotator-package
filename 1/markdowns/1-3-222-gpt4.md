Hi please do let me know what is wrong with my recurrence relation.
My Logic:
The number of ways to allot the first `element=k` and number of ways such that the `next (n-1)` elements are different `(k-1)*f(n-2)`
and number of ways to allot two same elements: `k + (k-1)*f(n-1)`
Hence the relation:
`no. of ways = âˆ‘(k + (k-1)*f(n-1) + k + (k-1)*f(n-1))`
I can see some mistakes like the inclusion of duplicates, however, I am unable to figure out the relation.
You can also find the code below:
```
def count_num_ways(n, k):
        dp = [0 for i in range(n+1)]

        dp[0] = 0
        dp[1] = k

        for i in range(2, n+1):
            dp[i] =  sum(
                [
                     k+( k-1 )*dp[n-2],
                     k+(k-1)*dp[n-1]-k
                ]
            )

        print(dp)
```

Thanks.

Your recurrence relation seems to be a bit off. If I understand correctly, you're trying to find the number of ways to arrange `n` items with `k` different types, such that no two adjacent items are the same. 

If that's the case, then the recurrence relation should be as follows:

- For the first item, there are `k` ways to choose it.
- For the second item, there are `k-1` ways to choose it (since it can't be the same as the first item).
- For the third item onwards, each item can be chosen in `k-1` ways (since it can't be the same as the previous item).

So, the recurrence relation should be:

- `f(1) = k`
- `f(2) = k * (k-1)`
- `f(n) = (k-1) * (f(n-1) + f(n-2))` for `n > 2`

This is because for the `n`-th item, it can be either the same as the `(n-2)`-th item (and different from the `(n-1)`-th item), or different from both the `(n-1)`-th and `(n-2)`-th items.

Here's how the corrected code should look like:

```python
def count_num_ways(n, k):
    dp = [0 for _ in range(n+1)]

    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = k
    if n > 1:
        dp[2] = k * (k-1)

    for i in range(3, n+1):
        dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])

    print(dp)
```

This code will correctly calculate the number of ways to arrange `n` items with `k` different types, such that no two adjacent items are the same.

From your logic, it seems like you're trying to find the number of ways to arrange `n` elements with `k` different types such that no two adjacent elements are the same. 

The recurrence relation you've written seems to be a bit off. Let's break it down:

- If we have `n` elements and `k` different types, we can choose any of the `k` types for the first element.
- For the next `n-1` elements, we have `k-1` choices (since we can't repeat the previous element).
- The number of ways to allot the first element is `k`. The number of ways such that the next `n-1` elements are different is `(k-1)*f(n-1)`.
- The number of ways to allot two same elements is `k + (k-1)*f(n-2)`.

So, the correct recurrence relation should be:

`f(n) = k*(k-1)^(n-1)`

And the code should be:

```python
def count_num_ways(n, k):
    dp = [0 for i in range(n+1)]

    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = k

    for i in range(2, n+1):
        dp[i] = k * ((k-1) ** (i-1))

    print(dp)
```

This code will correctly calculate the number of ways to arrange `n` elements with `k` different types such that no two adjacent elements are the same.

Your recurrence relation seems to be a bit off. The logic you're trying to implement is not clear from the description you've given. However, if you're trying to count the number of ways to arrange `n` elements with `k` different types, where no two adjacent elements can be the same, then the recurrence relation would be:

`dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])`

Here's the explanation:
- For the first element, there are `k` possibilities.
- For the second element, it can be any of the remaining `k-1` types, so there are `k*(k-1)` possibilities for the first two elements.
- For the third and subsequent elements, each one can be any of the `k-1` types that are not the same as the immediately preceding element. This can be achieved in one of two ways:
  - The element is different from the last two elements. This can be done in `dp[i-2] * (k-1)` ways.
  - The element is the same as the second last element but different from the last element. This can be done in `dp[i-1] * (k-1)` ways.
  
So the total number of possibilities for `i` elements is `(k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def count_num_ways(n, k):
    dp = [0 for i in range(n+1)]

    # base cases
    dp[0] = 0
    dp[1] = k
    if n > 1:
        dp[2] = k * (k-1)

    # fill the dp table
    for i in range(3, n+1):
        dp[i] = (k-1) * (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2])

    print(dp)
```

This code will print the number of ways for each number of elements from 0 to `n`. The final answer will be `dp[n]`.
