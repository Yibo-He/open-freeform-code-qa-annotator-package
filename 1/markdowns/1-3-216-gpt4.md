I ordered a MacBook Pro equipped with an M1 ARM processor. Will I be able to run [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) and install dev tools like Python, Node etc..?

Yes, you can run Homebrew and install dev tools like Python, Node etc. on a MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. 

Homebrew has been updated to work on Apple's M1 ARM architecture. However, not all packages may be available or fully functional, as the transition to the new architecture is still ongoing. 

For Python, Node, and many other popular tools, there are versions available that work on the M1 ARM architecture. You may need to use Rosetta 2, Apple's technology for translating software compiled for Intel processors to work on ARM architecture, for some tools or packages that haven't been updated yet.

Remember to always check the official documentation or community forums for the most up-to-date and detailed information.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Yes, you can run Homebrew and install development tools like Python, Node, etc. on a MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. However, there are a few things you should be aware of:

1. Homebrew: Homebrew has been updated to work on Apple's M1 ARM processors. However, not all packages available through Homebrew are compatible with the M1 chip yet. You can install Homebrew in a subdirectory of your home directory (e.g., /opt/homebrew) to avoid conflicts with Rosetta 2, Apple's technology for translating apps built for Intel processors.

2. Python: Python 3.9.1 and later versions provide support for Apple's M1 processors. You can install it using Homebrew or directly from the Python website.

3. Node.js: Node.js also supports Apple's M1 processors. You can install it using Homebrew, or you can download it directly from the Node.js website.

In general, while many popular development tools have been updated to support the M1 chip, you might still encounter some that don't. In such cases, you can use Rosetta 2 to run apps that were designed for Intel processors.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can run Homebrew on a MacBook Pro with an M1 ARM processor. Homebrew has been updated to work on Apple's new M1 chips. You can install it and use it to install other development tools like Python, Node.js, etc.

However, please note that not all packages available through Homebrew may be fully compatible with the M1 architecture yet. Some packages may still need to be run under Rosetta 2, Apple's technology for translating apps built for Intel processors to run on M1 processors.

For the most part, you should be able to use Homebrew and your tools as usual, but you may encounter some issues or limitations due to the new architecture. Always check the official documentation or forums for any tool you're having trouble with, as there may be workarounds or updates available to address compatibility issues.
