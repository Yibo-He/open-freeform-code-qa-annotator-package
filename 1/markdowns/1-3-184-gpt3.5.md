I am completely new to `openpyxl` so, as you can imagine, I am having pretty hard times when I try to make use of it.
I have an Excel report that contains only one sheet (called `Sheet1)`. I'd like to search all cells for those that contain specific string (product name ABC in this case).
Then I would like to copy contents of every cell in the rows that contain cell with `ABC` product name. And assign every cell to a variable.
To give you better idea of what I am trying to achieve I'll give you an example:

So in this case I would only copy cells from rows: 2, 4, 6 (as only they contain `ABC` product).
I have already looked up similar questions and answers to them but I don't understand them (never have used Excel before).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

No worries, I can help you with that. Here's a code snippet that should do what you're asking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the worksheet
worksheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the search term
search_term = 'ABC'

# Create a list to store the results
results = []

# Loop through each row in the worksheet
for row in worksheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through each cell in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the search term
        if search_term in str(cell.value):

            # If it does, add the entire row to the results list
            results.append([cell.value for cell in row])

# Print the results
for row in results:
    print(row)
```

This code will load the Excel file, select the `Sheet1` worksheet, and define the search term as `ABC`. It will then loop through each row in the worksheet, and for each row, loop through each cell. If the cell contains the search term, it will add the entire row to the `results` list. Finally, it will print out the results.

Note that this code assumes that the first row of the worksheet contains the column headers. If this is not the case, you'll need to modify the code accordingly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

No problem, I can help you with that. Here is a sample code that should do what you are asking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the product name to search for
product_name = 'ABC'

# Loop through all the rows in the sheet
for row in sheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the product name
        if cell.value == product_name:

            # If it does, copy the contents of every cell in the row
            row_contents = []
            for row_cell in row:
                row_contents.append(row_cell.value)

            # Assign every cell to a variable
            cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4, cell5 = row_contents

            # Do something with the variables (e.g. print them)
            print(cell1, cell2, cell3, cell4, cell5)
```

This code should loop through all the cells in the sheet and check if they contain the product name. If a cell does contain the product name, it will copy the contents of every cell in the row and assign them to variables. You can then do something with these variables (e.g. print them).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

No worries, I can help you with that. Here's some code that should do what you're looking for:

```python
import openpyxl

# Load the workbook
workbook = openpyxl.load_workbook('example.xlsx')

# Select the sheet
sheet = workbook['Sheet1']

# Define the product name to search for
product_name = 'ABC'

# Create a list to store the rows that contain the product name
rows_with_product = []

# Loop through all the rows in the sheet
for row in sheet.iter_rows():

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Check if the cell contains the product name
        if cell.value == product_name:

            # If it does, add the row to the list
            rows_with_product.append(row)

# Create a dictionary to store the cell values
cell_values = {}

# Loop through all the rows that contain the product name
for row in rows_with_product:

    # Loop through all the cells in the row
    for cell in row:

        # Get the column letter for the cell
        column_letter = openpyxl.utils.get_column_letter(cell.column)

        # Create a key for the cell in the dictionary
        key = f'{column_letter}{cell.row}'

        # Add the cell value to the dictionary
        cell_values[key] = cell.value

# Print the cell values
print(cell_values)
```

This code should search for the product name 'ABC' in all cells in the sheet, and then copy the contents of every cell in the rows that contain the product name. The cell values are stored in a dictionary, where the keys are the cell references (e.g. 'A2', 'B2', 'C2', etc.) and the values are the cell values.

You'll need to replace 'example.xlsx' with the name of your Excel file. Let me know if you have any questions or if there's anything else I can help you with!
