I need to use environment variable "PATH" in yaml file which needs to be parsed with a script.  

This is the environment variable I have set on my terminal:

```
$ echo $PATH
/Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork
```


This is my sample.yml:

```
---
Top: ${PATH}/my.txt
Vars:
- a
- b
```


When I parse this yaml file with my script, I don't see `PATH` variables actual value. 

This is my script:

```
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.load_all(stream)
for doc in docs:
    for k,v in doc.items():
        print k, "->", v
    print "\n",
```


Output:

```
Top -> ${PATH}/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```


Expected output is:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```


Can someone help me figuring out the correct way to do it if I am doing it wrong way?

The issue is that the `${PATH}` syntax is not being interpreted as an environment variable by the YAML parser. One way to solve this is to use Python's string formatting to replace `${PATH}` with the actual value of the `PATH` environment variable before parsing the YAML file.

Here's an updated version of your script that does this:

```
import yaml
import os

# Read the YAML file as a string
with open("sample.yml", "r") as f:
    yaml_str = f.read()

# Replace ${PATH} with the actual value of the PATH environment variable
path_value = os.environ.get("PATH", "")
yaml_str = yaml_str.replace("${PATH}", path_value)

# Parse the YAML string
docs = yaml.load_all(yaml_str)

# Print the parsed YAML
for doc in docs:
    for k, v in doc.items():
        print(k, "->", v)
    print("\n")
```

This should produce the expected output:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```

The issue is that the environment variable `PATH` is not being expanded in the YAML file. You can use the `os.path.expandvars()` function to expand environment variables in a string.

Here's an updated version of your script that uses `os.path.expandvars()` to expand the `PATH` variable in the YAML file:

```
import yaml
import os
import sys

stream = open("sample.yml", "r")
docs = yaml.load_all(stream)
for doc in docs:
    for k,v in doc.items():
        if isinstance(v, str):
            doc[k] = os.path.expandvars(v)
    for k,v in doc.items():
        print k, "->", v
    print "\n",
```

In this version of the script, we check if the value of each key in the YAML file is a string. If it is, we use `os.path.expandvars()` to expand any environment variables in the string. We then print out the updated key-value pairs.

With this updated script, the output should be:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```

The issue here is that the `${PATH}` syntax is not being interpreted as an environment variable by the YAML parser. One way to solve this is to use Python's `os` module to replace `${PATH}` with the actual value of the `PATH` environment variable before parsing the YAML file.

Here's an updated version of your script that does this:

```
import yaml
import os

with open("sample.yml", "r") as stream:
    # Read the YAML file as a string
    yaml_str = stream.read()

    # Replace ${PATH} with the actual value of the PATH environment variable
    path_value = os.environ.get("PATH")
    if path_value:
        yaml_str = yaml_str.replace("${PATH}", path_value)

    # Parse the YAML string
    docs = yaml.load_all(yaml_str)

    # Print the parsed YAML
    for doc in docs:
        for k, v in doc.items():
            print(k, "->", v)
        print("\n")
```

This should produce the expected output:

```
Top -> /Users/abc/Downloads/tbwork/my.txt
Vars -> ['a', 'b']
```
