I would need to take the question about `json serialization of @dataclass` from [Make the Python json encoder support Python's new dataclasses](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51286748/make-the-python-json-encoder-support-pythons-new-dataclasses)  a bit further: consider when they are in a nested structure. 

Consider:

```
import json
from attr import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json
@dataclass
@dataclass_json
class Prod:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]
pjson = json.dumps(prods)
```


That gives us:

```
TypeError: Object of type Prod is not JSON serializable
```


Note the above does incorporate one of the answers [https://stackoverflow.com/a/59688140/1056563](https://stackoverflow.com/a/59688140/1056563) . It  claims to support the nested case via the `dataclass_json` decorator . Apparently that does not actually work. 

I also tried another of the answers [https://stackoverflow.com/a/51286749/1056563](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51286749/1056563) :

```
class EnhancedJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
        def default(s, o):
            if dataclasses.is_dataclass(o):
                return dataclasses.asdict(o)
            return super().default(o)
```


And I created a helper method for it:

```
def jdump(s,foo):
    return json.dumps(foo, cls=s.c.EnhancedJSONEncoder)
```


But using that method also did not effect the (error) result.  Any further tips?

The issue you're encountering is due to the fact that `json.dumps()` doesn't know how to serialize your custom `Prod` dataclass. You need to provide a way to convert your `Prod` objects into a serializable format.

The `dataclass_json` decorator should provide this functionality, but you need to use the `.to_json()` method it provides on your dataclass instances. However, this won't work directly with a list of `Prod` objects, as the list itself doesn't have a `.to_json()` method.

Here's a way to serialize a list of `Prod` objects:

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

@dataclass_json
@dataclass
class Prod:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]

# Convert each Prod object to JSON, then load it back into a Python dict
prods_dict = [json.loads(prod.to_json()) for prod in prods]

# Now you can serialize the list of dicts
pjson = json.dumps(prods_dict)

print(pjson)
```

This will output:

```json
[{"id": 1, "name": "A", "price": 25.3}, {"id": 2, "name": "B", "price": 79.95}]
```

This is a bit of a workaround, but it should solve your issue. If you find yourself doing this often, you might want to create a helper function to automate this process.

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that the `json.dumps()` function doesn't know how to serialize your `Prod` objects. You need to convert your `Prod` objects to a serializable format before passing them to `json.dumps()`. 

The `dataclass_json` decorator you're using provides a `to_dict()` method which can be used for this purpose. Here's how you can modify your code to make it work:

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

@dataclass
@dataclass_json
class Prod:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]
prods_dict = [prod.to_dict() for prod in prods]
pjson = json.dumps(prods_dict)
```

In this code, `[prod.to_dict() for prod in prods]` is a list comprehension that converts each `Prod` object in the `prods` list to a dictionary. The resulting list of dictionaries can be serialized by `json.dumps()` without any issues.

Regarding the `EnhancedJSONEncoder` class, it seems like you're not using it correctly. You should pass an instance of `EnhancedJSONEncoder` to `json.dumps()` as the `cls` argument, not the class itself. Here's how you can do it:

```python
import json
import dataclasses

class EnhancedJSONEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, o):
        if dataclasses.is_dataclass(o):
            return dataclasses.asdict(o)
        return super().default(o)

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]
pjson = json.dumps(prods, cls=EnhancedJSONEncoder)
```

In this code, `cls=EnhancedJSONEncoder` tells `json.dumps()` to use the `EnhancedJSONEncoder` class for serializing objects. The `default()` method of `EnhancedJSONEncoder` is called for objects that `json.dumps()` can't serialize by default. If the object is a dataclass, it's converted to a dictionary using `dataclasses.asdict()`. If it's not a dataclass, the `default()` method of the parent class is called.

The issue you're facing is because the `json.dumps()` method doesn't know how to serialize your custom `Prod` dataclass. You need to tell it how to convert your dataclass into a JSON serializable format.

The `dataclass_json` decorator you're using is from the `dataclasses_json` library, which provides its own methods for serializing and deserializing dataclasses to/from JSON. 

Here's how you can use it:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from dataclasses_json import dataclass_json

@dataclass_json
@dataclass
class Prod:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]

# Use the to_json() method provided by the dataclass_json decorator
pjson = Prod.schema().dumps(prods, many=True)
```

In the above code, `Prod.schema().dumps(prods, many=True)` is used to serialize a list of `Prod` instances to a JSON string. The `many=True` argument is used to indicate that we're serializing a list of objects, not just a single object.

If you want to stick with using `json.dumps()`, you can do so by providing a custom encoder that knows how to serialize your `Prod` dataclass:

```python
import json
from dataclasses import dataclass, asdict

@dataclass
class Prod:
    id: int
    name: str
    price: float

class ProdEncoder(json.JSONEncoder):
    def default(self, obj):
        if isinstance(obj, Prod):
            return asdict(obj)
        return super().default(obj)

prods = [Prod(1,'A',25.3),Prod(2,'B',79.95)]

pjson = json.dumps(prods, cls=ProdEncoder)
```

In this code, `ProdEncoder` is a custom JSON encoder that converts `Prod` instances into dictionaries using the `asdict()` function from the `dataclasses` module. This dictionary can then be serialized to JSON by the `json.dumps()` method.
