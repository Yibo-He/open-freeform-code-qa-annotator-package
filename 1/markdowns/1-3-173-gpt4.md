Is there a way to calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas? I have explored dt.dayofyear but this function seem to provide the number of days from the start of the year until my datetime variable.

As an example, if my date is 2020-03-30, I should know that this is the year of 2020 and there are 366 days (leap year). If it is 2019-03-30, then it should return 365 days (non-leap year).

Tried to search through the pandas dt documentation but can't seem to find any.

Thanks.

Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `is_leap_year` property of the `dt` accessor to check if the year is a leap year or not. Here is a function that does this:

```python
import pandas as pd

def days_in_year(date):
    date = pd.to_datetime(date)
    if date.dt.is_leap_year[0]:
        return 366
    else:
        return 365
```

You can use this function like this:

```python
print(days_in_year('2020-03-30'))  # Output: 366
print(days_in_year('2019-03-30'))  # Output: 365
```

This function first converts the input date to a Pandas datetime object. Then it checks if the year of this date is a leap year or not using the `is_leap_year` property. If it is a leap year, it returns 366, otherwise it returns 365.

Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `is_leap_year` property of the `dt` accessor to check if the year is a leap year or not. Here is an example:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a pandas series with your dates
dates = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']))

# Use the is_leap_year property to get a boolean series
# where True indicates a leap year and False a non-leap year
leap_years = dates.dt.is_leap_year

# Use the boolean series to select the number of days in the year
days_in_year = leap_years.replace({True: 366, False: 365})

print(days_in_year)
```

In this code, `dates.dt.is_leap_year` returns a series with the same index as `dates` where each value is `True` if the corresponding date is in a leap year and `False` otherwise. Then, `leap_years.replace({True: 366, False: 365})` replaces `True` with 366 and `False` with 365, giving the number of days in the year for each date.

Yes, you can calculate the total number of days in a year given a datetime format of YYYY-MM-DD in Pandas. You can use the `is_leap_year` property of the `dt` accessor to determine if the year is a leap year or not. Here is how you can do it:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Create a datetime series
dates = pd.Series(pd.to_datetime(['2020-03-30', '2019-03-30']))

# Calculate the total number of days in a year
days_in_year = dates.dt.is_leap_year.map({True: 366, False: 365})

print(days_in_year)
```

In this code, `dates.dt.is_leap_year` returns a boolean series that is `True` for leap years and `False` for non-leap years. Then, `map({True: 366, False: 365})` maps `True` to `366` and `False` to `365`, effectively giving you the total number of days in the year for each date in your series.
