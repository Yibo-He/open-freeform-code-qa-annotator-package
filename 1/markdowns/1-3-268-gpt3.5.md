I have a tfevent file already present on my Drive and I have successfully connected it to Google Colab. After searching within the issues of Tensorboard Github, I found that I had to set dom.serviceWorkers.enabled to True which I have done. But on Google Colab after performing the two steps:

1. %load_ext tensorboard
2. %tensorboard --logdir path/to/logs


I am getting a Error 403 on the second step cell:[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TuHkS.png)
I am using Firefox version 81.0.1 (64-bit) and my default mode is Private Window, so history and cache are cleared after I close all browser window.
Can someone help me with this?

The 403 error indicates that you do not have permission to access the resource. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as incorrect file permissions or authentication issues.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the file permissions: Make sure that the tfevent file has the correct permissions and that you have read access to it. You can check the file permissions by running the following command in a terminal:

```
ls -l path/to/logs
```

2. Check the log directory path: Make sure that the path to the log directory is correct and that it points to the directory where the tfevent file is located.

3. Clear browser cache: Try clearing your browser cache and cookies and then reload the page.

4. Use a different browser: Try using a different browser to see if the issue persists.

5. Check your network connection: Make sure that you have a stable network connection and that there are no firewall or proxy issues that are blocking your access to the resource.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to try reaching out to the Tensorboard Github community for further assistance.

The 403 error you are seeing indicates that you do not have permission to access the resource you are trying to view. This could be due to a number of reasons, including incorrect file permissions, authentication issues, or network connectivity problems.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the file permissions: Make sure that the tfevent file you are trying to access has the correct permissions set. You can do this by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Properties" or "Get Info" depending on your operating system. Make sure that the file is readable by the user running the TensorBoard process.

2. Check your authentication credentials: If you are accessing a resource that requires authentication, make sure that you have the correct credentials and that they are entered correctly. You may need to check with the resource owner to ensure that you have the correct credentials.

3. Check your network connectivity: If you are accessing the resource over a network, make sure that you have a stable and reliable connection. You may need to check with your network administrator to ensure that there are no network issues that could be causing the problem.

4. Try a different browser: If you are still having issues, try accessing the resource using a different browser. This can help to rule out any browser-specific issues that may be causing the problem.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to seek further assistance from the TensorBoard community or the resource owner.

The Error 403 indicates that you are not authorized to access the resource. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. Authentication: Check if you have the necessary permissions to access the resource. If you are using a private window, try using a regular window or try logging in to your Google account.

2. Firewall: Check if your network or firewall is blocking access to the resource. Try accessing the resource from a different network or disabling your firewall temporarily.

3. URL: Check if the URL you are using is correct and has the necessary permissions. Make sure that the URL is accessible from your current location.

4. Cache: Clear your browser cache and try accessing the resource again.

If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a different browser or contacting the support team for the resource you are trying to access.
