Got  my Django project on a Azure webapp, but when I call on SSH terminal:
> Python manage.py collectstatic
It says 252 files copied but my static files are not visible on my templates and static folder in wwwroot its empty...Here's my wwwroot structure:
```
wwwroot
|---Myproject
|---manage.py
|---oryx-manifest.toml
|---hostingstart.html
|---static //With all my static files
├── myapp
│   ├── migrations
│   ├── __pycache__
│   ├── static
|   |   |---Images
|   |   |   |--myimage.png
|   |   |   |--myimage2.png
│   └── templates
```

And this is my settings.py:
```
BASE_DIR = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'static/')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
STATICFILES_DIRS = (
   ('myapp', os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'myapp', 'static')),
)
STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
  'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
  'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
)
```

Any idea why or what am I doing wrong ?, does Azure collect different ?
EDIT> When I go to my website my images don´t show...Im calling them like this on template:
```
{% load static %}
<img src="{% static 'Images/myimage.png' %}" /><br>
```

EDIT 2 /////
In wwwroot creates indeed a folder with all my statics, but when I load my template they don´t show, in wen console I get this error for myimage.png and myimage2.png :
```
Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 (Not Found)
```

The issue you're experiencing seems to be related to the way Azure handles static files. Azure doesn't serve static files by default. You need to add a web.config file to your static files directory to enable this.

Here's a sample web.config file that you can use:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <staticContent>
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".svg" mimeType="image/svg+xml" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".woff" mimeType="application/font-woff" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".woff2" mimeType="application/font-woff" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".json" mimeType="application/json" />
      <mimeMap fileExtension=".png" mimeType="image/png" />
    </staticContent>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This file should be placed in the root of your static files directory. It tells IIS (the web server used by Azure) to serve files with the extensions .svg, .woff, .woff2, .json, and .png as static files.

Also, make sure that the path to your static files in your Django settings is correct and that the STATIC_ROOT setting points to the location where you want Django to collect static files for deployment.

If you're still having issues, you might want to consider using a separate static file hosting service like Azure Blob Storage or a CDN. This can provide better performance and scalability for your static files.

It seems like your static files are not being served correctly. In a production environment, Django doesn't serve static files itself, it leaves that job to the web server or a separate file server because it's more efficient.

Azure Web Apps are a bit different from traditional web servers. They do not serve static files in the same way. You need to configure your web app to serve static files.

Here's how you can do it:

1. You need to add a `web.config` file in your `wwwroot` directory. This file is used by Azure to configure the IIS server that runs your application.

2. In the `web.config` file, you need to add a rule to serve static files. Here's an example of how the `web.config` file should look:

```xml
<configuration>
  <system.webServer>
    <rewrite>
      <rules>
        <rule name="Static Files" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="^(static|media)/.*" />
          <action type="Rewrite" url="{R:0}" />
        </rule>
        <rule name="Configure Python" stopProcessing="true">
          <match url="(.*)" ignoreCase="false" />
          <conditions>
            <add input="{REQUEST_URI}" pattern="^/(static|media)/.*" ignoreCase="false" negate="true" />
          </conditions>
          <action type="Rewrite" url="handler.fcgi/{R:1}" appendQueryString="true" />
        </rule>
      </rules>
    </rewrite>
  </system.webServer>
</configuration>
```

This configuration file tells IIS to serve files from the `static` and `media` directories directly, and to pass all other requests to Django.

3. After adding the `web.config` file, you need to restart your web app for the changes to take effect.

Remember to replace `handler.fcgi` with the actual path to your Django application if it's different.

Also, please note that serving static files from a web application is not the best practice for performance and scalability reasons. In a production environment, you should consider serving static files from a dedicated static file server or a CDN.

The issue you're experiencing may be due to the way Azure handles static files. Azure doesn't serve static files by default. You need to configure it to do so.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Use Azure Storage for static files**: Azure Web Apps do not officially support serving your static files. You can use Azure Storage for serving your static files. You can create a storage account and then create a Blob container. After that, you can upload your static files to this Blob container and use the Blob service endpoint URL in your Django settings.

2. **Use WhiteNoise**: WhiteNoise is a Django library that simplifies static file serving. It works well with Azure and other cloud providers. You can install it using pip:

    ```
    pip install whitenoise
    ```

    Then, add it to your MIDDLEWARE in settings.py:

    ```python
    MIDDLEWARE = [
      'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware',
      'whitenoise.middleware.WhiteNoiseMiddleware',
      # ...
    ]
    ```

    And finally, add this line to your settings.py:

    ```python
    STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'whitenoise.storage.CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage'
    ```

3. **Check your static file paths**: Ensure that the file paths in your templates match the actual paths of your static files. The path should be relative to the static directory. For example, if your image is in a directory called images inside the static directory, the path should be 'images/myimage.png'.

4. **Check your STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT settings**: Ensure that STATIC_URL is set to '/static/' and STATIC_ROOT is set to the absolute path of the directory where collectstatic will copy your static files.

Remember to run `python manage.py collectstatic` again after making these changes.
