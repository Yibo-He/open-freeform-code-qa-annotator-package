I have installed tensorflow using:
`user:~$ sudo pip3 install --upgrade tensorflow-gpu`
```

However when I am trying to import tensorflow I am getting error about  libcublas.so.10.0:

What I am missing? and How can I resolve this?
Thanks

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that the TensorFlow library is unable to find the required shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required for TensorFlow to work with GPU acceleration.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the `libcublas.so.10.0` file is present in the CUDA installation directory. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   $ find /usr/local/cuda -name libcublas.so.10.0
   ```

   If the file is not found, it may be missing or not installed properly. In this case, you may need to reinstall CUDA.

2. If the file is found, you can try adding the CUDA library path to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

   ```
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
   ```

   This will add the CUDA library path to the beginning of the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable.

3. Try importing TensorFlow again and see if the issue is resolved.

If the above steps do not work, you can try reinstalling TensorFlow and CUDA to ensure that they are installed properly and all dependencies are met.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required by TensorFlow to run on GPU.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if the `libcublas.so.10.0` file is present in your system by running the following command:
```
$ find /usr/local -name libcublas.so.10.0
```
If the file is not found, it means that the CUDA toolkit is not installed properly or the installation directory is not added to the system path.

2. If the file is found, you can add the path to the CUDA toolkit to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable by running the following command:
```
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
This will add the CUDA library path to the system path.

3. Try importing TensorFlow again and see if the issue is resolved:
```
$ python3
>>> import tensorflow as tf
```

If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling the CUDA toolkit and TensorFlow. Make sure to follow the installation instructions carefully and verify that all dependencies are installed properly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that TensorFlow is unable to find the shared object file `libcublas.so.10.0`. This file is part of the CUDA toolkit and is required by TensorFlow to run on GPU.

To resolve this issue, you need to add the path to the CUDA library to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. You can do this by running the following command:

```
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This command adds the path `/usr/local/cuda/lib64` to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. This is the default installation path for CUDA on Ubuntu.

After running this command, try importing TensorFlow again. It should work without any errors.
