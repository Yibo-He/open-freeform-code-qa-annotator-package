I am working on a dataframe that looks like the following: (ID 2 added in edit)
```
+-------+----+------+------+
| Value | ID | Date | ID 2 |
+-------+----+------+------+
|     1 |  5 | 2012 | 111 |
|     1 |  5 | 2013 | 112 |
|     0 | 12 | 2017 | 113 |
|     0 | 12 | 2022 | 114 |
|     1 | 27 | 2005 | 115 |
|     1 | 27 | 2011 | 116 |
+-------+----+------+-----+
```

Only using rows with "Value" == "1" ("value is boolean), I would like to group the dataframe by ID and input the string "latest" to new (blank) column, giving the following output:
```
+-------+----+------+--------+
| Value | ID | Date | Latest |
+-------+----+------+--------+
|     1 |  5 | 2012 |        |
|     1 |  5 | 2013 | Latest |
|     0 | 12 | 2017 |        |
|     0 | 12 | 2022 |        |
|     1 | 27 | 2005 |        |
|     1 | 27 | 2011 | Latest |
+-------+----+------+--------+
```

The syntax of pandas is throwing me off as I am fairly new to Python.
In R I suppose I would be trying something like
```
df %>% select(Value == "1") %>% group_by(ID) %>% select(max(Date)
```

but I am not sure of the syntax in Pandas...I am trying to first select the subset of rows that meets the criteria "value == 1" by using
```
q = df.query('Value == 1')
my_query_index = q.index
my_query_index
```

This returns the index of all the rows but I am not sure how to incorporate this into the dataframe before grouping and filtering by max(date).
All help appreciated. Thank you.
EDIT: I used the pinned answer as following:
```
latest = df.query('Value==1').groupby("ID").max("Year").assign(Latest = "Latest")
df = pd.merge(df,latest,how="outer")
df
```

But I have since realized some of the max years are the same, i.e. there could be 4 rows, all with max year 2017. For the tiebreaker, I need to use the max ID 2 within groups. I have added `.groupby("ID 2").max("ID 2")` to the line of code, giving
```
latest = df.query('Value==1').groupby("ID").max("Year").groupby("ID 2").max("ID 2").assign(Latest = "Latest")
df = pd.merge(df,latest,how="outer")
df
```

but it is giving me a dataframe completely different than the one desired.
Thank you for your help, all is appreciated.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

You can use the `idxmax` function to find the index of the maximum date for each group. Then, use the `loc` function to assign the string "latest" to the new column at these indices. Here is how you can do it:

```python
# First, create a new column 'Latest' and initialize it with empty strings
df['Latest'] = ''

# Filter the dataframe where Value is 1
df1 = df[df['Value'] == 1]

# Find the index of the maximum date for each ID
idx = df1.groupby('ID')['Date'].idxmax()

# Assign the string 'latest' to the 'Latest' column at these indices
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

This will give you the desired output.

For your edited question, you can sort the dataframe by 'Date' and 'ID 2' in descending order before finding the index of the maximum date. This way, in case of a tie in 'Date', the maximum 'ID 2' will be selected.

```python
# Sort the dataframe by 'Date' and 'ID 2' in descending order
df1 = df1.sort_values(['Date', 'ID 2'], ascending=False)

# Find the index of the maximum date for each ID
idx = df1.groupby('ID')['Date'].idxmax()

# Assign the string 'latest' to the 'Latest' column at these indices
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

This will give you the desired output where the 'Latest' string is assigned to the row with the maximum 'Date' and 'ID 2' for each 'ID'.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the `idxmax` function to get the index of the maximum date for each group. Then, you can create a new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices.

Here is how you can do it:

```python
# Get the indices of the rows with the maximum date for each group
idx = df[df['Value'] == 1].groupby('ID')['Date'].idxmax()

# Create a new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices
df['Latest'] = ''
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

This will give you the desired output.

EDIT: If you want to use 'ID 2' as a tiebreaker, you can sort the dataframe by 'Date' and 'ID 2' before getting the index of the maximum date. Here is how you can do it:

```python
# Sort the dataframe by 'Date' and 'ID 2'
df_sorted = df.sort_values(['Date', 'ID 2'])

# Get the indices of the rows with the maximum date for each group
idx = df_sorted[df_sorted['Value'] == 1].groupby('ID').last().index

# Create a new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices
df['Latest'] = ''
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

This will give you the row with the maximum 'Date' and 'ID 2' for each group.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by first filtering the dataframe for rows where 'Value' is 1, then grouping by 'ID' and finding the index of the maximum 'Date' within each group. You can then create a new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices.

Here's how you can do it in pandas:

```python
# Filter dataframe for rows where 'Value' is 1
df_filtered = df[df['Value'] == 1]

# Group by 'ID' and find index of maximum 'Date' within each group
idx = df_filtered.groupby('ID')['Date'].idxmax()

# Create new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices
df['Latest'] = ''
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

Regarding your edit, if you want to break ties by using the maximum 'ID 2' within groups, you can sort the dataframe by 'Date' and 'ID 2' before finding the index of the maximum 'Date':

```python
# Filter dataframe for rows where 'Value' is 1
df_filtered = df[df['Value'] == 1]

# Sort by 'Date' and 'ID 2'
df_sorted = df_filtered.sort_values(['Date', 'ID 2'])

# Group by 'ID' and find index of maximum 'Date' within each group
idx = df_sorted.groupby('ID')['Date'].idxmax()

# Create new column 'Latest' and set its value to 'Latest' for these indices
df['Latest'] = ''
df.loc[idx, 'Latest'] = 'Latest'
```

This will ensure that if there are multiple rows with the same maximum 'Date' within a group, the one with the maximum 'ID 2' will be selected.
