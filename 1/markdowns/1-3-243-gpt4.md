I have a veary powerfull bot in discord (discord.py, PYTHON) and it can play music in voice channels. It gets the music from youtube (youtube_dl). It  but now it dosn't wanna work with any video.
I tried updataing youtube_dl but it still dosn't work
I searched everywhere but I still can't find a answer that might help me.
This is the Error: `Error: Unable to extract uploader id`
After and before the error log there is no more information.
Can anyone help?
I will leave some of the code that I use for my bot...
The youtube settup settings:
```
youtube_dl.utils.bug_reports_message = lambda: ''


ytdl_format_options = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'outtmpl': '%(extractor)s-%(id)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s',
    'restrictfilenames': True,
    'noplaylist': True,
    'nocheckcertificate': True,
    'ignoreerrors': False,
    'logtostderr': False,
    'quiet': True,
    'no_warnings': True,
    'default_search': 'auto',
    'source_address': '0.0.0.0',  # bind to ipv4 since ipv6 addresses cause issues sometimes
}

ffmpeg_options = {
    'options': '-vn',
}

ytdl = youtube_dl.YoutubeDL(ytdl_format_options)


class YTDLSource(discord.PCMVolumeTransformer):
    def __init__(self, source, *, data, volume=0.5):
        super().__init__(source, volume)

        self.data = data

        self.title = data.get('title')
        self.url = data.get('url')
        self.duration = data.get('duration')
        self.image = data.get("thumbnails")[0]["url"]
    @classmethod
    async def from_url(cls, url, *, loop=None, stream=False):
        loop = loop or asyncio.get_event_loop()
        data = await loop.run_in_executor(None, lambda: ytdl.extract_info(url, download=not stream))
        #print(data)

        if 'entries' in data:
            # take first item from a playlist
            data = data['entries'][0]
        #print(data["thumbnails"][0]["url"])
        #print(data["duration"])
        filename = data['url'] if stream else ytdl.prepare_filename(data)
        return cls(discord.FFmpegPCMAudio(filename, **ffmpeg_options), data=data)
```

Aproximately the command to run the audio (from my bot):
```
sessionChanel = message.author.voice.channel
await sessionChannel.connect()
url = matched.group(1)
player = await YTDLSource.from_url(url, loop=client.loop, stream=True)
sessionChannel.guild.voice_client.play(player, after=lambda e: print(
                                       f'Player error: {e}') if e else None)
```

The error message you're seeing, `Error: Unable to extract uploader id`, is a common issue with `youtube_dl` when YouTube changes something on their end. This can break the functionality of `youtube_dl` until it's updated to handle the changes.

However, you mentioned that you've already tried updating `youtube_dl` and it didn't solve the problem. This suggests that the issue might be with the specific videos you're trying to play, or with your usage of `youtube_dl`.

One possible solution is to use the `youtube-dl` fork called `yt-dlp` which is more maintained and updated. You can install it by running `pip install yt-dlp`. Then, you can replace `youtube_dl` with `yt_dlp` in your code.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```python
import yt_dlp

yt_dlp.utils.bug_reports_message = lambda: ''

ytdl_format_options = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'outtmpl': '%(extractor)s-%(id)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s',
    'restrictfilenames': True,
    'noplaylist': True,
    'nocheckcertificate': True,
    'ignoreerrors': False,
    'logtostderr': False,
    'quiet': True,
    'no_warnings': True,
    'default_search': 'auto',
    'source_address': '0.0.0.0',  # bind to ipv4 since ipv6 addresses cause issues sometimes
}

ffmpeg_options = {
    'options': '-vn',
}

ytdl = yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ytdl_format_options)

# rest of your code...
```

If this doesn't solve your problem, you might need to provide more information about the specific videos that are causing the issue. It's also possible that there's an issue with your Discord bot's permissions or with the Discord API itself.

The error message `Error: Unable to extract uploader id` is typically thrown by `youtube_dl` when it's unable to extract the uploader's ID from a YouTube video. This could be due to changes in the YouTube website's structure, which `youtube_dl` is not updated to handle.

However, `youtube_dl` has been discontinued and is no longer maintained. The official repository of `youtube_dl` recommends using `yt-dlp` instead, which is a fork of `youtube_dl` and is actively maintained.

Here's how you can install `yt-dlp`:

```bash
pip install yt-dlp
```

And here's how you can use `yt-dlp` in your code:

```python
import yt_dlp

ytdl_format_options = {
    'format': 'bestaudio/best',
    'outtmpl': '%(extractor)s-%(id)s-%(title)s.%(ext)s',
    'restrictfilenames': True,
    'noplaylist': True,
    'nocheckcertificate': True,
    'ignoreerrors': False,
    'logtostderr': False,
    'quiet': True,
    'no_warnings': True,
    'default_search': 'auto',
    'source_address': '0.0.0.0',  # bind to ipv4 since ipv6 addresses cause issues sometimes
}

ytdl = yt_dlp.YoutubeDL(ytdl_format_options)
```

Please replace `youtube_dl` with `yt_dlp` in your code and try again. This should resolve the issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing, `Error: Unable to extract uploader id`, is a common issue with `youtube_dl`. It usually occurs when YouTube changes something on their end, and `youtube_dl` needs to be updated to accommodate the changes.

You mentioned that you've already tried updating `youtube_dl`, but the error persists. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Update youtube_dl again**: Sometimes, the first update might not have worked correctly. Try updating `youtube_dl` again using pip:

    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade youtube_dl
    ```

2. **Check your youtube_dl version**: Make sure you're using the latest version of `youtube_dl`. You can check your version by running:

    ```bash
    youtube-dl --version
    ```

3. **Try a different video**: The issue might be with the specific video you're trying to download. Try using a different video URL to see if the problem persists.

4. **Check your code**: Make sure your code is correct and you're using `youtube_dl` correctly. The error might be due to a mistake in your code.

5. **Wait for a fix**: If none of the above solutions work, the issue might be with `youtube_dl` itself. In this case, you might have to wait for the developers to release a fix.

Also, please note that `youtube_dl` has been receiving DMCA takedowns and might not be the best choice for a long-term solution. You might want to consider using an alternative library or service for downloading YouTube videos.
