I have created different bins for each column and grouped the DataFrame based on these.
```
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

np.random.seed(100)
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(100, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'value'])

# for simplicity, I use the same bin here
bins = np.arange(-3, 4, 0.05)

df['a_bins'] = pd.cut(df['a'], bins=bins)
df['b_bins'] = pd.cut(df['b'], bins=bins)
df['c_bins'] = pd.cut(df['c'], bins=bins)
```

The output of `df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins']).size()` indicates the group length is 2685619.

## Calculate statistics of each group


Then, the statistics of each group are calculated like this:
```
%%timeit
df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins']).agg({'value':['mean']})

>>> 16.9 s ± 637 ms per loop (mean ± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)
```


## Expected output



1. Is it possible to speed this up?
2. The quicker method should also support finding the value by inputs of a, b, and c values, like this:


```
df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins']).agg({'value':['mean']}).loc[(-1.72, 0.32, 1.18)]

>>> -0.252436
```

The operation you're trying to perform is quite computationally expensive because you're creating a large number of groups due to the fine granularity of your bins. Here are a few suggestions to speed up the process:

1. **Reduce the number of bins**: If the precision of your bins is not critical, you could reduce the number of bins. This will directly reduce the number of groups and speed up the computation.

2. **Use `transform` instead of `agg`**: If you're performing the same operation on all columns, you can use `transform` instead of `agg`. This can be faster because it avoids the overhead of constructing a new DataFrame.

3. **Use `numba`**: If you're comfortable with using external libraries, you could use `numba`, a just-in-time compiler for Python that can significantly speed up numerical computations.

Here's an example of how you could use `transform`:

```python
df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins'])['value'].transform('mean')
```

And here's an example of how you could use `numba`:

```python
from numba import jit

@jit(nopython=True)
def fast_mean(data):
    return data.mean()

df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins']).agg({'value': fast_mean})
```

As for your second question, you can still use the `loc` function to find the mean value for a specific group as you did in your example. Just make sure to convert your input values to the corresponding bin labels.

The process you're using is already quite optimized for the task you're trying to accomplish. However, there are a few things you can try to speed up the process:

1. **Use fewer bins**: The number of groups is proportional to the cube of the number of bins (since you're grouping by three variables). Reducing the number of bins will reduce the number of groups and should speed up the process.

2. **Use `transform` instead of `agg`**: The `transform` method can be faster than `agg` in some cases. However, it returns a DataFrame that has the same length as the input, so you'll need to drop duplicates afterwards.

3. **Use a smaller data type**: If your data allows it, using a smaller data type can speed up the process. For example, if your values are integers, you can use the `int` data type instead of `float`.

4. **Use a different library**: Pandas is not always the fastest library for every task. If speed is a critical factor, you might want to try using a library like Dask, which is designed for parallel computing and can be faster than Pandas for some tasks.

Here's an example of how you might implement these suggestions:

```python
df['value'] = df['value'].astype('float32')  # use a smaller data type

# use fewer bins
bins = np.arange(-3, 4, 0.1)

df['a_bins'] = pd.cut(df['a'], bins=bins)
df['b_bins'] = pd.cut(df['b'], bins=bins)
df['c_bins'] = pd.cut(df['c'], bins=bins)

# use transform instead of agg
df['mean'] = df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins'])['value'].transform('mean')
df = df.drop_duplicates(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins'])
```

To find the mean value for specific a, b, and c values, you can use the `query` method:

```python
df.query('a_bins == -1.72 and b_bins == 0.32 and c_bins == 1.18')['mean']
```

Please note that these suggestions might not always result in a speedup, depending on the specifics of your data and your computing environment. It's always a good idea to test different approaches and see what works best for your specific situation.

The operation you're performing is quite complex, as it involves binning and grouping on multiple columns, and then calculating the mean for each group. This inherently involves a lot of computation, which is why it's taking a significant amount of time.

However, there are a few strategies you can use to speed up this operation:

1. **Use a smaller number of bins**: The number of groups is proportional to the cube of the number of bins (since you're grouping on three columns). Reducing the number of bins will therefore significantly reduce the number of groups, and hence the computation time.

2. **Use categorical data types**: Converting the binned columns to categorical data types can sometimes speed up groupby operations, as pandas can use a more efficient algorithm for categorical data.

3. **Use a more efficient aggregation function**: If you don't need the full flexibility of `agg`, you can use the `mean` method of the GroupBy object directly, which can be faster.

Here's how you can implement these strategies:

```python
bins = np.arange(-3, 4, 0.1)  # use fewer bins

df['a_bins'] = pd.cut(df['a'], bins=bins).astype('category')
df['b_bins'] = pd.cut(df['b'], bins=bins).astype('category')
df['c_bins'] = pd.cut(df['c'], bins=bins).astype('category')

%timeit df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins'])['value'].mean()
```

As for your second question, you can use the same method to find the mean value for a specific group. Just make sure to convert the input values to the corresponding bins first:

```python
a_bin = pd.cut([-1.72], bins=bins)[0]
b_bin = pd.cut([0.32], bins=bins)[0]
c_bin = pd.cut([1.18], bins=bins)[0]

df.groupby(['a_bins','b_bins','c_bins'])['value'].mean().loc[(a_bin, b_bin, c_bin)]
```

This will return the mean value for the group that the input values belong to.
