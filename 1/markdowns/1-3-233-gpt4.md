I'm a student, and I'm working on a project. The premise is that this program I'm working on takes as input the days (M-F) on which a student is enrolled, the number of hours per day they are enrolled, and which course they are enrolled in. Then, it queries a PostgreSQL database for the amount of progress hours (the "par value" of how long an assignment should take) for each module, and runs an algorithm, outputting the approximate due dates that students should shoot for in order to be done with their course by the deadline (which is set for the entire course rather than for individual assignments).
Now, I've had the database working in the past, but for the next deliverable I am overhauling the program to add support for students selecting their program, which will then populate an option menu with the appropriate courses. To do this, I need to add more test data. In the course of importing additional CSV files into a schema, an error arose:
> Can't load entity attributesReason:
Can't find target attribute [Sequence]
In the CSV file, "Sequence” is the name of one of the columns.
What does this error mean? And, how might I go about resolving it? I have looked over the CSV and I can’t find anything obviously wrong; the heading is there, along with all the associated data. I could in theory create a connection in DBeaver directly with the CSV files rather than importing their data into a database, and I’ve tested doing it that way and it does work as expected, but the Python module I’m using to query the database (psycopg2) doesn’t seem to be able to find it if I do it like that as opposed to using a traditional database (which is how I did it prior to altering my database).
Edit: In response to Adrian's comment, a sample of the CSV data is as follows:

I'm not importing this data into an existing table; rather, DBeaver has a feature where one can import a CSV without having an existing table, and a table with matching field headings and data types will be generated to place the data into. So, I do not have a schema to provide.
The DDL that is producing the error is below:
```
CREATE TABLE "Software Development".newtable (
    pk integer NULL,
    active boolean NULL,
    "Sequence" integer NULL,
    "name" varchar(32) NULL,
    "Number" integer NULL,
    hours real NULL,
    "Start Date" varchar(10) NULL,
    "Stop Date" varchar(10) NULL,
    "Modified When" varchar(22) NULL,
    "Modified By" varchar(19) NULL
);
```

In answer to Adrian's last question, DBeaver can link directly to a CSV file rather than importing its data into a table within a database. That was what I meant by it not being a "traditional database".

The error message "Can't find target attribute [Sequence]" suggests that the import process is not able to find a column named "Sequence" in the target table where it can import the data from the "Sequence" column of your CSV file.

However, from the DDL you provided, it seems like the "Sequence" column does exist in the table. One possible issue could be the case sensitivity. PostgreSQL is case sensitive for column names. If the column name is created with double quotes like "Sequence", then you have to always refer to it with double quotes and the exact case.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. Check the case sensitivity: Make sure that the case of the "Sequence" column in your CSV file matches exactly with the case of the "Sequence" column in your PostgreSQL table.

2. Check the CSV file format: Make sure that your CSV file is correctly formatted. There should not be any extra spaces before or after the column names and the data. Also, make sure that the data for the "Sequence" column is of the correct data type (integer).

3. Check the import settings: When importing the CSV file, make sure that you have selected the correct options. For example, if your CSV file has a header row, make sure that the "Header" option is checked.

4. Try creating a new table: If none of the above solutions work, try creating a new table with a different name and try importing the CSV file into this new table.

If you still encounter the same error, it would be helpful if you could provide more details about the import process, such as the exact steps you are following and the options you are selecting.

The error message "Can't find target attribute [Sequence]" suggests that the import process is not able to find a column named "Sequence" in the target table where the data from the CSV file is being imported. 

However, from the DDL you provided, it seems that the "Sequence" column does exist in the table. One possible issue could be the case sensitivity in PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is case-sensitive for column names. If the column name is written in any other form than it was created, it will not be recognized. In your DDL, "Sequence" is written with a capital "S" and is also enclosed in double quotes, which makes it case-sensitive.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the case of the column names in your CSV file. Make sure the case matches exactly with the column names in the table. If the column name in the CSV file is "sequence" (all lowercase), then it will not match with "Sequence" in the table.

2. Remove the double quotes from the column names in the DDL. When you enclose the column names in double quotes, PostgreSQL will treat them as case-sensitive. If you remove the double quotes, PostgreSQL will convert the column names to lowercase and it will not be case-sensitive.

3. If the case of the column names in the CSV file is different from the table, you can use the `AS` keyword in the `COPY` command to map the column names in the CSV file to the column names in the table.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to check if there are any hidden characters or spaces in the column names in the CSV file or in the table. You can use a text editor that shows hidden characters to check the CSV file. For the table, you can use the `pg_attribute` system catalog table to check the column names. Here is a query that you can use:

```sql
SELECT attname FROM pg_attribute 
WHERE attrelid = 'your_table_name'::regclass AND attnum > 0;
```

Replace 'your_table_name' with the name of your table. This query will return the column names in the table as they are stored in the database.

The error message "Can't find target attribute [Sequence]" suggests that the import process is not able to find a column named "Sequence" in the target table where the CSV data is being imported. 

However, from the DDL you provided, it seems like the "Sequence" column does exist in the table. One possible issue could be the case sensitivity. SQL is case-insensitive by default, but when you use double quotes around identifiers (like column names), it makes them case-sensitive. In your DDL, "Sequence" is written with a capital 'S', but if in your CSV file, it's written as "sequence" (all lowercase), it might cause this error.

Here are a few steps to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Case Sensitivity: Ensure that the case of the column names in your CSV file matches exactly with the column names in your table schema. If the column name in the CSV is "sequence" (all lowercase), then you should change the column name in your table schema to "sequence" (all lowercase) as well.

2. Whitespace: Check if there are any leading or trailing whitespaces in your column names in the CSV file or in the table schema. Whitespaces can sometimes be hard to spot but can cause issues during the import process.

3. Data Type: Ensure that the data type of the "Sequence" column in your table schema matches with the data in the CSV file. If the "Sequence" column in the CSV file contains non-integer values, it might cause issues during the import process.

4. CSV Format: Ensure that your CSV file is properly formatted. Sometimes, issues with the CSV file format (like incorrect delimiter, text qualifier, line separator, etc.) can cause issues during the import process.

If none of the above steps work, you might want to try importing the CSV data into a new table (with a different name) and see if you still get the same error. This can help you determine if the issue is with the specific table or with the CSV data.
