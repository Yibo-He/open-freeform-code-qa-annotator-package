I have a data.frame with 150 column names. For each column, I want to extract the maximum and minimum values (the rows repeat) and the row names of each maximum value. I have extracted the min and max values in another data.frame but don't know how to match them.
I have found functions that are very close for this, like for minimum values:
```
head(cars)
  speed dist
1     4    2
2     4   10
3     7    4
4     7   22
5     8   16
6     9   10

sapply(cars,which.min)

speed  dist 
    1     1
```

Here, it only gives the first index for minimum speed.
And I've tried with loops like:
```
for (i in (colnames(cars))){
  print(min(cars[[i]]))
}


[1] 4
[1] 2
```

But that just gives me the minimum values, and not if they are repeated and the rowname of each repeated value.
I want something like:
```
min.value  column  rowname   freq.times
4          speed      1,2        2
2          dist       1          1
```

Thanks and sorry if I have orthography mistakes. No native speaker

You can achieve this by using the `which` function in combination with the `==` operator to find the indices of the minimum values. Then, you can use these indices to get the row names. Here is a function that does this:

```r
get_min_values <- function(df) {
  result <- data.frame()
  for (col in names(df)) {
    min_val <- min(df[[col]])
    min_indices <- which(df[[col]] == min_val)
    rownames <- row.names(df[min_indices,])
    freq_times <- length(min_indices)
    result <- rbind(result, data.frame(min.value = min_val, column = col, rowname = paste(rownames, collapse = ","), freq.times = freq_times))
  }
  return(result)
}

get_min_values(cars)
```

This function iterates over each column in the dataframe, finds the minimum value, finds the indices of this minimum value, gets the row names of these indices, and counts the number of indices. It then adds this information to the result dataframe.

You can do the same for the maximum values:

```r
get_max_values <- function(df) {
  result <- data.frame()
  for (col in names(df)) {
    max_val <- max(df[[col]])
    max_indices <- which(df[[col]] == max_val)
    rownames <- row.names(df[max_indices,])
    freq_times <- length(max_indices)
    result <- rbind(result, data.frame(max.value = max_val, column = col, rowname = paste(rownames, collapse = ","), freq.times = freq_times))
  }
  return(result)
}

get_max_values(cars)
```

This function works the same way as the previous one, but finds the maximum values instead of the minimum values.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can achieve this by creating a function that will return a data frame with the minimum value, column name, row names where the minimum value is found, and the frequency of the minimum value. Then, you can use `lapply` to apply this function to each column of your data frame. Here's how you can do it:

```r
# Function to get min value, column name, row names and frequency
get_min_info <- function(x, col_name) {
  min_val <- min(x)
  row_names <- which(x == min_val)
  freq <- length(row_names)
  data.frame(min.value = min_val, column = col_name, rowname = list(row_names), freq.times = freq)
}

# Apply function to each column
result <- do.call(rbind, lapply(seq_along(cars), function(i) get_min_info(cars[[i]], names(cars)[i])))

# Print result
print(result)
```

This will give you a data frame where each row corresponds to a column in your original data frame, and the columns are the minimum value, column name, row names where the minimum value is found, and the frequency of the minimum value.

Note: The `rowname` column in the result is a list column. Each element of this column is a numeric vector with the row names where the minimum value is found. If you want to convert this to a character column with the row names separated by commas, you can do it like this:

```r
result$rowname <- sapply(result$rowname, function(x) paste(x, collapse = ","))
```

This will replace the list column with a character column where the row names are separated by commas.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by creating a function that will return a data frame with the minimum value, column name, row names where the minimum value is found, and the frequency of the minimum value. Then, you can use `lapply` to apply this function to each column of your data frame.

Here is an example:

```R
# Function to get min value, column name, row names and frequency
get_min_info <- function(x, col_name) {
  min_val <- min(x)
  min_rows <- which(x == min_val)
  freq <- length(min_rows)
  data.frame(min.value = min_val, column = col_name, rowname = list(min_rows), freq.times = freq)
}

# Apply the function to each column of the data frame
result <- do.call(rbind, lapply(seq_along(cars), function(i) get_min_info(cars[[i]], names(cars)[i])))

# Print the result
print(result)
```

This will give you a data frame where each row corresponds to a column in your original data frame, and the columns are the minimum value, column name, row names where the minimum value is found, and the frequency of the minimum value.

Note that the `rowname` column is a list column, meaning that each element of this column is a vector of row names. This is necessary because there can be multiple row names where the minimum value is found.

If you want to do the same for the maximum values, you can create a similar function `get_max_info` and replace `min` with `max` and `which.min` with `which.max`.
