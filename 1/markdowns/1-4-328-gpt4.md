I am trying to use `pivot_longer`. However, I am not sure how to use `names_sep` or `names_pattern` to solve this.
```
dat <- tribble(
     ~group,  ~BP,  ~HS,  ~BB, ~lowerBP, ~upperBP, ~lowerHS, ~upperHS, ~lowerBB, ~upperBB,
        "1", 0.51, 0.15, 0.05,     0.16,     0.18,      0.5,     0.52,     0.14,     0.16,
      "2.1", 0.67, 0.09, 0.06,     0.09,     0.11,     0.66,     0.68,     0.08,      0.1,
      "2.2", 0.36, 0.13, 0.07,     0.12,     0.15,     0.34,     0.38,     0.12,     0.14,
      "2.3", 0.09, 0.17, 0.09,     0.13,     0.16,     0.08,     0.11,     0.15,     0.18,
      "2.4", 0.68, 0.12, 0.07,     0.12,     0.14,     0.66,     0.69,     0.11,     0.13,
        "3", 0.53, 0.15, 0.06,     0.14,     0.16,     0.52,     0.53,     0.15,     0.16)
```

Desired output (First row from wide data)
```
group names   values lower upper
   1    BP      0.51  0.16  0.18
   1    HS      0.15  0.5   0.52
   1    BB      0.05  0.14  0.16
```

You can use the `pivot_longer` function from the `tidyverse` package to reshape your data from wide to long format. The `names_pattern` argument allows you to specify a regular expression that will be used to split the column names. 

Here's how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyverse)

dat_long <- dat %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -group,
    names_to = c(".value", "names"),
    names_pattern = "(lower|upper|)(.*)"
  )

dat_long
```

In the `names_pattern`, we use a regular expression to match either "lower", "upper", or nothing (indicated by `|`), followed by any characters (indicated by `.*`). The parentheses `()` create capture groups, which are used to fill the `names_to` vector. The `.value` in `names_to` indicates that the part of the column name matched by the corresponding capture group in `names_pattern` should be used as the name of the column in the output.

This will give you a long format data frame where the "BP", "HS", and "BB" values are in a single column, and the "lower" and "upper" values are in separate columns.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use `pivot_longer` with `names_pattern` to achieve this. `names_pattern` allows you to specify a regular expression that will be used to separate the column names into multiple variables. In your case, you can use a regular expression that separates the column names into the variable name and the type of value (value, lower, upper).

Here is how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyr)

dat_long <- dat %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -group, 
    names_to = c(".value", "names"), 
    names_pattern = "(lower|upper)?(.*)"
  )

dat_long
```

In the `names_pattern`, `(lower|upper)?(.*)` is a regular expression that matches either "lower" or "upper" at the start of the column name (the `?` makes this optional, so it also matches column names that start with neither), and then any characters after that. The parentheses `()` create groups that are used to fill the `names_to` variables: the first group (matching "lower" or "upper") fills `.value`, and the second group (matching any characters after "lower" or "upper") fills "names".

This will create a long format of your data where each row represents one observation, with separate columns for the group, the variable name (BP, HS, BB), and the type of value (value, lower, upper).

You can use `pivot_longer` from the `tidyverse` package to reshape your data. The `names_pattern` argument allows you to specify a regular expression that will be used to separate the column names into multiple variables. In your case, you can use a regular expression to separate the column names into the variable name and the type of value (value, lower, upper).

Here is how you can do it:

```r
library(tidyverse)

dat_long <- dat %>%
  pivot_longer(
    cols = -group, 
    names_to = c(".value", "names"), 
    names_pattern = "(lower|upper)?(.*)"
  )

dat_long
```

In the `names_pattern`, `(lower|upper)?(.*)` is a regular expression where `(lower|upper)?` matches either "lower" or "upper" at the start of the column name, and `(.*)` matches the rest of the column name. The `?` makes the "lower" or "upper" optional, so it also matches column names that start directly with the variable name.

The `names_to = c(".value", "names")` argument tells `pivot_longer` to use the first part of the column name (matched by `(lower|upper)?`) as the name of the new value column, and the second part of the column name (matched by `(.*)`) as the name of the new variable column.

The `cols = -group` argument tells `pivot_longer` to reshape all columns except the "group" column.

The result is a long format data frame where each row represents one observation, with a separate row for each variable and group.
