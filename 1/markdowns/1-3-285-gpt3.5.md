Can someone explain me what `random_state` means in below example?
```
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X, y = np.arange(10).reshape((5, 2)), range(5)


X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    X, y, test_size=0.33, random_state=42)
```

Why is it hard coded to 42?

In the `train_test_split` function, `random_state` is used to set the seed for the random number generator. This is important because when we split the data into training and testing sets, we want to ensure that the split is reproducible. 

By setting `random_state` to a fixed value (in this case, 42), we can ensure that every time we run the code, we get the same split of the data into training and testing sets. This is useful for debugging and testing purposes.

The value of 42 is arbitrary and has no special meaning. It is often used as a default value in examples and tutorials because it is a reference to the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, in which 42 is famously described as the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything".

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

`random_state` is a parameter in the `train_test_split` function that is used to set the random seed for the random number generator. This is important because when you split your data into training and testing sets, you want to ensure that the split is reproducible. By setting the `random_state` parameter to a fixed value, you can ensure that the same random split is generated every time you run the code.

In the example you provided, the `random_state` parameter is set to 42. This is an arbitrary value that was chosen by the developer who wrote the code. The number 42 is often used as a default value for random seeds in programming, as it has some cultural significance in the science fiction novel "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". However, the specific value of 42 is not important - what is important is that the same value is used consistently throughout your code to ensure reproducibility.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

`random_state` is a parameter in the `train_test_split` function that allows you to specify the random seed used by the random number generator. This is important because when you split your data into training and testing sets, you want to ensure that the same split is obtained every time you run your code. 

By setting `random_state` to a specific value (in this case, 42), you are ensuring that the same random split is obtained every time you run the code. This is useful for reproducibility and for comparing results across different runs of the code.

The value 42 is often used as a default value for `random_state` in examples and tutorials because it is a reference to the book "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" by Douglas Adams, in which the number 42 is famously described as the "Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything". However, in practice, any integer value can be used for `random_state`.
