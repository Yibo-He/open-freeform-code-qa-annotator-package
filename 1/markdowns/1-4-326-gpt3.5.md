I have strings like:
```
string <- "1, 2, \"something, else\""
```

I want to use `tidyr::separate_rows()` with `sep==","`, but the comma inside the quoted portion of the string is tripping me up. I'd like to remove the comma between something and else (but only this comma).
Here's a more complex toy example:
```
string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

string
#[1] "1, 2, \"something, else\""                   
#[2] "3, 5, \"more, more, more\""                  
#[3] "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\""
```

I want to get rid of all commas inside the embedded quotations. Desired output:
```
[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```

You can use regular expressions to replace the commas inside the quoted portions of the string with a different character (e.g. a semicolon), then use `separate_rows()` with `sep==","`, and finally replace the semicolons back to commas. Here's the code to do that:

```
library(tidyr)

string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

# Replace commas inside quotes with semicolons
string <- gsub("(\"[^\"]*),([^\\\"]*\")", "\\1;\\2", string)

# Separate rows using commas
string <- separate_rows(string, sep = ",")

# Replace semicolons back to commas
string <- gsub(";", ",", string)

string
#[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
#[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
#[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use regular expressions to replace the commas inside the quoted portions of the string with a different character (e.g. semicolon), and then use `separate_rows()` with `sep==","`. Here's some code that should work:

```
library(tidyr)

string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

# Replace commas inside quotes with semicolons
string <- gsub("(\"[^\"]*),([^\\\"]*\")", "\\1;\\2", string)

# Separate rows using commas
string <- separate_rows(string, sep = ",")

# Replace semicolons back to commas inside quotes
string <- gsub("(\"[^\"]*);([^\\\"]*\")", "\\1,\\2", string)

string
#[1] "1"                    "2"                    "\"something, else\""  
#[4] "3"                    "5"                    "\"more, more, more\""
#[7] "6"                    "\"commas, are fun\""   "\"no, they are not\"" 

# Remove leading/trailing whitespace
string <- trimws(string)

# Replace semicolons with spaces
string <- gsub(";", " ", string)

string
#[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
#[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
#[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```

Note that this code assumes that there are no escaped quotes inside the quoted portions of the string (e.g. `"this is a quote: \"hello\""`). If there are, the regular expression will need to be modified to handle them properly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use regular expressions to replace the commas inside the quoted portions of the string with a different character (e.g. underscore), and then use `separate_rows()` with `sep==","`. Here's an example code that achieves this:

```
library(tidyr)

string <- c("1, 2, \"something, else\"", "3, 5, \"more, more, more\"", "6, \"commas, are fun\", \"no, they are not\"")

# Replace commas inside quotes with underscores
string_clean <- gsub("(\"[^\"]*),([^\".]*\")", "\\1_\\2", string)

# Separate rows using commas
string_separated <- separate_rows(string_clean, sep = ",")

# Replace underscores back to commas inside quotes
string_final <- gsub("(\"[^\"]*)_([^\".]*\")", "\\1,\\2", string_separated)

string_final
#[1] "1, 2, \"something else\""                  
#[2] "3, 5, \"more more more\""                  
#[3] "6, \"commas are fun\", \"no they are not\""
```

The regular expression `"(\"[^\"]*),([^\".]*\")"` matches a quote, followed by any number of non-quote characters, followed by a comma, followed by any number of non-quote and non-period characters, followed by a quote. The replacement string `"\\1_\\2"` replaces the comma with an underscore, while keeping the quotes intact. 

After separating the rows using `separate_rows()`, we use another regular expression `"(\"[^\"]*)_([^\".]*\")"` to match a quote, followed by any number of non-quote characters, followed by an underscore, followed by any number of non-quote and non-period characters, followed by a quote. The replacement string `"\\1,\\2"` replaces the underscore with a comma, while keeping the quotes intact.
