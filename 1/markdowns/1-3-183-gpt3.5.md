Given a simple binary mask (e.g. the boundary of a rectangle).

![binary mask](https://i.stack.imgur.com/w3kmz.png)

How can I use a polygon to get the x-y coordinates?

This is what I have tried so far:

```
coords = np.transpose(np.nonzero(mask))
```


However, this approach generates a filled object and not the desired boundary.

```
plt.plot(coords[:, 1], coords[:,0])
```

Basically, I want a list of x-y coordinates of the white pixels to use this list to re-draw the rectangle (not filled).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To get the boundary of the rectangle, you can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage` library. Here's an example code snippet:

```
from skimage import measure

# assuming 'mask' is your binary mask
contours = measure.find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# get the largest contour (assuming it's the boundary of the rectangle)
boundary = max(contours, key=len)

# plot the boundary
plt.plot(boundary[:, 1], boundary[:, 0])
```

This should give you the x-y coordinates of the boundary of the rectangle. Note that the `find_contours` function returns a list of contours, where each contour is a list of (y, x) coordinates. The `max` function is used to get the largest contour, which should be the boundary of the rectangle.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To get the boundary of the rectangle, you can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage` library. Here's an example code:

```python
from skimage import measure

# assuming "mask" is your binary mask
contours = measure.find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# get the first contour (assuming there's only one)
boundary = contours[0]

# plot the boundary
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(boundary[:, 1], boundary[:, 0])
plt.show()
```

This should give you the desired boundary of the rectangle. The `find_contours` function finds all the contours in the binary mask, and each contour is represented as a list of (y, x) coordinates. Since you only have one contour (the boundary), you can just take the first one.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To get the boundary of the rectangle, you can use the `find_contours` function from the `skimage` library. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
from skimage import measure

# assuming your binary mask is stored in the variable 'mask'
contours = measure.find_contours(mask, 0.5)

# the 'contours' variable now contains a list of arrays, where each array
# represents the x-y coordinates of a single contour
# in this case, there should only be one contour (the boundary of the rectangle)
boundary_coords = contours[0]

# plot the boundary
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.plot(boundary_coords[:, 1], boundary_coords[:, 0])
plt.show()
```

This should give you the desired output, which is the boundary of the rectangle:
