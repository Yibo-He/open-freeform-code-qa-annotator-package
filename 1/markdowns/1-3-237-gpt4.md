I have a function that takes a link as input, then requests values, then puts them in an available list, this function doesn't return anything, how can I write test cases for them?
For example:
```
list = []
def myfunc(link):
    [code block]
    list.append(value)
```

Testing a function that doesn't return anything can be a bit tricky, but it's not impossible. In your case, the function is modifying a global list. So, you can check the state of this list before and after the function call to verify if the function is working as expected. Here's an example of how you can do it:

```python
import unittest

list = []

def myfunc(link):
    # [code block]
    list.append(value)

class TestMyFunc(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Clear the list before each test
        list.clear()

    def test_myfunc(self):
        # Test with a specific link
        myfunc('http://example.com')
        # Check if the list contains the expected value
        self.assertEqual(list, [expected_value])

    def test_myfunc_with_different_link(self):
        # Test with a different link
        myfunc('http://another-example.com')
        # Check if the list contains the expected value
        self.assertEqual(list, [another_expected_value])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, `unittest` is a built-in Python module for testing your code. `setUp` is a special method that is called before each test. We use it to clear the list so that each test starts with an empty list. Then we have two test cases: `test_myfunc` and `test_myfunc_with_different_link`. In each test case, we call `myfunc` with a specific link and then check if the list contains the expected value.

Please replace `expected_value` and `another_expected_value` with the actual values you expect the function to append to the list for the given links.

Remember, the key to testing functions that don't return anything is to check the side effects of the function (i.e., how the function changes the state of the program). In this case, the side effect is the change in the global list.

Testing a function that doesn't return anything can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible. You can test the side effects of the function, in this case, the change in the list. Here's an example of how you might write a test case for this function:

```python
import unittest

list = []

def myfunc(link):
    # [code block]
    # list.append(value)
    pass  # replace this with your actual code

class TestMyFunc(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Clear the list before each test
        list.clear()

    def test_myfunc(self):
        # Test with a specific link
        myfunc('http://example.com')
        # Check that the list contains the expected result
        self.assertEqual(list, ['expected result'])

    def test_myfunc_with_different_link(self):
        # Test with a different link
        myfunc('http://another-example.com')
        # Check that the list contains the different expected result
        self.assertEqual(list, ['different expected result'])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, `setUp` is used to clear the list before each test, ensuring that the tests don't interfere with each other. Then, in each test, `myfunc` is called with a specific link, and `assertEqual` is used to check that the list contains the expected result.

Remember to replace `'http://example.com'`, `'http://another-example.com'`, `'expected result'`, and `'different expected result'` with the actual values you expect based on the link and the code block in `myfunc`.

Testing a function that doesn't return anything can be a bit tricky, but it's definitely possible. In your case, you can test the function by checking the state of the list before and after the function call. Here's a simple example of how you might do this:

```python
import unittest

list = []

def myfunc(link):
    # [code block]
    list.append(value)

class TestMyFunc(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        # Clear the list before each test
        list.clear()

    def test_myfunc(self):
        # Assume that the function should add a specific value to the list
        expected_value = 'some value'
        myfunc('some link')
        self.assertIn(expected_value, list)

    def test_myfunc_with_multiple_calls(self):
        # Assume that the function should add a specific value to the list each time it's called
        expected_value = 'some value'
        myfunc('some link')
        myfunc('some link')
        self.assertEqual(list.count(expected_value), 2)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

In this example, `setUp` is a special method that gets called before each test. It's used to set up any state that's needed for the tests. In this case, it's used to clear the list so that each test starts with an empty list.

The `test_myfunc` method is a test case that checks whether the expected value is in the list after calling `myfunc`.

The `test_myfunc_with_multiple_calls` method is another test case that checks whether the list contains the expected value twice after calling `myfunc` twice.

Please replace 'some value' and 'some link' with the actual value and link you are testing with.
