Community of stackoverflow:
I have a list "rest" which is the following:
```
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
```

I have another list which is b:
```
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

And I have a "last" list:
```
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

I have to replace the first 4 elements in b with the elements in rest. How can I replace the elements in last according to the matches with b to get the rest elements?
for example:
```
5   7   11   4   #elements from rest
b= [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

to get last list as the following:
```
last=[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]  #elements that matched with b were replaced by rest
```

How can I do this?

You can use slicing to replace the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`. Then, you can loop through `last` and replace any element that matches with an element in `b` with the corresponding element in `rest`.

Here's the code to do this:

```
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Replace first 4 elements in b with elements in rest
b[:4] = rest

# Loop through last and replace matching elements with elements in rest
for i in range(len(last)):
    if last[i] in b:
        last[i] = rest[b.index(last[i])]

print(last)
```

This will output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use list slicing and list comprehension to achieve this. Here's an example code:

```
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Replace first 4 elements in b with elements in rest
b[:4] = rest

# Replace elements in last according to matches with b
last = [rest[b.index(i)] if i in b else i for i in last]

print(last)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

Explanation:
- `b[:4] = rest` replaces the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest`.
- `[rest[b.index(i)] if i in b else i for i in last]` creates a new list where each element in `last` is replaced by the corresponding element in `rest` if it exists in `b`, otherwise it remains the same. The `if i in b` condition checks if the element in `last` exists in `b`, and `rest[b.index(i)]` gets the corresponding element in `rest` using the index of the element in `b`.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use list slicing and list comprehension to achieve this. Here's an example code:

```
rest = [5, 7, 11, 4]
b = [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last = [33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# replace first 4 elements in b with elements in rest
b[:4] = rest

# replace elements in last according to matches with b
last = [rest[b.index(x)] if x in b else x for x in last]

print(last)
```

Output:
```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

In the above code, we first replace the first 4 elements in `b` with the elements in `rest` using list slicing. Then, we use list comprehension to replace the elements in `last` according to matches with `b`. We check if an element in `last` is present in `b`, and if it is, we replace it with the corresponding element from `rest`. If it is not present in `b`, we keep the original element from `last`.
