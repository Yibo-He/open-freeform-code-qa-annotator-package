While pushing a commit to GitHub yesterday, I received an email from the GitHub team:
> Basic authentication using a password to Git is deprecated and will soon no longer work. Visit [https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/](https://github.blog/2020-12-15-token-authentication-requirements-for-git-operations/) for more information around suggested workarounds and removal dates.Thanks,

I don't understand a word of the help page...
I did create a more secure access token a few months ago when they first announced the change in authentification, and entered it in the terminal of my mac. I thought that would be it. My question is: 
Thanks in advance for your help,
Rosalie

Hi Rosalie,

The email you received is about a change in how GitHub is handling authentication. They are moving away from password-based authentication for Git operations and are now requiring token-based authentication.

Since you mentioned that you already created a personal access token a few months ago, you should be all set. However, the error message might be appearing because your Git client is still trying to authenticate using your old credentials (username and password).

Here's how you can update your credentials on your Mac:

1. Open Terminal.
2. Enter the following command to bring up the keychain access: `open /Applications/Utilities/Keychain\ Access.app/`
3. In the search bar in Keychain Access, search for `github.com`.
4. Find the internet password for `github.com` and delete it.
5. The next time you try to push to GitHub from your terminal, it will prompt you for your username and password. Here, enter your GitHub username and use the personal access token you created as the password.

This should resolve the issue. If you continue to have problems, please let me know.

Best,
Your Assistant

Hello Rosalie,

It seems like you're having trouble with the new authentication requirements for Git operations on GitHub. No worries, I'm here to help.

Since you've already created a personal access token, you're halfway there. The issue might be that Git is still trying to use your old credentials (username and password) which are stored in your computer's credential storage.

Here's how you can update your credentials on your Mac:

1. Open Terminal.

2. Enter the following command to bring up the Git credential helper:

   ```
   git config --global --edit
   ```

3. In the text editor that opens, find the line that says `[credential]` and the line below it that says `helper = osxkeychain`. If these lines don't exist, you can add them at the end of the file.

4. Save and close the file.

5. Now, when you try to push to GitHub, it should prompt you for your username and password. Enter your GitHub username and, instead of entering your password, use the personal access token you created.

6. If it doesn't prompt you for your username and password, you might need to delete your old credentials from the keychain. To do this, open Keychain Access (you can find it using Spotlight), find the GitHub entry under login, and delete it.

After doing this, the next time you push to GitHub, it should prompt you for your username and password. Remember to use your personal access token as your password.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,
Your Assistant

Hello Rosalie,

The email you received is about a change in the way GitHub authenticates your Git operations. Previously, you could use your GitHub username and password to authenticate your Git operations. However, this method is being deprecated and will soon no longer work. 

Instead, GitHub is moving towards using personal access tokens for authentication. These tokens are more secure and can be easily revoked if needed. You mentioned that you have already created a personal access token a few months ago, which is great.

Now, you need to use this token instead of your password when authenticating with GitHub. Here's how you can do it:

1. When you are prompted for a password after you have entered your username, enter your personal access token instead of your password.

2. If you have saved your credentials (username and password) in your Git client, you need to update them. Replace your password with the personal access token. The way to do this depends on the Git client you are using. If you're using the terminal on your Mac, you can use the `git credential-osxkeychain` command to store your credentials.

3. If you are using the command line and you have the `credential.helper` configuration set, the next time you `git push`, you'll be asked for your username and password. In the password field, just enter your personal access token.

Remember, your personal access token is like a password. Keep it secret, keep it safe.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Best,
Your Assistant
