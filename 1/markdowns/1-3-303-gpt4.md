I am trying to install the following version of TensorFlow-GPU because the author of gitrepo has suggested it [here](https://github.com/jgraving/DeepPoseKit/issues/12#issuecomment-540031912). 

```

How do I fix this installation issue?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message you're seeing is because the `wrapt` package was installed by a system package manager (`yum`, `apt`, etc.), and `pip` is trying to uninstall it to install a different version. This is a common issue when using system Python.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Create a new Python virtual environment. This is a good practice to isolate your Python environment from the system Python and avoid conflicts with system packages. You can use `venv` (built-in since Python 3.3) or `conda` since you seem to be using Anaconda.

   For `venv`, you can do:

   ```
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate
   ```

   For `conda`, you can do:

   ```
   conda create -n myenv python=3.6
   conda activate myenv
   ```

   Replace `myenv` with whatever you want to name your environment.

2. Once you're in the virtual environment, try installing TensorFlow again:

   ```
   pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
   ```

This should install TensorFlow and its dependencies in the virtual environment without conflicting with system packages.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is because the `wrapt` package was installed using a method other than `pip`, and `pip` is unable to uninstall it. 

You can try to force reinstall `wrapt` using `pip` with the `--ignore-installed` flag. This will ignore the check for installed version of `wrapt` and overwrite it.

Here is the command:

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed wrapt
```

After this, you should be able to install `tensorflow-gpu`:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

If this doesn't work, you may need to manually remove the `wrapt` package. 

You can find the location of the package with the following command:

```bash
python -c "import wrapt; print(wrapt.__path__)"
```

Then, you can manually delete the package and reinstall it using `pip`. 

Please note that manually deleting Python packages can potentially break your environment, so proceed with caution. If possible, it's recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid such issues.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is indicating that `wrapt` was installed by a method other than `pip`, and `pip` is refusing to uninstall it because it might break other things that depend on it.

You can try to force reinstall `wrapt` by using the `--ignore-installed` flag. This will ignore the request to uninstall the previous package. Here is the command:

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed wrapt
```

After that, you can try to install `tensorflow-gpu` again:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu~=1.14
```

If the above doesn't work, you might want to consider using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with system packages. You can use `conda` to create a new environment:

```bash
conda create -n tf_gpu tensorflow-gpu=1.14
conda activate tf_gpu
```

This will create a new environment named `tf_gpu` and install `tensorflow-gpu` version 1.14 in it. You can then activate the environment with `conda activate tf_gpu` and run your code within this environment.
