This is a question from Codewars:
Complete the method/function so that it converts dash/underscore delimited words into camel casing. The first word within the output should be capitalized only if the original word was capitalized (known as Upper Camel Case, also often referred to as Pascal case).

The input test cases are as follows:

```
test.describe("Testing function to_camel_case")
test.it("Basic tests")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case(''), '', "An empty string was provided but not returned")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"), "theStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') did not return correct value")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"), "TheStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') did not return correct value")
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("A-B-C"), "ABC", "to_camel_case('A-B-C') did not return correct value")
```


This is what I've tried so far:

```
def to_camel_case(text):
    str=text
    str=str.replace(' ','')
    for i in str:
        if ( str[i] == '-'):
            str[i]=str.replace('-','')
            str[i+1].toUpperCase()
        elif ( str[i] == '_'):
            str[i]=str.replace('-','')
            str[i+1].toUpperCase()
    return str
```


It passes the first two tests but not the main ones :

```
test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("the_stealth_warrior"), "theStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('the_stealth_warrior') did not return correct value")
    test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("The-Stealth-Warrior"), "TheStealthWarrior", "to_camel_case('The-Stealth-Warrior') did not return correct value")
    test.assert_equals(to_camel_case("A-B-C"), "ABC", "to_camel_case('A-B-C') did not return correct value")
```


What am I doing wrong?

The problem with your current approach is that you're trying to modify the string in place, which is not possible in Python as strings are immutable. Also, the `toUpperCase()` method doesn't exist in Python, you should use `upper()` instead.

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ''
    else:
        text = text.replace('-', ' ').replace('_', ' ')
        words = text.split()
        for i in range(1, len(words)):
            words[i] = words[i].capitalize()
        return ''.join(words)
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. If it's not, it replaces all dashes and underscores with spaces, splits the string into words, capitalizes all words except the first one, and then joins them back together without spaces.

This function should pass all your tests.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue with your code is that you're trying to replace the characters in the string directly, which is not allowed in Python because strings are immutable. Also, the `toUpperCase()` method is not valid in Python, you should use `upper()` instead.

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    res = []
    capitalize_next = False
    for char in text:
        if char in ['-', '_']:
            capitalize_next = True
        elif capitalize_next:
            res.append(char.upper())
            capitalize_next = False
        else:
            res.append(char)
    return ''.join(res)
```

This function works by iterating over each character in the input string. If the character is a dash or underscore, it sets a flag (`capitalize_next`) to True. On the next iteration, if `capitalize_next` is True, it appends the uppercase version of the character to the result list and resets the flag. If the character is not a dash, underscore, or a character to be capitalized, it is appended to the result list as is. Finally, it joins the list of characters back into a string and returns it.

The issue with your current approach is that you're trying to modify the string in place, which is not possible in Python as strings are immutable. Also, the `toUpperCase()` method does not exist in Python. The correct method is `upper()`. 

Here's a corrected version of your function:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    if not text:
        return ''
    else:
        words = text.replace('-', '_').split('_')
        return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
```

This function first checks if the input string is empty. If it is, it returns an empty string. If it's not, it replaces all dashes with underscores and splits the string into a list of words. Then it returns the first word concatenated with the rest of the words, each capitalized. 

This should pass all the tests.
