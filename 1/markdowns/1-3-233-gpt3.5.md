I'm a student, and I'm working on a project. The premise is that this program I'm working on takes as input the days (M-F) on which a student is enrolled, the number of hours per day they are enrolled, and which course they are enrolled in. Then, it queries a PostgreSQL database for the amount of progress hours (the "par value" of how long an assignment should take) for each module, and runs an algorithm, outputting the approximate due dates that students should shoot for in order to be done with their course by the deadline (which is set for the entire course rather than for individual assignments).
Now, I've had the database working in the past, but for the next deliverable I am overhauling the program to add support for students selecting their program, which will then populate an option menu with the appropriate courses. To do this, I need to add more test data. In the course of importing additional CSV files into a schema, an error arose:
> Can't load entity attributesReason:
Can't find target attribute [Sequence]
In the CSV file, "Sequence” is the name of one of the columns.
What does this error mean? And, how might I go about resolving it? I have looked over the CSV and I can’t find anything obviously wrong; the heading is there, along with all the associated data. I could in theory create a connection in DBeaver directly with the CSV files rather than importing their data into a database, and I’ve tested doing it that way and it does work as expected, but the Python module I’m using to query the database (psycopg2) doesn’t seem to be able to find it if I do it like that as opposed to using a traditional database (which is how I did it prior to altering my database).
Edit: In response to Adrian's comment, a sample of the CSV data is as follows:

I'm not importing this data into an existing table; rather, DBeaver has a feature where one can import a CSV without having an existing table, and a table with matching field headings and data types will be generated to place the data into. So, I do not have a schema to provide.
The DDL that is producing the error is below:
```
CREATE TABLE "Software Development".newtable (
    pk integer NULL,
    active boolean NULL,
    "Sequence" integer NULL,
    "name" varchar(32) NULL,
    "Number" integer NULL,
    hours real NULL,
    "Start Date" varchar(10) NULL,
    "Stop Date" varchar(10) NULL,
    "Modified When" varchar(22) NULL,
    "Modified By" varchar(19) NULL
);
```

In answer to Adrian's last question, DBeaver can link directly to a CSV file rather than importing its data into a table within a database. That was what I meant by it not being a "traditional database".

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message you are seeing suggests that the PostgreSQL database is having trouble finding the "Sequence" column in your CSV file. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a formatting issue or a mismatch between the column names in the CSV file and the column names in the database schema.

One thing you could try is to explicitly specify the column names in your CSV file when you import it into the database. This can help ensure that the column names in the CSV file match the column names in the database schema. You can do this by using the "HEADER" option when you run the "COPY" command to import the CSV file. For example:

```
COPY newtable (pk, active, "Sequence", name, "Number", hours, "Start Date", "Stop Date", "Modified When", "Modified By") FROM '/path/to/your/csv/file.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

Note that the column names in the "COPY" command should match the column names in your database schema, including any capitalization or special characters.

If this doesn't work, you may want to double-check the formatting of your CSV file to make sure there are no hidden characters or other issues that could be causing the problem. You could also try importing the CSV file into a new, empty table to see if that resolves the issue.

Finally, if you are still having trouble, you may want to consider reaching out to the psycopg2 community or PostgreSQL support for further assistance.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message you are seeing suggests that the PostgreSQL database is having trouble finding the "Sequence" column in your CSV file. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a mismatch between the column name in the CSV file and the column name in the database schema, or a problem with the data in the column itself.

One thing you could try is to check that the column name in the CSV file is exactly the same as the column name in the database schema. In your DDL, you have enclosed the column name in double quotes, which means that the column name is case-sensitive. Make sure that the column name in the CSV file is also enclosed in double quotes and has the same capitalization.

Another thing to check is the data in the "Sequence" column. Make sure that all the values in the column are integers and that there are no missing or invalid values. You could also try renaming the column in the CSV file to something else (e.g. "ModuleSequence") and updating the DDL accordingly to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you could try importing the CSV file into a temporary table in the database and then copying the data over to the final table using a SQL query. This would give you more control over the import process and allow you to troubleshoot any issues that arise.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message you are seeing suggests that the PostgreSQL database is expecting an attribute called "Sequence" in the CSV file, but it cannot find it. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a typo in the column name, or a formatting issue in the CSV file.

One thing you could try is to check the formatting of the CSV file to make sure that the column names are exactly the same as what is expected by the database. For example, make sure that there are no extra spaces or special characters in the column name.

Another thing to check is the data type of the "Sequence" column in the CSV file. Make sure that it matches the data type of the corresponding column in the database table.

If you are still having trouble, you could try importing the CSV file into a temporary table in the database first, and then copying the data over to the final table. This can help to ensure that the data is formatted correctly and that the column names match up.

Alternatively, you could try using a different tool to import the CSV file into the database, such as the COPY command in PostgreSQL or a third-party tool like pgloader.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
