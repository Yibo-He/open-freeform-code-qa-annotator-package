I am trying to process images and I would like to brighten the dark areas of my image. I tried Histogram Equalization, however as there are also some bright areas in the image, the result is not satisfying. This is why I am looking for a way to brighten  of the image.
As an example, Input image is on the left and the expected result is on the right, the hair and face of the girl are brightened

ImageMagick seems to offer some possibilities to achieve this, however, I would like to do it using python

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

One way to brighten the dark areas of an image in Python is to use the OpenCV library. Here is an example code snippet that you can use:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply adaptive thresholding to brighten the dark areas
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY, 11, 2)

# Merge the thresholded image with the original image
result = cv2.merge((cv2.bitwise_and(img[:,:,0], thresh), cv2.bitwise_and(img[:,:,1], thresh), cv2.bitwise_and(img[:,:,2], thresh)))

# Save the result
cv2.imwrite('output_image.jpg', result)
```

In this code, we first load the input image using the `cv2.imread` function. Then, we convert the image to grayscale using the `cv2.cvtColor` function. Next, we apply adaptive thresholding to the grayscale image using the `cv2.adaptiveThreshold` function. This function calculates a threshold value for each pixel based on the mean of the surrounding pixels, and then applies a binary threshold to the pixel based on this value. This has the effect of brightening the dark areas of the image.

Finally, we merge the thresholded image with the original image using the `cv2.merge` function, and save the result using the `cv2.imwrite` function.

You can adjust the parameters of the `cv2.adaptiveThreshold` function to achieve the desired level of brightness in the dark areas of your image.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

One way to brighten the dark areas of an image in Python is to use the OpenCV library. Here is an example code that you can use:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply adaptive thresholding to the grayscale image
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2)

# Apply a bilateral filter to smooth the image
smooth = cv2.bilateralFilter(img, 9, 75, 75)

# Combine the thresholded image and the smoothed image
result = cv2.bitwise_and(smooth, smooth, mask=thresh)

# Save the result
cv2.imwrite('output_image.jpg', result)
```

In this code, we first load the input image and convert it to grayscale. We then apply adaptive thresholding to the grayscale image to separate the dark and bright areas. Next, we apply a bilateral filter to smooth the image while preserving the edges. Finally, we combine the thresholded image and the smoothed image using a bitwise AND operation to obtain the final result. The output image will have the dark areas brightened while preserving the bright areas.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

One way to brighten the dark areas of an image in Python is to use the OpenCV library. Here is an example code that you can use:

```python
import cv2

# Load the image
img = cv2.imread('input_image.jpg')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)

# Apply adaptive thresholding to enhance the dark areas
thresh = cv2.adaptiveThreshold(gray, 255, cv2.ADAPTIVE_THRESH_MEAN_C, cv2.THRESH_BINARY_INV, 11, 2)

# Apply a Gaussian blur to smooth the edges
blur = cv2.GaussianBlur(thresh, (0, 0), 3)

# Blend the original image with the brightened image
result = cv2.addWeighted(img, 1.5, cv2.cvtColor(blur, cv2.COLOR_GRAY2BGR), -0.5, 0)

# Save the result
cv2.imwrite('output_image.jpg', result)
```

In this code, we first load the input image and convert it to grayscale. Then, we apply adaptive thresholding to enhance the dark areas of the image. We also apply a Gaussian blur to smooth the edges of the brightened areas. Finally, we blend the original image with the brightened image using the `addWeighted` function, and save the result to a file.

You can adjust the parameters of the adaptive thresholding and Gaussian blur functions to achieve the desired level of brightness and smoothness.
