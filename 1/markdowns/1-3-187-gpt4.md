Community of stackoverflow:
I have a list "rest" which is the following:
```
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
```

I have another list which is b:
```
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

And I have a "last" list:
```
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

I have to replace the first 4 elements in b with the elements in rest. How can I replace the elements in last according to the matches with b to get the rest elements?
for example:
```
5   7   11   4   #elements from rest
b= [21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
```

to get last list as the following:
```
last=[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]  #elements that matched with b were replaced by rest
```

How can I do this?

You can create a dictionary that maps the elements in `b` to the elements in `rest` for the first 4 elements. Then, you can use a list comprehension to create a new list that replaces the elements in `last` according to this dictionary. Here is how you can do it:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Create a dictionary that maps the first 4 elements in b to rest
replace_dict = {b[i]: rest[i] for i in range(4)}

# Create a new list that replaces the elements in last according to replace_dict
new_last = [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]

print(new_last)
```

This will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This works by using the `get` method of the dictionary, which returns the value for a key if it exists in the dictionary, and a default value if it does not. In this case, the default value is the element itself, so elements in `last` that do not need to be replaced are left as they are.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can achieve this by creating a dictionary that maps the elements in `b` to the elements in `rest`, and then use a list comprehension to replace the elements in `last`.

Here is the Python code:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Create a dictionary that maps b to rest
b_to_rest = dict(zip(b[:len(rest)], rest))

# Replace elements in last using the dictionary
last = [b_to_rest.get(i, i) for i in last]

print(last)
```

This code will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

This works by using the `get` method of the dictionary, which returns the value for a key if it exists in the dictionary, and a default value if it does not. In this case, the default value is the element itself, so elements in `last` that do not exist in `b` are not replaced.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can create a dictionary from the first four elements of `b` and `rest`, then use a list comprehension to replace the elements in `last`:

```python
rest=[5, 7, 11, 4]
b=[21, 22, 33, 31, 23, 15, 19, 13, 6]
last=[33, 19, 40, 21, 31, 22, 6, 15, 13, 23]

# Create a dictionary where the keys are the first four elements of b and the values are rest
replace_dict = dict(zip(b[:4], rest))

# Replace elements in last using the dictionary
last = [replace_dict.get(i, i) for i in last]

print(last)
```

This will output:

```
[11, 19, 40, 5, 4, 7, 6, 15, 13, 23]
```

In the list comprehension, `replace_dict.get(i, i)` will return the value from the dictionary if `i` is a key in the dictionary, otherwise it will return `i`. This means that only the elements in `last` that are in the dictionary will be replaced, the rest will stay the same.
