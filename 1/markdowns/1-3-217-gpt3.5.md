I have a tensor `inps`, which has a size of `[64, 161, 1]` and I have some new data `d` which has a size of `[64, 161]`. How can I add `d` to `inps` such that the new size is `[64, 161, 2]`?

You can use the PyTorch `unsqueeze` function to add a new dimension to the `d` tensor and then concatenate it with the `inps` tensor along the last dimension using the `cat` function. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import torch

# create the tensors
inps = torch.randn(64, 161, 1)
d = torch.randn(64, 161)

# add a new dimension to d
d = d.unsqueeze(-1)

# concatenate the tensors along the last dimension
out = torch.cat([inps, d], dim=-1)

# check the size of the output tensor
print(out.size())  # should be [64, 161, 2]
```

In this example, we first create the `inps` and `d` tensors using the `torch.randn` function. Then, we add a new dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze` function with an argument of `-1`, which adds a new dimension at the end of the tensor. Finally, we concatenate the `inps` and `d` tensors along the last dimension using the `cat` function with an argument of `-1`, which concatenates the tensors along the last dimension. The resulting tensor `out` has a size of `[64, 161, 2]`.

You can use the PyTorch `unsqueeze` function to add a new dimension to the `d` tensor and then concatenate it with the `inps` tensor along the last dimension using the `cat` function. Here's an example code snippet:

```python
import torch

inps = torch.randn(64, 161, 1)
d = torch.randn(64, 161)

# Add a new dimension to d
d = d.unsqueeze(-1)

# Concatenate inps and d along the last dimension
out = torch.cat([inps, d], dim=-1)

print(out.size())  # Output: torch.Size([64, 161, 2])
```

In this example, we first create a random tensor `inps` of size `[64, 161, 1]` and a random tensor `d` of size `[64, 161]`. We then add a new dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze` function, resulting in a tensor of size `[64, 161, 1]`. Finally, we concatenate `inps` and `d` along the last dimension using the `cat` function, resulting in a tensor of size `[64, 161, 2]`.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the PyTorch `torch.cat()` function to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension. Here's an example code snippet:

```
import torch

# create the tensors
inps = torch.randn(64, 161, 1)
d = torch.randn(64, 161)

# add a new dimension to d
d = d.unsqueeze(-1)

# concatenate the tensors along the last dimension
out = torch.cat([inps, d], dim=-1)

# print the output size
print(out.size())  # should be [64, 161, 2]
```

In this code, we first add a new dimension to `d` using the `unsqueeze()` function so that it has the same number of dimensions as `inps`. Then, we use `torch.cat()` to concatenate the two tensors along the last dimension (`dim=-1`). The resulting tensor `out` has a size of `[64, 161, 2]`.
