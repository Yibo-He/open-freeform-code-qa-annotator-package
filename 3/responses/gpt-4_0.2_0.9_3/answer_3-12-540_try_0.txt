Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components. This can be achieved using various widgets, but the most common one is the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here's a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your first component goes here
      ),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your second component goes here
      ),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your third component goes here
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three components. You can adjust the color and thickness of the lines as per your requirements. 

Remember to import the material.dart package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Also, note that `VerticalDivider` is not visible if the parent widget does not specify the height, and it does not occupy any space if used in a row without an `Expanded` or `Flexible` widget.
