The error message you're seeing is indicating that the Android Manifest file is not correctly configured. 

Here are some steps to fix the issues:

1. Make sure you have added the correct permissions in the AndroidManifest.xml file. For geolocation, you should have both `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION` and `ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` permissions. 

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
```

2. The error "Attribute android:icon is not allowed here" suggests that the `android:icon` attribute is not in the correct place. It should be inside the `<application>` tag, not the `<activity>` tag. 

3. The error "Unresolved class 'MainActivity'" suggests that the MainActivity class is not found. Make sure that the MainActivity.java file is in the correct location (usually in the `src/main/java/com/example/your_project_name/` directory) and that the package name in the MainActivity.java file matches the package name in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

4. Make sure you have the correct package name in the `package` attribute of the `<manifest>` tag and in the `android:name` attribute of the `<activity>` tag. The package name should match the package structure of your project.

5. If you have recently changed the package name of your project, make sure to update the package name in all places in your project where it is referenced, including the AndroidManifest.xml file and any Java or Kotlin files.

6. Try to clean and rebuild your project. Sometimes, the build system can get into a bad state, and cleaning and rebuilding the project can fix issues. You can do this in Android Studio by clicking on `Build -> Clean Project` and then `Build -> Rebuild Project`.

7. If none of the above steps work, try invalidating the caches and restarting Android Studio. You can do this by clicking on `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart`. This will clear the caches and restart Android Studio, which can sometimes fix issues.
