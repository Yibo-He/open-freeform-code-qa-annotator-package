The error is because the `operator==` in your `SeviceClient` class is not matching the signature of the `operator==` in your `IClient` class. 

In `IClient` class, you have declared `operator==` as:
```cpp
virtual bool operator==(const IClient& anotherClient) = 0;
```
So, it expects a reference to an `IClient` object.

But in `SeviceClient` class, you have declared `operator==` as:
```cpp
bool operator==(const SeviceClient& anotherClient) override;
```
Here, it expects a reference to a `SeviceClient` object.

That's why the compiler is complaining that `SeviceClient::operator==` does not override any base class method, because it can't find a method with the same signature in the base class.

To fix this, you should change `operator==` in `SeviceClient` to match the signature in `IClient`, like you did:
```cpp
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override;
```
This is the correct solution. However, you will need to use dynamic_cast or static_cast to convert `anotherClient` to `SeviceClient` inside the method body if you need to access `SeviceClient` specific methods or members. Be careful with this, as it can lead to runtime errors if `anotherClient` is not actually a `SeviceClient`.
