In Dart, when you assign a list to another list, it doesn't create a new list. Instead, it creates a new reference to the existing list. So, when you clear `mylist`, it also clears `mynewlist` because they both refer to the same list.

To create a new list with the same elements, you should use the `List.from` constructor. This will create a new list that is a copy of the original list.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
onPressed: () {
  setState(() {
    print('clicked 3rd');
    print(mylist.length);
    print(mynewlist.length);
    mylist = List.from(mynewlist);
  });
},
```

Now, when you clear `mylist`, it won't affect `mynewlist` because they are separate lists.
