The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the `Row` widget tries to place all its children in a single line. When the text is too long to fit, it wraps to the next line but it's still considered as a single widget in the row, so it starts where the `Icon` widget ends.

To achieve the desired effect, you can wrap your `Text` and `Icon` widgets in a `Wrap` widget instead of a `Row`. The `Wrap` widget automatically arranges its children and moves them to the next line when there's not enough space.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Text(
      'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this code, the `Wrap` widget places the `Text` and `Icon` widgets in a line, and if there's not enough space for the second `Text` widget, it moves it to the next line. The `crossAxisAlignment` property is set to `WrapCrossAlignment.center` to align the widgets in the center vertically.
