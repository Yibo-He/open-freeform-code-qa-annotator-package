The error message indicates that the build is failing due to an issue with the `node-sass` package. This package has been deprecated in favor of `sass`. 

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Replace `node-sass` with `sass` in your `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "sass": "^1.43.4",
  ...
}
```

2. Remove the `node_modules` directory and `yarn.lock` file:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules
rm yarn.lock
```

3. Install the dependencies again:

```bash
yarn install
```

4. Commit the changes and push to Heroku again.

If the issue persists, it might be due to the Node.js version specified in the `engines` field of your `package.json` file. The error message indicates that the Node.js version being used is `v16.13.1`, but your local Node.js version is `v12.22.7`. 

You can try changing the Node.js version in the `engines` field to match your local version:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "12.x"
}
```

Then commit the changes and push to Heroku again.
