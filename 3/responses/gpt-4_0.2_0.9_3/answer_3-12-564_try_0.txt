The error message is quite clear: "Make sure you are not using the same ad object in more than one AdWidget". This means that you are trying to use the same `BannerAd` object in multiple `AdWidget`s, which is not allowed.

In your case, you are using `posts[index] as BannerAd` as your ad object. If the same `BannerAd` object is used in multiple `AdWidget`s, it will cause this error.

To solve this issue, you need to ensure that each `AdWidget` has its own unique `BannerAd` object. You can do this by creating a new `BannerAd` object for each `AdWidget`.

Here is an example of how you can modify your code:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post) {
      return posts[index];
    } else {
      // Create a new BannerAd object for each AdWidget
      final bannerAd = BannerAd(
        adUnitId: '<your-ad-unit-id>',
        size: AdSize.banner,
        request: AdRequest(),
        listener: BannerAdListener(),
      )..load();

      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: bannerAd),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics()),
);
```

Please replace `<your-ad-unit-id>` with your actual AdMob ad unit ID. Also, you may need to customize the `BannerAdListener` according to your needs.
