The error message suggests that the Flutter framework is receiving a stack trace from the `stack_trace` package, where it was expecting a stack trace from the Dart VM or the web. This can happen if `FlutterError.demangleStackTrace` was not set in an environment that propagates non-standard stack traces to the framework, such as during tests.

However, the error message also suggests that the error-causing widget was `MaterialApp`. This might be because you are wrapping `MaterialApp` inside another `MaterialApp` in your `HelloWorld` widget.

Here is the problematic code:

```dart
class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
  const HelloWorld({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => MaterialApp(
        theme: â€¦,
        home: const App(),
      );
}
```

And in your `main.dart`:

```dart
runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MaterialApp(home: HelloWorld())));
```

You are essentially nesting two `MaterialApp` widgets, which is not recommended. The `MaterialApp` should be at the root of your widget tree and there should only be one.

To fix this, you should remove the `MaterialApp` from your `HelloWorld` widget:

```dart
class HelloWorld extends StatelessWidget {
  const HelloWorld({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => const App();
}
```

And then in your `main.dart`, you can wrap `HelloWorld` with `MaterialApp`:

```dart
runApp(const ProviderScope(child: HelloWorld()));
```

This way, `MaterialApp` is only used once and at the root of your widget tree.
