This issue could be due to a variety of reasons. Here are a few things you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check your USB connection:** Make sure your device is properly connected to your computer. Try using a different USB port or cable if necessary.

2. **Enable USB Debugging:** Ensure that USB debugging is enabled on your device. You can do this by going to the Developer Options in your device settings. If you can't see Developer Options, go to About Phone and tap on the Build Number 7 times to enable it.

3. **Check Flutter Doctor:** Run the `flutter doctor` command in your terminal. This will check your environment and display a report of the status of your Flutter installation. The output should tell you if there are any issues with your setup.

4. **Try a different device or emulator:** If possible, try running your app on a different device or an emulator to see if the problem is specific to your device.

5. **Clean and Rebuild the Project:** Sometimes, cleaning the project and rebuilding it can solve the issue. You can do this by running the following commands:
    ```
    flutter clean
    flutter run
    ```

6. **Update Flutter and Dart:** Make sure you are using the latest versions of Flutter and Dart. You can update Flutter by running `flutter upgrade` and Dart by running `pub global activate dart`.

If none of these solutions work, it might be helpful to look at the logs for more detailed information about what's going wrong. You can view the logs by running `flutter run -v`.
