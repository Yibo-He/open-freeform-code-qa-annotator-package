The error message is indicating that the `AppBarDesign` class can't be assigned to the `appBar` parameter of the `Scaffold` widget because `AppBarDesign` is not a subtype of `PreferredSizeWidget`. 

In Flutter, the `appBar` parameter of the `Scaffold` widget expects a widget that implements `PreferredSizeWidget`. The `AppBar` widget is one such widget, which is why it's commonly used as the `appBar` parameter.

In your code, you're trying to use `AppBarDesign` as the `appBar`, but `AppBarDesign` is a `StatelessWidget`, not a `PreferredSizeWidget`. 

To fix this issue, you can make `AppBarDesign` return an `AppBar` directly, like this:

```dart
class AppBarDesign extends StatelessWidget {
  AppBarDesign(Key key, this.title) : super(key: key);

  final title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return AppBar(
      title: Text(title),
    );
  }
}
```

Then, in `MyHomePage`, you can use `AppBarDesign` like this:

```dart
class MyHomePage extends StatelessWidget {
  MyHomePage(Key key, this.title) : super(key: key);

  final title;

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
      appBar: AppBarDesign(key, title),
    );
  }
}
```

This way, `AppBarDesign` is still a `StatelessWidget`, but it returns an `AppBar`, which is a `PreferredSizeWidget`, so it can be used as the `appBar` parameter of the `Scaffold` widget.
