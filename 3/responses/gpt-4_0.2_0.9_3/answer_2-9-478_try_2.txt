The error you're seeing is due to an incompatibility between Devise and the version of Rails you're using. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Rails 7.0.0 or Ruby 3.0.0.

To fix this issue, you can use the latest version of Devise that is compatible with Rails 7.0.0 and Ruby 3.0.0. At the time of writing, the compatible version of Devise is 4.8.1.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Open your Gemfile and update the devise gem to the latest version:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.1'
```

2. Run the bundle update command to update the gem:

```bash
bundle update devise
```

3. Restart your Rails server.
