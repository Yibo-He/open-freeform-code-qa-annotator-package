This error is because Sprockets 4 requires you to have a manifest file. The manifest file is used to list the files and assets that you want to precompile in production.

You can fix this issue by creating a new file `app/assets/config/manifest.js` and adding the following lines:

```javascript
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
```

This will include all your images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files in the asset pipeline.

Remember to restart your server after making these changes.
