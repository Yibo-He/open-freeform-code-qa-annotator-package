You can use the `sort_by` function to sort by multiple keys. This function allows you to provide a comparator function that can compare two elements of the vector. In your case, you can compare first by `row` and then by `column`. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| {
    let row_cmp = a.row.cmp(&b.row);
    if row_cmp == std::cmp::Ordering::Equal {
        a.column.cmp(&b.column)
    } else {
        row_cmp
    }
});
```

In this code, we first compare the `row` of `a` and `b`. If they are equal, we then compare the `column`. This way, the vector is first sorted by `row` and then by `column` within each group of equal `row`.
