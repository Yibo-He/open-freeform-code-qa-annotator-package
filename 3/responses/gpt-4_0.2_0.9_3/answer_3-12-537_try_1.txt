The error message is indicating that it can't find the Android Gradle plugin version 5.6.2. However, there's no such version of the Android Gradle plugin. The version of the Android Gradle plugin is not the same as the version of Gradle.

Here's what you should do:

1. Change the version of the Android Gradle plugin in your project-level build.gradle file to a valid version. As of now, the latest stable version is 4.1.0. So, change this line:

```groovy
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

to this:

```groovy
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

2. The version of Gradle that you're using (5.6.2 according to your gradle-wrapper.properties file) is compatible with the Android Gradle plugin version 4.1.0, so you don't need to change it. But if you want to use the latest version of Gradle (6.7.1 as of now), you can change this line in your gradle-wrapper.properties file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-5.6.2-all.zip
```

to this:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.7.1-all.zip
```

3. After making these changes, try to build your project again. If you're still facing issues, try to invalidate caches and restart from the File menu in Android Studio.
