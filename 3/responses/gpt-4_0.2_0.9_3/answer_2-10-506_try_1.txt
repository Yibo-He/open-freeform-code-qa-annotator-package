You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];

if let Some(min) = v.iter().min() {
    println!("The minimum value is {}", min);
} else {
    println!("The vector is empty");
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option` that contains the minimum value if the vector is not empty, or `None` if the vector is empty. The `if let` syntax is used to handle this `Option`.

Please note that `min()` method returns a reference to the minimum value, not the value itself. If you need the value, you can dereference it using `*`.
