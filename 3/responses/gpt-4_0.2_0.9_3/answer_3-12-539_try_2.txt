The error message indicates that the Flutter engine is unable to find an implementation for the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` method on the `path_provider` plugin. This usually happens when the plugin is not properly registered with the Flutter engine.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Ensure you have the latest version of the plugin:** Check your `pubspec.yaml` file and make sure you have the latest version of the `path_provider` plugin. You can check the latest version on the [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider) website.

2. **Stop the app and run it again:** Sometimes, hot reload or hot restart may not work properly with plugins. Try stopping the app and running it again using `flutter run`.

3. **Check your project's AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist files:** Make sure that the `path_provider` plugin is properly registered in your AndroidManifest.xml (for Android) and Info.plist (for iOS) files.

4. **Try running flutter doctor:** Run `flutter doctor` to check if there are any issues with your Flutter installation.

5. **Try creating a new Flutter project and adding the plugin:** If none of the above steps work, try creating a new Flutter project and adding the `path_provider` plugin to see if it works in a new project. If it works in the new project, there might be something wrong with your existing project configuration.

If none of these steps work, it might be a bug with the `path_provider` plugin itself. In this case, you can open an issue on the plugin's GitHub repository.
