The error message suggests that the `ruby/config.h` file is not found. This is likely because the Ruby development headers are not installed or not found in your system.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Reinstall Ruby using Homebrew**: Homebrew is a package manager for macOS that can help manage software installations. It's possible that the Ruby version you're using is not compatible with the gem you're trying to install. You can install a new version of Ruby using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install ruby
   ```

   After installing Ruby, you may need to update your `PATH` to use the Homebrew version of Ruby instead of the system version. You can do this by adding the following line to your shell profile file (like `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc`):

   ```bash
   export PATH="/usr/local/opt/ruby/bin:$PATH"
   ```

   Then, reload your shell profile:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   # or
   source ~/.zshrc
   ```

   Verify that you're using the new version of Ruby:

   ```bash
   ruby -v
   ```

   Then, try installing the gem again:

   ```bash
   gem install travis
   ```

2. **Install Ruby development headers**: If you're using a system package manager like `apt` or `yum`, you can install the Ruby development headers using the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install ruby-dev
   # or
   sudo yum install ruby-devel
   ```

   Then, try installing the gem again.

3. **Check your compiler**: The error message also suggests that there might be an issue with your compiler. Make sure you have the necessary build tools installed. On macOS, you can do this by installing Xcode Command Line Tools:

   ```bash
   xcode-select --install
   ```

   Then, try installing the gem again.

Remember to replace the commands with the appropriate ones for your shell and package manager. If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about your environment (like your operating system, Ruby version, etc.) so I can give a more specific solution.
