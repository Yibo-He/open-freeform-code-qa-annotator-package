You can use the `?` operator to simplify this code. The `?` operator is used after an expression that returns `Result` or `Option`, and will return early if the `Result` is `Err` or the `Option` is `None`. 

However, the `?` operator can only be used in functions that return `Result` or `Option`. So, you would need to change your function to return `Option<()>` or `Result<(), &'static str>`. 

Here's how you could refactor your code using `?` and `Result`:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    let i = func1().ok_or("func 1 returned None")?;
    let j = func2(i).ok_or("func 2 returned None")?;
    let k = func3(j).ok_or("func 3 returned None")?;
    let result = func4(k).ok_or("func 4 returned None")?;

    // Do something with result

    Ok(())
}
```

In this code, `ok_or` is used to convert `Option` to `Result`. If the `Option` is `None`, it will become `Err` with the provided error message. If the `Option` is `Some`, it will become `Ok` with the contained value.

Then, the `?` operator is used to either get the value from `Ok`, or return early with `Err`. This way, the code is much flatter and easier to read.

If you want to stick with `Option` and just print the error messages, you can do something similar with a custom function:

```rust
fn print_and_return_none(error: &'static str) -> Option<()> {
    println!("{}", error);
    None
}

fn main() {
    let i = func1().or_else(|| print_and_return_none("func 1 returned None"))?;
    let j = func2(i).or_else(|| print_and_return_none("func 2 returned None"))?;
    let k = func3(j).or_else(|| print_and_return_none("func 3 returned None"))?;
    let result = func4(k).or_else(|| print_and_return_none("func 4 returned None"))?;

    // Do something with result
}
```

In this code, `or_else` is used to either get the value from `Some`, or call the provided function if the `Option` is `None`. The provided function will print the error message and return `None`, causing the `?` operator to return early.
