This error is due to Sprockets 4 requiring a manifest file. Sprockets is a Ruby library for compiling and serving web assets. It features declarative dependency management for JavaScript and CSS assets, as well as a powerful preprocessor pipeline that allows you to write assets in languages like CoffeeScript, Sass and SCSS.

To fix this issue, you need to create a new file `app/assets/config/manifest.js` and add the following lines:

```javascript
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
```

This file is used by Sprockets to understand what files need to be compiled and served. The `link_tree` directive includes all files in the specified directory and its subdirectories, while `link_directory` includes all files in the specified directory.

After creating this file, try to boot your Rails app again. It should work fine now.
