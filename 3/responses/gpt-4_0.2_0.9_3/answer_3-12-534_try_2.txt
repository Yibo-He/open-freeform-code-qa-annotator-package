Yes, it is possible to use multiple providers for a single widget. However, it's important to understand that the Provider pattern is used to manage state and pass data down the widget tree. It's not necessarily tied to the number of widgets you have.

If you have 4 different classes that extend `ChangeNotifier`, it means you have 4 different types of data that you want to manage and pass around. You can provide these at the top of your widget tree and then use `Consumer` widgets or `context.read`, `context.watch`, and `context.select` to listen to changes in these data wherever you need.

Here's an example of how you can provide multiple `ChangeNotifier`:

```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class1()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class2()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class3()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class4()),
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: HomeScreen(),
  ),
);
```

In your `CurvedNavigationBar`, you can use `Consumer` to rebuild the navigation bar whenever there's a change in the data:

```dart
Consumer<Class1>(
  builder: (context, class1, child) {
    return CurvedNavigationBar(
      // use class1 data
    );
  },
);
```

You can do the same for `Class2`, `Class3`, and `Class4`.

However, if the 4 classes are related and are always used together, it might be better to combine them into a single class that extends `ChangeNotifier`. This way, you only need to provide and listen to one class. This can simplify your code and potentially improve performance.

Remember, the goal of using `Provider` is to manage state and make your code more maintainable. The best approach depends on the specific needs of your app.
