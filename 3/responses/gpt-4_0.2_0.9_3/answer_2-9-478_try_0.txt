The error you're encountering is related to the compatibility of Devise with Ruby 3.0.0. The Devise version you're using (4.8.0) is not fully compatible with Ruby 3.0.0.

The issue is that Ruby 3.0.0 removed the `Module#ref` method which is used in Devise 4.8.0. This is why you're seeing the `undefined method 'reference' for ActiveSupport::Dependencies:Module (NoMethodError)` error.

To fix this issue, you have two options:

1. Downgrade your Ruby version to 2.7.x or lower. This can be done by modifying your `.ruby-version` file or through your version manager (like RVM or rbenv).

2. Upgrade your Devise gem to a version that supports Ruby 3.0.0. At the time of writing, Devise has not released a version that supports Ruby 3.0.0, but you can use the master branch from the GitHub repository which has the necessary fixes. You can do this by changing your Gemfile to:

```ruby
gem 'devise', github: 'heartcombo/devise'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the gem from the GitHub repository.

Remember to always check the compatibility of your gems with your Ruby version to avoid these kinds of issues.
