The error message you're seeing is due to a change in macOS 11 Big Sur. The system no longer includes certain header files that Ruby versions prior to 2.7.2 require to build.

You have two options to resolve this issue:

1. Upgrade to a newer version of Ruby that supports macOS Big Sur. Ruby 2.7.2 and later versions have been patched to build on macOS Big Sur. You can install it with `rbenv install 2.7.2`.

2. If you need to use an older version of Ruby, you can patch the Ruby source code to work with macOS Big Sur. Here's how you can do it:

- First, download the Ruby source code for the version you want to install. For example, for Ruby 2.5.3, you can download it from https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.5/ruby-2.5.3.tar.bz2.
- Extract the tarball and open the file `ruby-2.5.3/thread_pthread.c` in a text editor.
- Find the line `#  include "/usr/include/pthread/pthread.h"` and comment it out by adding a `//` at the beginning of the line.
- Save the file and compress the Ruby source code back into a tarball.
- Move the tarball to the directory `~/.rbenv/cache/`.
- Now you can install Ruby with `rbenv install 2.5.3`.

Please note that the second option is a workaround and may not work for all older versions of Ruby. It's generally recommended to use a version of Ruby that officially supports your operating system.
