In Rust, you can use the `chunks` method to split your vector into chunks of 2 elements and then use `map` and `collect` to create your `HashMap`. Here is a one-liner:

```rust
let map: HashMap<_, _> = vec.chunks(2).map(|chunk| (chunk[0].to_string(), chunk[1].to_string())).collect();
```

This will create a `HashMap` where the keys and values are the 0th and 1st elements of each chunk, respectively. 

Please note that this will panic if your vector doesn't have an even number of elements. You might want to add a check for that before running this code.

Also, this assumes that your vector contains strings. If it contains something else, you might need to adjust the `to_string` calls.
