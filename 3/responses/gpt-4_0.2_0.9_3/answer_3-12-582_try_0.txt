Yes, they are essentially the same, but they are used in different scenarios.

1. `Provider.of<Model>(context, listen: false)` and `context.read<Model>()` are the same. They are used when you want to access the data but don't need the widget to rebuild when the data changes.

2. `Provider.of<Model>(context)` and `context.watch<Model>()` are the same. They are used when you want the widget to rebuild whenever the data changes.

The error you're seeing is because `context.read<Model>()` should not be used inside the `build()` method. The `build()` method could potentially be called every frame, and `context.read()` is not meant to be used in this way. It's designed to be used for one-time reads of the data, not for continuous listening.

On the other hand, `Provider.of<Model>(context)` is designed to be used in the `build()` method because it sets up a listener that rebuilds the widget whenever the data changes.

In short, use `context.watch<Model>()` or `Provider.of<Model>(context)` inside your `build()` method if you want your widget to rebuild when the data changes. Use `context.read<Model>()` or `Provider.of<Model>(context, listen: false)` when you want to read the data once and don't need the widget to rebuild when the data changes.
