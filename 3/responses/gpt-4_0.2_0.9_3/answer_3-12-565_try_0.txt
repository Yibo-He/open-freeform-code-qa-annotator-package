To open WhatsApp from your Flutter app, you can use the `url_launcher` package. This package allows you to open URLs in the mobile platform. It supports both Android and iOS.

First, you need to add `url_launcher` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  url_launcher: ^6.0.16
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

Now, you can use the `launch` method from `url_launcher` to open WhatsApp. Here's a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch WhatsApp'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _launchWhatsApp,
            child: Text('Open WhatsApp'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  _launchWhatsApp() async {
    const url = 'https://wa.me/<number>?text=Hello'; // replace <number> with the receiver's phone number
    if (await canLaunch(url)) {
      await launch(url);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $url';
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, when the button is pressed, it will attempt to open WhatsApp with a pre-filled message of "Hello" to the number specified in the URL.

Please replace `<number>` with the receiver's phone number in international format (i.e., without '+' and with country code). For example, for a US number (123) 456-7890, use 11234567890.

Please note that the user must have WhatsApp installed on their device for this to work. If WhatsApp is not installed, an error will be thrown.

Also, note that this will not work in a webview, as webviews do not have access to the device's installed apps. This will only work in a full Flutter app.
