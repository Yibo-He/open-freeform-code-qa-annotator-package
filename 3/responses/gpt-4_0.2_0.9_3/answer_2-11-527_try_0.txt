1. The reason there is no deadlock among those threads is because of the way the `std::unique_lock` is being used. When a thread calls `lk.unlock()`, it releases the mutex, allowing other threads to acquire it. Then, the thread sleeps for a short period of time before trying to reacquire the mutex with `lk.lock()`. If another thread has acquired the mutex in the meantime, the calling thread will block until the mutex is available again. This is a form of busy waiting, where the thread repeatedly releases and reacquires the mutex until the condition it's waiting for (`flag`) becomes true. It's important to note that this isn't the most efficient way to wait for a condition, and in a real-world scenario you'd likely use a condition variable instead.

2. `std::unique_lock` is a class template that provides a RAII-style mechanism for owning a mutex for the duration of a scoped block. When a `std::unique_lock` object is created, it attempts to take ownership of the mutex it's given. When control leaves the scope in which the `std::unique_lock` object was created, the `std::unique_lock` is destructed and the mutex is released. In this code, a new `std::unique_lock` is created in each thread and associated with the same mutex (`m`). This means that each thread will try to acquire the mutex when it starts, and will release it when it finishes. This is a way of ensuring that the threads don't interfere with each other's work.
