The error message you're seeing is because the `<experimental/filesystem>` header has been deprecated in C++17 and replaced with `<filesystem>`. 

The `#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` should be placed before the `#include <experimental/filesystem>` line to silence the warning.

However, if you're using C++17 or later, you should switch to using `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <windows.h>

// Check if we're using C++17 or later
#if __cplusplus >= 201703L
    #include <filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::filesystem;
#else
    #define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING
    #include <experimental/filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
#endif

using namespace std;
```

This code will use `<filesystem>` if you're using C++17 or later, and `<experimental/filesystem>` otherwise. The `#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` line will silence the deprecation warning for `<experimental/filesystem>`.

If you're still seeing errors, it's possible that your compiler doesn't fully support C++17 yet. In that case, you might need to update your compiler, or switch to a different one that has full C++17 support.
