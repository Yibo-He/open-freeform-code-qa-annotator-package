In Flutter, if a string overflows, it will automatically wrap and create a new line if the parent widget allows it. In your case, you are using a `Text` widget inside a `Card` widget. The `Text` widget will try to expand as much as it can, but the `Card` widget is limiting it.

You can control the overflow behavior of the `Text` widget using the `overflow` property. If you want the text to wrap and create a new line, you can set `overflow` to `TextOverflow.visible`. However, this will not work if the parent widget does not allow the `Text` widget to expand.

Here is how you can modify your `Text` widget:

```dart
Container(
  child: Card(
    child: Text(
      "${text[1]}",
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 20.0,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.w300
      ),
      textAlign: TextAlign.right,
      overflow: TextOverflow.visible, // Add this line
    )
  ),
),
```

If this does not solve your problem, then the issue might be with the parent widget. You might need to wrap your `Card` widget with a `Flexible` or `Expanded` widget to allow it to expand.

If you want to manually insert a line break in a string, you can do so using the `\n` character. For example:

```dart
String myString = 'This is a very long string that I want to break into multiple lines.\nThis is the second line.';
```

This will create a new line at the specified position. However, this might not be the best solution if your text is dynamic and you don't know where to insert the line breaks.
