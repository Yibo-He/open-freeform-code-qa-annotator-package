The error message suggests that you are using the same `AdWidget` in more than one place in your widget tree. This is not allowed. Each `AdWidget` should have a unique `Ad` object.

The problem is that you are using the same `BannerAd` object for multiple `AdWidget`s. Each `AdWidget` should have its own `BannerAd` object.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Create a new `BannerAd` for each `AdWidget` you want to display. You can do this in your `ListView.builder` method.

2. Make sure that you dispose of the `BannerAd` when it's no longer needed. You can do this in the `dispose` method of your widget.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post){
      return posts[index];
    }
    else {
      final BannerAd myBanner = BannerAd(
        adUnitId: '<your-admob-unit-id>',
        size: AdSize.banner,
        request: AdRequest(),
        listener: AdListener(),
      )..load();

      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: myBanner),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics())
);
```

Remember to dispose of the `BannerAd` when it's no longer needed:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Dispose of the BannerAd object to free up resources.
  for (var post in posts) {
    if (post is BannerAd) {
      post.dispose();
    }
  }
  super.dispose();
}
```

This should solve your problem. Let me know if you have any other questions.
