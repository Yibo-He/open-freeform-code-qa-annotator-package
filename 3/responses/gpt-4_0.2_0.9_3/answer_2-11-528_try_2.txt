You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` or `_clang-format` file.

Here is an example of how to do it:

```yaml
---
Language:        Cpp
# Based on Google style
BasedOnStyle:  Google
SortIncludes:    false
...
```

This will prevent `clang-format` from sorting `#include` directives. 

The `SortIncludes` option is `true` by default in many styles, including the Google, LLVM, Chromium, Mozilla, and WebKit styles. If you're using one of these styles as a base, you'll need to explicitly set `SortIncludes: false` to disable include sorting.
