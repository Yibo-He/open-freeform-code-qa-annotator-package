In Rust, `Box<T>` is a type for heap allocation. A `Box` is a smart pointer to a heap allocated value of type `T`. When a box goes out of scope, its destructor is called, the inner object is destroyed, and the memory on the heap is deallocated.

`Option<T>` is a Rust standard library type for an optional value: every `Option<T>` is either `Some(T)` or `None`.

`Option<Box<T>>` means the value could be `Some(Box<T>)` or `None`. This is useful when you want to have a nullable `Box`. In other words, it might contain nothing (`None`), or it might contain something (`Some(Box<T>)`).

`Box<Option<T>>` means the value is a `Box` that might contain `None` or `Some(T)`. This is less common, because it means you always have a `Box`, but the `Box` might not contain a useful value.

In your case, you want to use `Option<Box<Node>>` for the `next` field in `Node` and `top` field in `Stack` because you want to allow the possibility of these fields being null. Here's how you can modify your code:

```rust
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Option<Box<Node>>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Option<Box<Node>>,
}
```

Now, you can check if `top` is a null pointer by using the `is_none()` method:

```rust
if stack.top.is_none() {
    // top is a null pointer
}
```

And you can check if `next` is a null pointer in a similar way:

```rust
if node.next.is_none() {
    // next is a null pointer
}
```

You can also use the `match` statement to handle `Option<Box<Node>>` values:

```rust
match stack.top {
    Some(node) => {
        // do something with node
    }
    None => {
        // top is a null pointer
    }
}
```
