In Rails 6, the default JavaScript compiler is webpacker. The `app/javascript/packs` directory is where webpacker looks for entry point files. These are the files webpacker compiles directly. 

Here is how you can add your custom JavaScript files:

1. Create a new directory `custom_js` under `app/javascript` (not under `app/javascript/packs`), and put your JavaScript files there.

2. Then, in your `app/javascript/packs/application.js` file, you can import your custom JavaScript files like this:

```javascript
import 'custom_js/my_file.js'
```

Replace `my_file.js` with the actual name of your JavaScript file. 

3. If you have multiple JavaScript files in the `custom_js` directory and you want to include all of them, you can create an `index.js` file in the `custom_js` directory that imports all the other JavaScript files:

```javascript
// app/javascript/custom_js/index.js
import './file1.js'
import './file2.js'
// ... import the rest of your files
```

Then, in your `application.js` file, you just need to import this `index.js` file:

```javascript
// app/javascript/packs/application.js
import 'custom_js'
```

4. Lastly, make sure that your `app/views/layouts/application.html.erb` (or the specific layout file you are using) has the following line in the head tag:

```erb
<%= javascript_pack_tag 'application', 'data-turbolinks-track': 'reload' %>
```

This line ensures that the compiled JavaScript is included in your HTML.

Remember, with webpacker, you don't use the `require` keyword to include JavaScript files, you use the `import` keyword.
