The code you provided for adding a new pair to the Map is correct. The error messages you're seeing might be related to other parts of your code. Here's how you can add a new pair to a Map in Dart:

```dart
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap["c"] = 3; // This will add a new pair with key "c" and value 3 to the map
```

Regarding the `Map.update` method, it is used to update the value for the provided key. If the key does not exist, you can provide an optional value to be inserted for the key. Here's an example:

```dart
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap.update("a", (existingValue) => existingValue + 1); // This will update the value of "a" to 2

// If the key does not exist, you can provide a second argument to the update method which will be used as the value for the key
someMap.update("c", (existingValue) => existingValue + 1, ifAbsent: () => 1); // This will add a new pair with key "c" and value 1 to the map
```

In the above example, the `update` method takes two arguments. The first one is a function that takes the existing value for the key and returns the new value. The second argument is a function that returns the value to be used if the key does not exist in the map. This second argument is optional.
