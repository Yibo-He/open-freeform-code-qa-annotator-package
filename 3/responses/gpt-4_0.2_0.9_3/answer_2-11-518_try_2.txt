You are correct in your understanding that smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined destructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, move constructors, and move assignment operators. Smart pointers are designed to manage resources, such as dynamically allocated memory, and automatically clean up when they are no longer needed. This can greatly simplify code and prevent common errors, such as memory leaks or double deletion.

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions:

1. **Performance considerations**: While smart pointers are very useful, they do have some overhead compared to raw pointers. In performance-critical code, it might be necessary to manage resources manually to get the best possible performance.

2. **Custom resource management**: Sometimes, you might need to manage resources in a way that is not supported by the standard smart pointers. For example, you might need to interface with a C library that requires resources to be allocated and deallocated in a specific way.

3. **Ownership semantics**: The standard smart pointers express specific ownership semantics. `std::unique_ptr` expresses exclusive ownership, while `std::shared_ptr` expresses shared ownership. If you need different ownership semantics, you might need to define your own resource management code.

4. **Legacy code**: If you are working with legacy code that does not use smart pointers, you might need to define these special member functions to ensure correct behavior.

5. **Non-memory resources**: Smart pointers are designed for memory management, but there are other resources that might need management as well, such as file handles, network sockets, database connections, etc. For these, you might need to define your own resource management code.

So while smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined special member functions, there are still cases where they might be necessary. It's also worth noting that even when using smart pointers, you might still want to define these functions to control copy/move behavior, or to do additional cleanup.
