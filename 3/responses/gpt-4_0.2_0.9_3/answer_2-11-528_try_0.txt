You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` configuration file. 

Here is an example of how to do it:

```
---
BasedOnStyle: LLVM
SortIncludes: false
...
```

This will prevent `clang-format` from sorting your `#include` directives. 

The `SortIncludes` option is `true` by default in many styles, including the LLVM, Google, Chromium, Mozilla, and WebKit styles. If you are using one of these styles as a base, you need to explicitly set `SortIncludes: false` to disable include sorting. 

Please note that this will apply to all files that are formatted using this `.clang-format` file. If you want to disable sorting only for specific files, you might need to use different `.clang-format` files for different parts of your project.
