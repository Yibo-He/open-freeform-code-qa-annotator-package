The error message you're seeing is due to a missing library in Ruby 3.0.0. The library `rexml` which is required by `kramdown` is not bundled by default in Ruby 3.0.0. 

To fix this issue, you need to add `rexml` and `webrick` to your Gemfile. `webrick` is also not bundled by default in Ruby 3.0.0 and it's required by Jekyll to serve your site locally.

Here is how you can modify your Gemfile:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem 'jekyll-scholar', group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", "~> 204", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem "tzinfo-data", platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]

# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.0" if Gem.win_platform?

# Add these lines
gem 'rexml', '~> 3.2', '>= 3.2.5'
gem 'webrick', '~> 1.7'
```

After modifying the Gemfile, run `bundle install` to install the new gems. Then, you should be able to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` without any issues.
