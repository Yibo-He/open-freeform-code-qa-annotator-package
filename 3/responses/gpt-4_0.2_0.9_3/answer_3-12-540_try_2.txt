Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget or the `Container` widget with a specified width and color to achieve this. Here's a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three components. You can customize the color and thickness of the line as per your requirements. 

If you want to use `Container` to draw the line, you can replace `VerticalDivider` with:

```dart
Container(
  height: double.infinity,
  width: 2,
  color: Colors.black,
)
```

This will also draw a vertical line. The height is set to `double.infinity` to make the line take up all available vertical space. The width is set to `2` to make the line 2 pixels wide. The color is set to `Colors.black` to make the line black.
