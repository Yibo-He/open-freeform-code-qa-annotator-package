The error message suggests that your app isn't using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library, which is no longer maintained. It provides the androidx.* package libraries, unbundled from the platform APIs. This means that it provides backward compatibility and updates more frequently than the Android platform.

Here are the steps to migrate your project to AndroidX:

1. Backup your project.
2. Open your project's `android/gradle.properties` file.
3. Add the following lines to the file:

```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

4. Save the file.
5. Open your project's `android/app/build.gradle` file.
6. Change the `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` to `28` or higher.
7. Save the file.
8. Run `flutter clean` in your terminal to clean your project.
9. Run your project again.

If you still encounter issues, you may need to manually migrate your dependencies to their AndroidX equivalents. You can refer to the official [AndroidX migration guide](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx/migrate) for more information.

If the problem persists, the issue might be with the Gradle version. You can try updating the Gradle version in `android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties` and `android/build.gradle` files.

In `gradle-wrapper.properties`, change the distributionUrl to the latest Gradle version:

```
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.7-all.zip
```

In `build.gradle`, change the Gradle classpath to the latest version:

```
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
}
```

Remember to run `flutter clean` after making these changes.
