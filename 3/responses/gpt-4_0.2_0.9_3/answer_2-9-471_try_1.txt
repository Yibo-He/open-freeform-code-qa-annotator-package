The issue you're facing is likely due to the way you're trying to import the image. When you're using Parcel, you can import an image directly as a string which will contain the final path to the image after being processed by Parcel.

Here's how you should import the image:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

In the above code, `img` is a string that contains the path to the image.

Also, make sure your `index.d.ts` file is in the correct location and is properly included in your `tsconfig.json`. The `index.d.ts` file should be in the root of your `src` directory, and your `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots" : ["./src/index.d.ts"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

In the above `tsconfig.json`, `"typeRoots" : ["./src/index.d.ts"]` is replaced with `"typeRoots" : ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/index.d.ts"]` to include the default TypeScript type definitions.

If you're still facing issues, try restarting your TypeScript server in VS Code. Sometimes, the server might not pick up changes to the `tsconfig.json` or `index.d.ts` files until it's restarted. You can do this by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), and running the "TypeScript: Restart TS server" command.
