You can use the `split()` method in Dart (the language used in Flutter) to split the string into a list of substrings based on the specific character. Then you can take the first element of the list which is the part of the string before the specific character. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
String str = 'one.two';
String result = str.split('.')[0];
print(result);  // prints: one
```

In this code, `split('.')` splits the string into a list of two strings: `['one', 'two']`. The `[0]` then selects the first element of this list. 

Please note that if the specific character does not exist in the string, the result will be the original string.
