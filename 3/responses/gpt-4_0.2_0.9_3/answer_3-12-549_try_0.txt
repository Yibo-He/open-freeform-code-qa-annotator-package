The problem you're facing is due to the fact that in Dart, when you assign a list to another list (like `mylist = mynewlist;`), you're not creating a new list with the same values, but you're actually making `mylist` point to the same object in memory as `mynewlist`. So, when you clear `mylist`, it also clears `mynewlist` because they are pointing to the same object.

To solve this problem, you should create a new list with the same values. You can do this by using the `List.from` constructor, which creates a new list from an existing one:

```dart
mylist = List.from(mynewlist);
```

This will create a new list with the same values as `mynewlist`, so when you clear `mylist`, `mynewlist` will not be affected. Here's how you can use it in your code:

```dart
FlatButton(
  onPressed: () {
    setState(() {
      print('clicked 3rd');
      print(mylist.length);
      print(mynewlist.length);
      mylist = List.from(mynewlist);
    });
  },
  child: Container(
    child: Column(
      children: <Widget>[
        Image.asset(
          'images/bulb.png',
          width: 100,
          height: 100,
        ),
        Text('bulb')
      ],
    ),
  ),
),
```
