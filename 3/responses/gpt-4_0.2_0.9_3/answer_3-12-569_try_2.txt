The `builder` parameter has been deprecated in favor of the `create` parameter. The `create` parameter is a function that creates a new instance of the provided class. Here is how you can update your code:

```dart
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()),
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This change was made to make the naming more consistent and intuitive. The `create` function is called when a new instance of the provided class is needed, which is exactly what it does.
