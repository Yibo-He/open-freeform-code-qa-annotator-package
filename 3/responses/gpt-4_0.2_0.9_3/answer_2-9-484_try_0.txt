You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the '|' character and then just select the first part. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_string = a.split('|')

# Get the first part
first_part = split_string[0]

print(first_part)
```

When you run this code, it will print:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The split is done at the specified separator. In this case, the separator is '|'. After the split, the first part of the string is the first item in the list, which is what you want.
