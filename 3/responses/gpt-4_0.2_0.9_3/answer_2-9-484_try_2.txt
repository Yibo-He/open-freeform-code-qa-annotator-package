You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the '|' character and then get the first element of the resulting list. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_string = a.split('|')

# Get the first element
first_element = split_string[0]

print(first_element)
```

This will output:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

This code works by splitting the string into a list of substrings each time it encounters the '|' character. The `split()` function returns a list of all the substrings. The first element of this list (index 0) is the substring before the first '|'.
