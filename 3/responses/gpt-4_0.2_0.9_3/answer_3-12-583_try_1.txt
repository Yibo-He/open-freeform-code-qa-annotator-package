The error message indicates that the AndroidManifest.xml file is not properly configured. Here are a few things you can check:

1. Make sure that the AndroidManifest.xml file you are editing is located in the correct directory. For a Flutter project, you should be editing the AndroidManifest.xml file located in the android/app/src/main/ directory.

2. The error "Attribute android:icon is not allowed here" suggests that there might be an issue with the icon attribute in your application tag. Make sure that the icon file exists in the specified location.

3. The error "Unresolved class 'MainActivity'" suggests that the MainActivity class cannot be found. Make sure that the MainActivity.java file exists in the correct location (usually in the android/app/src/main/java/com/example/your_project_name/ directory) and that the package name in the MainActivity.java file matches the package name in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

4. Make sure you have added the necessary permissions for location in your AndroidManifest.xml file. You should have both the ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION and ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION permissions:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION" />
```

5. After making these changes, try to clean and rebuild your project. You can do this by running flutter clean and then flutter run in your terminal.

If you are still facing issues, please provide more details about your project setup and the exact error messages you are seeing.
