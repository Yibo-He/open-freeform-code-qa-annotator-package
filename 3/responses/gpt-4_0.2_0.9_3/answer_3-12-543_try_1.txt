The error message you're seeing is related to an assertion failure in Flutter's stack trace handling. This is not directly related to your application code, but rather to the environment in which your Flutter app is running.

This error can occur when Flutter is trying to parse a stack trace that doesn't match the expected format. This can happen when running tests or in certain environments where the stack trace format is different from what Flutter expects.

In your case, it seems like the error is occurring when running your app in the web environment (Chrome). This might be due to differences in the stack trace format between the Dart VM (which is used when running on Android) and the JavaScript runtime (which is used when running on the web).

One possible workaround for this issue is to catch and handle errors in your application code, and manually format the stack trace in a way that Flutter can understand. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
Future<void> main() async {
  await runZonedGuarded(
    () async {
      WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
      await Firebase.initializeApp();
      GoRouter.setUrlPathStrategy(UrlPathStrategy.path);
      runApp(const ProviderScope(child: MaterialApp(home: HelloWorld())));
      // ...
    },
    (Object error, StackTrace stack) {
      FlutterError.reportError(FlutterErrorDetails(
        exception: error,
        stack: StackTrace.fromString(stack.toString()),
      ));
    },
  );
}
```

In this code, we're catching any unhandled errors in the `runZonedGuarded` block, and reporting them using `FlutterError.reportError`. This allows us to manually convert the `StackTrace` object to a string and back, which should result in a stack trace format that Flutter can understand.

If this doesn't help, it might be a bug in the Flutter framework itself. In that case, I would recommend filing an issue on the Flutter GitHub repository, including the full error message and a minimal reproduction case if possible.
