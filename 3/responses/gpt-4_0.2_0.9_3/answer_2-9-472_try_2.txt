The error you're encountering is related to the `node-sass` package, which is a library that provides binding for Node.js to LibSass, the C version of the popular stylesheet preprocessor, Sass.

It seems like the version of Node.js you're using on Heroku (v16.13.1) is not compatible with the version of `node-sass` specified in your `package.json` file (v7.0.0).

`node-sass` has been deprecated and is no longer maintained. It's recommended to switch to `sass` (Dart Sass) which is the primary implementation of Sass and will receive all updates and bug fixes.

Here's what you can do:

1. Remove `node-sass` from your project:

```bash
yarn remove node-sass
```

2. Add `sass` to your project:

```bash
yarn add sass
```

3. Update your `package.json` file to reflect the change:

```json
"dependencies": {
  ...
  "sass": "^1.43.4",
  ...
}
```

4. Commit your changes and push to Heroku again.

If you still encounter issues, you might want to specify the Node.js and Yarn versions in the `engines` field of your `package.json` file. This will ensure that Heroku uses the same versions that you're using locally. For example:

```json
"engines": {
  "node": "12.22.7",
  "yarn": "1.22.17"
}
```

Remember to commit your changes before pushing to Heroku.
