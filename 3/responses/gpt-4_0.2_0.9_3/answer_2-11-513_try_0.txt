The MISRA warning you're seeing is because MISRA C:2012 Rule 17.7 states that the value returned by a function having a non-void return type shall be used. `memset()` returns a pointer to the memory area `s` because it's defined as `void *memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);`. 

The MISRA warning is trying to ensure that you're checking the return value of functions that could potentially fail. However, `memset()` is a function that's not expected to fail if passed valid parameters, so it's common to see its return value ignored.

The cast you tried to use `(void)memset(&mystruct, 0, sizeof(MY_STRUCT));` is not correct because it's trying to cast the return value of `memset()` which is a pointer (`void*`) to `void` which is not a pointer type. That's why you're seeing the additional warnings.

In your case, you can safely ignore this MISRA warning because `memset()` is not expected to fail. If you're using a static analysis tool, there should be a way to suppress this specific warning for this line of code.

If you really want to adhere to the MISRA rule, you could do something like this:

```c
void *p = memset(&mystruct, 0, sizeof(MY_STRUCT));
assert(p == &mystruct);
```

This will use the return value of `memset()`, and the `assert()` will check that `memset()` returned the pointer to the start of the structure as expected. Note that `assert()` is typically used for debugging and its behavior depends on the `NDEBUG` macro. If `NDEBUG` is defined, `assert()` does nothing.

In general, to avoid such warnings in the future, always use the return value of functions that return a value. If a function could fail and returns an error code, always check the error code. If a function returns a pointer, always check that the pointer is not `NULL` before using it.
