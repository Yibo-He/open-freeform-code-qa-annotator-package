This error is due to Sprockets 4 requiring a manifest file. Sprockets uses this file to determine which assets to compile.

You can fix this issue by creating a new file at `app/assets/config/manifest.js` and adding the following lines:

```javascript
//= link_tree ../images
//= link_directory ../javascripts .js
//= link_directory ../stylesheets .css
```

These lines tell Sprockets to include all images, JavaScript files, and CSS files in the asset pipeline.

After adding this file, try to boot your Rails app again. If you still encounter issues, you may need to precompile your assets using the command `rake assets:precompile`.
