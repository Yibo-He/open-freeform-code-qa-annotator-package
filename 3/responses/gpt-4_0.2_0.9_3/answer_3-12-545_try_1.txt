The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a JSON body with a POST request, but the body is not properly formatted as JSON. 

In Dart, when you're sending JSON data, you need to encode it using `json.encode()`. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = json.encode({
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
});

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: body,
);
```

This will convert your Dart map into a JSON string, which can then be sent in the body of your POST request.
