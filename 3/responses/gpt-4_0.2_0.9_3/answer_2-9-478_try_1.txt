The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between Devise and Ruby 3.0.0. The method `Module#ref` has been removed in Ruby 3.0.0, which is causing this error. 

Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Ruby 3.0.0. You will need to use Devise 4.7.3 or lower, or wait until a new version of Devise is released that supports Ruby 3.0.0.

To resolve this issue, you can do the following:

1. Specify the version of Devise in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '4.7.3'
```

2. Run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

3. If you still encounter issues, you might need to downgrade your Ruby version to 2.7.2 or lower until Devise releases a version that is compatible with Ruby 3.0.0.

Remember to always check the compatibility of your gems with your current Ruby and Rails version to avoid such issues.
