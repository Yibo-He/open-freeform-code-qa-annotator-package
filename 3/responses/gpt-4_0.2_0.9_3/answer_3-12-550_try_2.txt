It seems like you've done the correct steps to run the AVD in the Android Studio window itself. However, if it's not working as expected, it could be due to a bug or some other issues. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, changes in settings don't take effect until you restart Android Studio. Close the IDE and start it again.

2. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Android Studio. If not, update it. Some older versions might have bugs that have been fixed in newer versions.

3. **Recreate AVD**: Try to delete the current AVD and create a new one. There might be some issues with the current AVD.

4. **Check Flutter and Dart Plugins**: Make sure you have installed and updated Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio.

5. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above steps work, you might want to consider reinstalling Android Studio. There might be some issues with the current installation.

Remember to back up your projects before updating or reinstalling Android Studio.
