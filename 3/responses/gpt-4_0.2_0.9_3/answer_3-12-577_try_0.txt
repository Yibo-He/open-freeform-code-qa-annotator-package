The error message from `flutter doctor` suggests that the Android SDK is not properly installed or the license agreement has not been accepted. This could be the reason why your Flutter project is not building.

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android SDK**: Open Android Studio, go to `Configure -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools`. Check if there are any updates available for Android SDK Build-Tools, Android SDK Platform-Tools, and Android SDK Tools. If there are, install them.

2. **Accept Android Licenses**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Android SDK is installed (usually it's in `Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk` on Mac or `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows). Once you're in the SDK directory, navigate to the `tools/bin` directory and run the command `./sdkmanager --licenses`. Accept all the licenses.

3. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` again in your terminal to see if the issue with the Android toolchain is resolved.

4. **Clean and Rebuild Project**: Go back to your Flutter project directory in the terminal and run `flutter clean` to clean your project. Then try to run your project again with `flutter run`.

If you're still facing issues, it might be helpful to uninstall and reinstall the Android SDK. You can do this through the Android Studio SDK Manager.

Also, make sure that your Flutter SDK and Android SDK paths are correctly set in your environment variables. You can check this by running `echo $PATH` in your terminal.
