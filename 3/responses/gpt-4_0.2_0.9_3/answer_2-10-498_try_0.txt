In Rust, the caret (`^`) operator is not used for exponentiation. It is actually the bitwise XOR operator. 

To perform exponentiation in Rust, you can use the `pow` method from the standard library. Here is how you can raise an integer to a power:

```rust
assert_eq!(2u32.pow(10), 1024);
```

In this example, `2u32.pow(10)` raises 2 to the power of 10, which equals 1024.
