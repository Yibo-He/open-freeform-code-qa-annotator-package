You can use the `?` operator to simplify this code. The `?` operator is used after an expression that returns `Result` or `Option`, and will return early if the `Result` is `Err` or the `Option` is `None`. 

However, the `?` operator can only be used in functions that return `Result` or `Option`. So, you will need to change your function to return `Option<()>` or `Result<(), &'static str>`. 

Here's how you can refactor your code using `?` operator:

```rust
fn main() -> Result<(), &'static str> {
    let i = func1().ok_or("func 1 returned None")?;
    let j = func2(i).ok_or("func 2 returned None")?;
    let k = func3(j).ok_or("func 3 returned None")?;
    let result = func4(k).ok_or("func 4 returned None")?;

    // Do something with result

    Ok(())
}
```

In this code, `ok_or` is used to convert `Option` to `Result`. If the `Option` is `None`, it will return `Err` with the provided error message. If the `Option` is `Some`, it will return `Ok` with the value inside `Some`.

The `?` operator will then check the `Result`. If it's `Ok`, it will take the value out of `Ok` and continue the execution. If it's `Err`, it will return early with the error.

This way, your code is much cleaner and easier to read. The error messages also appear in the same order as the functions that can cause them.
