In Flutter, if you want to align multiple widgets in a single line and want the text to drop to the next line if it increases, you can use the `Wrap` widget instead of `Row`. The `Wrap` widget automatically adjusts its children along both the horizontal and vertical axis.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Text(
      'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this code, `WrapCrossAlignment.center` is used to align the widgets in the center. The `Wrap` widget will automatically move the text to the next line if it doesn't fit on the screen.
