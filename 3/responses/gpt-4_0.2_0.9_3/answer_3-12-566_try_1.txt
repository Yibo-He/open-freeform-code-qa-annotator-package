1. **Update Flutter SDK and Dart Plugin**: Make sure you have the latest version of Flutter SDK and Dart plugin. You can update Flutter SDK by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal and Dart plugin can be updated from Android Studio (Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`).

2. **Reinstall Flutter and Dart Plugin**: If updating doesn't work, try reinstalling Flutter SDK and Dart plugin. Uninstall them first and then install again.

3. **Invalidate Caches / Restart**: Sometimes, Android Studio might have cached some data that could cause problems. Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart` in Android Studio.

4. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It might show some issues that you need to fix.

5. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above solutions work, you might need to reinstall Android Studio. Uninstall it first, then download the latest version from the official website and install it.
