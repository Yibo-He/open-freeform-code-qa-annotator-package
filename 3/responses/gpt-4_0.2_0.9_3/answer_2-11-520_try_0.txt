The error message you're seeing is because the `operator==` in your `SeviceClient` class is not matching the signature of the `operator==` in the base `IClient` class. 

In your `IClient` class, you have declared `operator==` as:
```cpp
virtual bool operator==(const IClient& anotherClient) = 0;
```
This means that any derived class that overrides this function must also accept a `const IClient&` as a parameter.

However, in your `SeviceClient` class, you have declared `operator==` as:
```cpp
bool operator==(const SeviceClient& anotherClient) override;
```
This is not the same signature as the base class function, because it accepts a `const SeviceClient&` instead of a `const IClient&`. This is why the compiler is giving you an error.

When you change the `SeviceClient` `operator==` to accept a `const IClient<int8_t>&`, the signatures match and the compiler is happy.

So, yes, your solution is correct. You need to make sure the signatures of your overridden functions match the base class functions exactly. If you want to compare `SeviceClient` objects specifically, you can do a dynamic cast inside the `operator==` function.

Here is an example of how you might do this:

```cpp
bool operator==(const IClient<int8_t>& anotherClient) override {
    const SeviceClient* anotherServiceClient = dynamic_cast<const SeviceClient*>(&anotherClient);
    if (anotherServiceClient) {
        // Now you can compare SeviceClient objects specifically
        // For example:
        return this->ID == anotherServiceClient->getID();
    } else {
        // Handle the case where anotherClient is not a SeviceClient
        return false;
    }
}
```
