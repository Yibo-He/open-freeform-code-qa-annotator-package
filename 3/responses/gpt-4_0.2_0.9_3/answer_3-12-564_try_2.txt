The error message is pretty clear. It says that you are using the same `AdWidget` in more than one place in your widget tree. 

The `AdWidget` is a widget that wraps an `Ad` object. The `Ad` object is a representation of the ad that is being shown. Each `Ad` object can only be associated with one `AdWidget`. If you try to associate the same `Ad` object with more than one `AdWidget`, you will get the error that you are seeing.

In your case, you are creating a new `AdWidget` for each item in your list, but you are using the same `Ad` object (`posts[index]`) for each of them. This is what is causing the error.

To fix this, you need to make sure that you are creating a new `Ad` object for each `AdWidget`. One way to do this is to create a new `Ad` object in your `itemBuilder` function, like this:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post) {
      return posts[index];
    } else {
      final ad = AdmobService.createBannerAd()..load(); // create a new Ad object
      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: ad),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics()),
);
```

In this code, `AdmobService.createBannerAd()` is a hypothetical function that creates a new `Ad` object. You would need to replace this with your actual function for creating ads.
