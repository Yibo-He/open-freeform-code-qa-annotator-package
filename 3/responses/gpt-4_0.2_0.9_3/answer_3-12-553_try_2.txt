The error message indicates that the Gradle build failed to produce an .aab file. This could be due to several reasons, but one common issue is related to AndroidX incompatibility. 

Here are some steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Migrate to AndroidX**: The warning message suggests that your app isn't using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library and provides backward-compatibility across Android releases. Flutter has adopted AndroidX as the default for new projects, so it's recommended to migrate your project to AndroidX. You can do this by following the steps provided in the warning message.

2. **Check your build.gradle files**: Ensure that your `android/app/build.gradle` file has the correct configuration. The `android` section should look something like this:

    ```
    android {
        compileSdkVersion 28

        sourceSets {
            main.java.srcDirs += 'src/main/kotlin'
        }

        lintOptions {
            disable 'InvalidPackage'
        }

        defaultConfig {
            // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
            applicationId "com.example.app"
            minSdkVersion 16
            targetSdkVersion 28
            versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
            versionName flutterVersionName
            testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        }
    }
    ```

3. **Clean and rebuild your project**: Sometimes, the build process can get stuck due to cached files. You can clean your project by running `flutter clean` in your terminal, and then try to rebuild your project.

4. **Check your Flutter and Dart SDKs**: Make sure you have the latest stable versions of Flutter and Dart SDKs. You can upgrade Flutter by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal.

If none of the above solutions work, it would be helpful to have more information about your project configuration and the exact steps you're taking to build your app.
