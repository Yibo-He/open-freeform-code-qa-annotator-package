The `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute is used to suppress the compiler warning for unused code. However, it is typically used for functions, structs, enums, etc. and not for variables.

In your case, you are trying to use it for a variable `x` which is not used anywhere in the code. The Rust compiler will still give a warning for this.

If you want to suppress the warning for an unused variable, you can use an underscore `_` before the variable name:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 0;
}
```

This tells the Rust compiler that you intentionally did not use the variable `x`.
