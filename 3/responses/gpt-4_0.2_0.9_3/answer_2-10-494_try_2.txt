Rust-analyzer is a very useful tool for Rust development, but it's not perfect and sometimes it may show false positives or negatives. It's important to remember that rust-analyzer and rustc (the official Rust compiler) are two different tools. Rust-analyzer aims to provide a rich IDE experience, while rustc is the official Rust compiler. They have different goals and sometimes their behavior may differ.

The error you're seeing seems to be a false positive from rust-analyzer. If your code compiles and passes tests with `cargo build` and `cargo test`, then it's likely that your code is fine.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: Make sure you're using the latest version of rust-analyzer. The tool is under active development and bugs are fixed regularly.

2. **Check your Rust toolchain**: Make sure you're using the latest stable Rust toolchain. You can update your toolchain with `rustup update`.

3. **Check your project configuration**: Make sure your project is correctly configured for rust-analyzer. You can check the [rust-analyzer manual](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) for more information on how to configure your project.

4. **Report the issue**: If none of the above solutions work, consider reporting the issue to the rust-analyzer team. They're very responsive and might be able to help you resolve the issue. You can report issues on the [rust-analyzer GitHub page](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues).

Remember, if your code compiles and passes tests, then it's likely correct, even if rust-analyzer is showing an error.
