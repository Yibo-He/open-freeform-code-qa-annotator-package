1. Why doesn't this compile in C?

The code doesn't compile in C because C requires that variables be declared at the beginning of a block (a section of code enclosed in braces `{}`). In your code, you're trying to declare a variable `a` in the middle of an `if` statement, which is not a block. This is not allowed in C.

2. Why does this difference exist?

The difference exists because C++ has more relaxed rules about where variables can be declared compared to C. In C++, you can declare a variable at the point of first use, which can be in the middle of a block or a conditional statement like an `if` statement. This is not allowed in C.

This difference is one of many that exist between C and C++ due to the evolution of the languages. C++ was originally developed as an extension of C with additional features like classes and objects for object-oriented programming. Over time, other features and changes were added to C++ that are not present in C, including the ability to declare variables at the point of first use.
