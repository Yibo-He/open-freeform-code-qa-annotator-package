The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled. This is a warning, not an error, so your application should still function correctly. However, it's always a good idea to follow best security practices, even in a development environment.

If you want to disable this warning, you can add the following line to your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
```

This will disable the built-in security features and should remove the warning.

The `elasticsearch.yml` file is typically located in the `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory if you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew. If you can't find it, you can use the `find` command to locate it:

```bash
find / -name "elasticsearch.yml"
```

If you want to enable the security features, the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility is part of the Elasticsearch package and should be located in the `/usr/share/elasticsearch/bin/` directory. However, this utility might not be available if you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew. In that case, you would need to download and install Elasticsearch directly from the official website.

Remember to restart your Elasticsearch service after making any changes to the configuration file:

```bash
brew services restart elasticsearch
```
