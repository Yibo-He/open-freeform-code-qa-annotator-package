The error you're seeing is due to the fact that you're trying to access the application's documents directory before the Flutter engine is fully initialized. 

In Flutter, the `main()` function cannot be asynchronous, because Flutter needs to ensure that the engine is fully initialized before any other code is run. 

To solve this, you can use `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();` before calling any asynchronous code in your `main()` function. This ensures that the Flutter engine is fully initialized before you try to access the application's documents directory.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

This should solve the error you're seeing.
