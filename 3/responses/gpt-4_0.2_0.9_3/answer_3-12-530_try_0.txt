Yes, you are correct. The error is because the `Map` indexing operation can return `null` if the key is not found, and `int.parse` does not accept `null` as an argument. Your solution is correct, but it can be a bit verbose if you have to do it for many variables.

Creating a function to handle this conversion can make your code cleaner and more maintainable. Here's an example of how you could do it:

```dart
int? parseToInt(String? value) {
  if (value != null) {
    return int.parse(value);
  }
  return null;
}
```

Then, you can use this function to parse your values:

```dart
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
int? id = parseToInt(routeArgs["id"]);
```

This way, if `routeArgs["id"]` is `null`, `parseToInt` will return `null` and `id` will be `null`. If `routeArgs["id"]` is not `null`, `parseToInt` will parse it to an `int` and `id` will hold that `int` value.
