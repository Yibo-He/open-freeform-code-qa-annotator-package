Yes, they are essentially the same, but they are used in different scenarios.

1. `Provider.of<Model>(context, listen: false)` is equivalent to `context.read<Model>()`. Both are used to fetch data but not listen to it. This means that they won't cause the widget to rebuild when the model changes.

2. `Provider.of<Model>(context)` is equivalent to `context.watch<Model>()`. Both are used to fetch and listen to the data. This means that they will cause the widget to rebuild when the model changes.

The error you're seeing is because `context.read()` should not be used inside the `build()` method. The reason is that `context.read()` is not meant to be used in methods that might potentially be called multiple times during the lifecycle of a widget. 

The `build()` method is one of those methods that can be called multiple times, and using `context.read()` inside it can lead to unexpected behavior. 

On the other hand, `Provider.of()` is safe to use in the `build()` method because it's designed to handle being called multiple times.

In short, use `context.read()` when you want to access a value but don't need the widget to rebuild when that value changes. But don't use it inside the `build()` method or any method that might be called multiple times during the lifecycle of a widget.
