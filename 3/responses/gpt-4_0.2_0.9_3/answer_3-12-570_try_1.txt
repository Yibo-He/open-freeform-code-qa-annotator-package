The issue seems to be with the indentation in your `pubspec.yaml` file. YAML files are sensitive to indentation and spaces, so you need to be careful with the structure. 

Here's the corrected version of your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: jsondata 
description: A new Flutter application.

dependencies:  
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:   
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

In YAML, lists are denoted by a hyphen (-) and indentation. Make sure that the `assets:` field is indented correctly under `flutter:` and the path to your json file is indented under `assets:`. Also, ensure that there are no trailing spaces after the path to your json file.
