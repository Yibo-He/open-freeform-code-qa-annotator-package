The problem you're facing might be due to the Flutter plugin in Android Studio. There are a few things you can try to solve this issue:

1. **Update Flutter and Dart plugins**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio. You can check this by going to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`.

2. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure your Android Studio is up-to-date. You can check for updates by going to `Help -> Check for Updates`.

3. **Reinstall Flutter plugin**: If updating doesn't help, try reinstalling the Flutter plugin. Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, uninstall the Flutter plugin, restart Android Studio, and then reinstall the plugin.

4. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` in the terminal to see if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. If there are, follow the instructions provided to fix them.

5. **Create a new AVD**: Sometimes, the problem might be with the AVD itself. Try creating a new AVD and see if the problem persists.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug with the Flutter plugin or Android Studio. In that case, you might want to report the issue on the Flutter GitHub page.
