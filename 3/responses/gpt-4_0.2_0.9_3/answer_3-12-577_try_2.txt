The error message from `flutter doctor` indicates that the Android SDK isn't properly installed or the license agreement hasn't been accepted. This could be the reason why your Flutter project isn't running.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android SDK:** Open Android Studio, go to `Configure -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools`. Make sure that the `Android SDK Command-line Tools` is installed. If not, install it. If it's already installed, you might want to try updating it.

2. **Accept Android Licenses:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Android SDK is installed. This is usually in `Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk` on Mac, and `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows. Once you're in the SDK directory, navigate to the `tools/bin` directory and run the command `./sdkmanager --licenses`. Accept all the licenses.

3. **Set Android SDK Path:** Make sure that the Android SDK path is correctly set in your environment variables. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username. If you're on Windows, replace the paths with the appropriate Windows paths.

4. **Update Flutter:** Run `flutter doctor -v` to check for any other issues. If everything is fine, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter run` to see if your project runs.

If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your development environment (OS, Flutter version, Android Studio version, etc.) so I can give a more accurate solution.
