You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the specified character. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_a = a.split('|')

# Get the first part
first_part = split_a[0]

print(first_part)
```

This will output:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. In this case, it splits the string at each '|' character. The first item in the list (index 0) is the part of the string before the first '|'.
