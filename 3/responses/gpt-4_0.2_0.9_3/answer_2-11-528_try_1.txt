You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false` in your `.clang-format` or `_clang-format` file. 

Here is an example of how to do it:

```yaml
---
Language:        Cpp
# BasedOnStyle:  Google
SortIncludes:    false
...
```

This will prevent `clang-format` from sorting your `#include` directives. 

The `SortIncludes` option is `true` by default in many of the predefined styles, like LLVM, Google, Chromium, Mozilla, and WebKit. So, if you are using one of these styles as a base, you need to explicitly set `SortIncludes` to `false` to disable include sorting.
