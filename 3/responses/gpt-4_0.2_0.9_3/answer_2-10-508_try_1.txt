The `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute is used to suppress the compiler warning for unused functions or methods. However, in your case, you are trying to use it for a local variable `x` which is not used anywhere in your code. 

The Rust compiler does not allow the use of `#[allow(dead_code)]` for local variables. It is used for functions, structs, enums, etc., but not for local variables. 

If you want to suppress the warning for an unused variable, you can use an underscore `_` before the variable name. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let _x = 0;
}
```

This tells the Rust compiler that you intentionally did not use the variable `x`.
