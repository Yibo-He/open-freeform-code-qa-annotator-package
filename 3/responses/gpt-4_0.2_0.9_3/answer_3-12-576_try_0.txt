You can use the `split()` method in Dart (the language used in Flutter) to split the string into a list of substrings based on a specific character. Then, you can simply take the first element of the list. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
String str = 'one.two';
List<String> strParts = str.split('.');
String firstPart = strParts[0]; // 'one'
```

In this code, `str.split('.')` splits the string into a list of substrings at each point where it finds a '.'. The resulting list is `['one', 'two']`. Then, `strParts[0]` gets the first element of the list, which is the part of the string before the '.'.

If you want to make it in one line, you can do it like this:

```dart
String firstPart = 'one.two'.split('.')[0]; // 'one'
```

This will give you the same result.
