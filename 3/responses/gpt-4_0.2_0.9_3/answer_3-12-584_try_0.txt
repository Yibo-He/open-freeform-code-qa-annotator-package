The issue you're experiencing could be due to a number of reasons. Here are a few things you can try to resolve it:

1. **Check your device's settings**: Make sure that your device allows installations from unknown sources. You can usually find this option in the security settings of your device.

2. **Check your USB connection**: Make sure that your device is properly connected to your computer. Try using a different USB cable or port if possible.

3. **Try a different device or emulator**: If you have another device or an emulator, try running your app on it to see if the problem persists.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project**: Sometimes, cleaning and rebuilding your project can solve issues like this. You can do this by running the following commands in your terminal:

   ```
   $ flutter clean
   $ flutter run
   ```

5. **Update Flutter and Dart**: Make sure that you're using the latest versions of Flutter and Dart. You can update Flutter by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal.

6. **Check for error messages**: Look for any error messages in your terminal or in the console of your IDE. These messages can give you clues about what's going wrong.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to consider posting a question on a site like Stack Overflow. Be sure to include as much information as possible about your issue, including the exact error message you're seeing, the version of Flutter and Dart you're using, and any other relevant details.
