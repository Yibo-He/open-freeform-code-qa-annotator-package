In Flutter, if a text overflows, it will automatically wrap and create a new line. However, if you want to manually create a new line in a string, you can use `\n`.

For example:

```dart
String myString = 'This is line 1\nThis is line 2';
```

In your case, if you want to manually add a new line in your text, you can do something like this:

```dart
"${text[0]}\n${text[1]}"
```

This will create a new line between `text[0]` and `text[1]`.

However, if your text is not wrapping as expected, it might be due to the `AutoSizeText` widget or the `Container` widget. You can try to wrap your `AutoSizeText` widget with `Expanded` widget to make sure it takes the available space and wraps the text correctly.

```dart
Expanded(
  child: AutoSizeText(
    "${text[0]}",
    style: TextStyle(fontFamily: 'quran', fontSize: 30),
    textAlign: TextAlign.end,
  ),
),
```

Also, make sure that the `Container` widget has enough width to display the text. If the width is too small, the text might not wrap correctly. You can use `MediaQuery` to get the width of the screen and set the width of the `Container` accordingly.

```dart
double width = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
```

Then you can use this width for your `Container`:

```dart
Container(
  width: width,
  child: // your widgets
),
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
