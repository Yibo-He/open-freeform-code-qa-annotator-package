The error message you're seeing indicates that Ruby is unable to load the OpenSSL library. This is likely because Ruby was not correctly linked to OpenSSL when it was installed.

Here are the steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. First, you need to install the OpenSSL package. If you're using a Mac, you can do this with Homebrew:

   ```
   brew install openssl
   ```

   If you're using Ubuntu, you can use apt-get:

   ```
   sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
   ```

2. Once OpenSSL is installed, you need to reinstall Ruby with RVM and specify the path to OpenSSL. If you installed OpenSSL with Homebrew, the command would look like this:

   ```
   rvm reinstall 2.1.2 --with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl`
   ```

   If you installed OpenSSL with apt-get, the command would look like this:

   ```
   rvm reinstall 2.1.2 --with-openssl-dir=/usr/include/openssl
   ```

3. After Ruby is reinstalled, you should be able to use OpenSSL without any issues. You can verify this by running the command you provided:

   ```
   ruby -r openssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION'
   ```

   If everything is working correctly, this command should print the version of OpenSSL that Ruby is using.

Please try these steps and let me know if you have any issues.
