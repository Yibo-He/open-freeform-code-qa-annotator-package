The error message is telling you that the context you're using to call `showDialog` is not a descendant of a `Navigator` widget. This is because the `BuildContext` represents a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree. The `BuildContext` argument to the `build` method is the context of the `Widget` that is returned by the `build` method.

In Flutter, you cannot show a dialog in the `build` method directly because at the time the `build` method is processed, the widget is not yet fully integrated into the widget tree, hence it doesn't have any `Navigator` in its context yet.

To solve this, you can use `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to add a callback that is called after the current frame has been dispatched. Here is an example:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    if (flag) { // replace flag with your condition
      _showDialog();
    }
  });
}
```

This way, the dialog will be shown after the widget is built and the flag condition is met. Make sure to replace `flag` with your actual condition.

Also, remember to call `super.initState();` at the beginning of your `initState` method to correctly initialize the state.
