The warning message you're seeing is because Elasticsearch 7.13.1 has built-in security features that are not enabled by default. As you mentioned, this is just for your development machine, so you might not need these security features. 

To disable the warning, you can add the following lines to your `elasticsearch.yml` configuration file:

```yml
xpack.security.enabled: false
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: false
```

The `elasticsearch.yml` file is usually located in the `/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch` directory if you installed Elasticsearch with Homebrew.

After adding these lines, you need to restart Elasticsearch for the changes to take effect. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
brew services restart elasticsearch
```

If you want to enable the security features, you would need to install Elasticsearch from the official Elasticsearch distribution, not from Homebrew. The `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility is not included in the Homebrew version of Elasticsearch. You can download the official distribution from the Elasticsearch website.
