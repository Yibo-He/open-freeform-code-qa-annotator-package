To darken or lighten a color, you can use the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) color model. You can convert the RGB color to HSL, adjust the lightness, and then convert it back to RGB.

Here's how you can do it in Dart:

```dart
import 'dart:ui';

Color darken(Color color, [double amount = .1]) {
  final hsl = HSLColor.fromColor(color);
  final hslDark = hsl.withLightness((hsl.lightness - amount).clamp(0.0, 1.0));

  return hslDark.toColor();
}

Color lighten(Color color, [double amount = .1]) {
  final hsl = HSLColor.fromColor(color);
  final hslLight = hsl.withLightness((hsl.lightness + amount).clamp(0.0, 1.0));

  return hslLight.toColor();
}

void main() {
  final color = Color(0xff159424);

  print(darken(color).value.toRadixString(16)); // print the darkened color
  print(lighten(color).value.toRadixString(16)); // print the lightened color
}
```

In the above code, `darken` and `lighten` functions take a `Color` object and an optional `amount` parameter that determines how much the color should be darkened or lightened. The `amount` is a fraction between 0 and 1, where 1 corresponds to black or white, respectively.

The `Color` object is created from the hex color code. The `HSLColor.fromColor` method is used to convert the color to HSL. The lightness is then adjusted with the `withLightness` method. The adjusted color is converted back to a `Color` object with the `toColor` method.

The `clamp` method is used to ensure that the lightness stays within the valid range (0.0 - 1.0).

The `main` function demonstrates how to use these functions. It creates a `Color` object from the hex color code, darkens and lightens the color, and then prints the hex color codes of the resulting colors.

Please note that Dart's `Color` class uses ARGB format, so you need to add `ff` at the beginning of your color code to represent full opacity.
