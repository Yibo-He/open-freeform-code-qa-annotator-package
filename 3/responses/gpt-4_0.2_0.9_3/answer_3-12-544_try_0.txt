The error you're encountering is due to the fact that you're trying to access platform-specific functionality before the Flutter engine is fully initialized. This is because the `main()` function is the entry point of your app, and Flutter hasn't fully initialized at this point.

To solve this issue, you need to ensure that the Flutter engine is fully initialized before calling `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()`. You can do this by using the `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
void main() async {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized();
  final appDocsDir = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(appDocsDir.path);
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

The `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` method ensures that the Flutter engine is fully up and running, which allows you to safely call `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` and avoid the error you're encountering.
