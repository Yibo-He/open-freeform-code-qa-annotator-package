The error message is indicating that you have a `ListView` (which is a type of `ScrollView`) inside a `Column` without a fixed height. This is causing the `ListView` to try and expand infinitely, which is not allowed.

The `ListView.builder` widget is trying to expand as much as it can (which is infinite in this case), but it can't provide a finite height to its children. 

You can solve this by wrapping your `ListView.builder` in a `Container` with a fixed height or by using `Expanded` widget. 

Here is an example of how you can do it:

```dart
new Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: new ListView.builder(
        itemCount: products.length,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext ctxt, int index) {
          return new Text(products[index]);
        }
      ),
    ),
    new IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.remove_circle),
      onPressed: () { },
    )
  ],
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
),
```

In this case, `Expanded` widget will take up the remaining space in the `Row` for the `ListView.builder`.

If you want to give a specific height to the `ListView.builder`, you can use a `Container`:

```dart
new Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Container(
      height: 200.0,
      child: new ListView.builder(
        itemCount: products.length,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext ctxt, int index) {
          return new Text(products[index]);
        }
      ),
    ),
    new IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.remove_circle),
      onPressed: () { },
    )
  ],
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
),
```

In this case, `ListView.builder` will have a height of 200 pixels.
