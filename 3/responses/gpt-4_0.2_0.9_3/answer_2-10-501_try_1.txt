The error message you're seeing is indicating that the code is trying to use async functionality outside of an async runtime. The Tokio runtime is not being initialized properly.

The issue is likely due to the version of `tokio` you're using. The `mdns` crate requires `tokio` version 0.2.x, but you're using version 0.3.3. 

Try changing your `tokio` dependency in your `Cargo.toml` to use version 0.2.x with the full feature set:

```toml
[dependencies]
mdns = "1.1.0"
futures-util = "0.3.8"
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

Then run `cargo update` to update your dependencies, and try running your code again. This should resolve the issue. 

If you still encounter the same error after making these changes, please let me know so I can help you troubleshoot further.
