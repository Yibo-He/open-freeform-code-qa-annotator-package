The error message you're seeing is indicating that the ffi gem is unable to find the libffi.so.6 library. This is likely because the upgrade to your OS included an upgrade to libffi, which may have removed or replaced the version the ffi gem was expecting.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. Check the installed version of libffi:

```bash
dpkg -l | grep libffi
```

If libffi.so.6 is not listed, it means that it's not installed on your system.

2. If libffi.so.6 is not installed, you can try to install it with:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

3. If the above command doesn't work or libffi.so.6 is already installed, you may need to reinstall the ffi gem. First, uninstall the ffi gem:

```bash
gem uninstall ffi
```

Then reinstall it:

```bash
gem install ffi
```

4. If the issue persists, it may be due to the version of Ruby you're using. You can try updating Ruby to the latest version with rbenv:

```bash
rbenv install 2.7.2
rbenv global 2.7.2
```

Then reinstall the ffi gem:

```bash
gem install ffi
```

5. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to create a symbolic link to the libffi.so.6 file. First, find the location of the file with:

```bash
locate libffi.so
```

Then create a symbolic link to it in /usr/lib:

```bash
sudo ln -s /path/to/your/libffi.so.6 /usr/lib
```

Replace "/path/to/your/libffi.so.6" with the actual path to the file.

Remember to restart your terminal or source your bashrc/zshrc file to make sure the changes take effect. If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please let me know!
