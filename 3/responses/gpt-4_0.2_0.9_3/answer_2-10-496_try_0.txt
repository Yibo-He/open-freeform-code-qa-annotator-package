You can use the `sort_by` method to sort by multiple keys. This method takes a closure that returns an `Ordering` for two elements. You can use the `cmp` method on tuples to compare both the `row` and `column` fields.

Here is an example:

```rust
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| (a.row, a.column).cmp(&(b.row, b.column)));
```

This will sort your vector first by `row` and then by `column`. If two elements have the same `row`, they will be sorted by `column`. If they also have the same `column`, they will be considered equal for the purposes of sorting.
