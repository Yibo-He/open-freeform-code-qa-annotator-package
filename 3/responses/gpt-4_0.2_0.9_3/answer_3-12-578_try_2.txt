In Flutter, the `const` keyword is used to represent a compile-time constant. Flutter needs to know the value at compile time, not at runtime. 

When you use `const` before `Text` widget, it means you are creating a constant `Text` widget. All the properties of this widget should also be constant. That's why you're getting an error when you're trying to use a non-constant `textSize` for the `fontSize`.

If you want to use a variable for `fontSize`, you should remove the `const` keyword before `Text` widget. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
var textSize = 10.0;
// or
double textSize = 10.0;

child: Text('Calculate Client Fees',
            style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```

In this case, the `Text` widget is not a constant and it can have non-constant properties.
