The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a `Map` directly as the body of a `POST` request with `Content-Type` set to `application/json`. However, the `http` package doesn't automatically encode `Map` to a JSON string. You need to manually encode the `Map` to a JSON string using `jsonEncode` from `dart:convert`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = jsonEncode({
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
});

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: body,
);
```

This should resolve the error you're facing.
