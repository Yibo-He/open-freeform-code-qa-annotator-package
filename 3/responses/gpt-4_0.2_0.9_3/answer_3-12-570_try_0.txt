The issue seems to be with the indentation in your `pubspec.yaml` file. YAML files are sensitive to indentation and spaces. Here is the corrected version of your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
name: jsondata 
description: A new Flutter application.

dependencies:  
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:   
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

Please make sure that the `flutter:` and `assets:` fields are not indented under `dev_dependencies:`. Also, the path to your assets should be indented under `assets:`. 

After correcting the `pubspec.yaml` file, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to update your dependencies.
