The error message is indicating that it can't find the Android Gradle plugin version 5.6.2. However, as of now, the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin is 4.2.1. It seems like you've specified a wrong version in your build.gradle file.

In your project level build.gradle file, replace:

```gradle
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

with:

```gradle
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.2.1'
```

Also, make sure that your Gradle wrapper is using a compatible version. For Android Gradle plugin 4.2.1, Gradle 6.7.1 or higher is required. You can change this in your gradle-wrapper.properties file:

```properties
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-6.7.1-all.zip
```

After making these changes, try to clean and rebuild your project. If you're using the terminal, you can do this with the following commands:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter run
```

If you're still facing issues, please make sure that your Android Studio is up-to-date, and that you've installed the latest Flutter and Dart plugins.
