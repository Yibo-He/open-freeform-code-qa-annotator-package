The error message you're seeing is due to a missing library in Ruby 3.0.0. The library `rexml` is a default gem in Ruby 3.0.0, but it's not automatically required when Ruby starts up. The `kramdown` gem, which is a dependency of Jekyll, needs `rexml` and is trying to require it, but it's not finding it because it's not automatically loaded in Ruby 3.0.0.

You can solve this issue by adding `gem 'rexml'` to your Gemfile. This will ensure that the `rexml` gem is included in your bundle when you run `bundle install`.

Here's what your Gemfile should look like after adding `gem 'rexml'`:

```ruby
source "https://rubygems.org"
gem 'jekyll-scholar', group: :jekyll_plugins
gem 'rexml'

# If you want to use GitHub Pages, remove the "gem "jekyll"" above and
# uncomment the line below. To upgrade, run `bundle update github-pages`.
gem "github-pages", "~> 204", group: :jekyll_plugins

# If you have any plugins, put them here!
group :jekyll_plugins do
  gem "jekyll-feed", "~> 0.6"
end

# Windows does not include zoneinfo files, so bundle the tzinfo-data gem
gem "tzinfo-data", platforms: [:mingw, :mswin, :x64_mingw, :jruby]

# Performance-booster for watching directories on Windows
gem "wdm", "~> 0.1.0" if Gem.win_platform?
```

After you've added `gem 'rexml'` to your Gemfile, run `bundle install` again to install the `rexml` gem. Then try running `bundle exec jekyll serve` again. It should work now.
