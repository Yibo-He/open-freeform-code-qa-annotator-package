The `anchor_spl::token::transfer` function is used to transfer SPL tokens, not native SOL. For transferring native SOL, you should use the `solana_program::system_instruction::transfer` function.

Here is an example of how you can use it:

```rust
let transfer_instruction = solana_program::system_instruction::transfer(
    &source_user_info.key, // sender's public key
    &destination_user_info.key, // receiver's public key
    lamports, // amount of SOL in lamports to transfer
);
```

In this instruction, `source_user_info.key` is the public key of the sender's account, `destination_user_info.key` is the public key of the receiver's account, and `lamports` is the amount of SOL to transfer, in lamports (1 SOL = 1_000_000_000 lamports).

After creating the instruction, you need to send it to the Solana network. You can do this using the `solana_program::program::invoke` function, or by adding the instruction to a transaction that you send to the network.

Please note that the sender's account must be signed, i.e., it must be included in the transaction's list of signers.

As for the `PROGRAM_ACCOUNT` in your code, it should be the program ID of the SPL Token program, which is used to handle SPL token transfers. But as I mentioned, you don't use this for transferring native SOL.
