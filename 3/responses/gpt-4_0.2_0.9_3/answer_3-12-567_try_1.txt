You can use `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to align your widgets in a row. This will place the maximum space between the main axis of each child. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: [
      Row(
        children: [
          Container(
            child: Icon(Icons.comment),
            margin: EdgeInsets.only(left: 5.0),
          ),
          Container(
            child: Text(snapshot.data![index].comments.toString(),
                style: TextStyle(
                    fontSize: 14.0, fontWeight: FontWeight.bold)),
            margin: EdgeInsets.only(left: 5.0),
          ),
        ],
      ),
      Align(
        alignment: Alignment.topRight,
        child: Text(snapshot.data![index].date.toString()),
      )
    ]),
```

In this code, I have nested a `Row` widget inside another `Row` widget. The `mainAxisAlignment` property of the outer `Row` widget is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween`, which will place the maximum space between the main axis of each child. The first two widgets (Icon and Text) are placed inside the inner `Row` widget, so they will be grouped together on the left side. The `Align` widget is placed on the right side.
