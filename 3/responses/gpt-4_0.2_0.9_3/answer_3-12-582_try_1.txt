Yes, they are equivalent in terms of functionality but they are used in different scenarios.

1. `Provider.of<Model>(context, listen: false)` is equivalent to `context.read<Model>()`. Both are used to fetch data but they don't listen to changes in the provider. 

2. `Provider.of<Model>(context)` is equivalent to `context.watch<Model>()`. Both are used to fetch data and they will also listen to changes in the provider.

The error you're getting is because `context.read()` is not supposed to be used inside the `build()` method. The `build()` method can potentially be called many times and is not a good place to read a provider if you don't want to listen to it. 

`context.read()` is mainly used for performing actions (like calling a function in the model), not for updating the UI based on the model's state. If you want to update the UI based on the model's state, you should use `context.watch()` or `Provider.of(context)` instead.

On the other hand, `Provider.of(context, listen: false)` can be used inside `build()` method because it explicitly tells the provider not to listen to changes. This is useful when you want to fetch data once and don't care about further updates.
