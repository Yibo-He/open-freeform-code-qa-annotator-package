In Flutter, if a string overflows, it should automatically wrap to the next line. However, if you want to manually add a new line in a string, you can use `\n`.

For example:

```dart
String myString = 'This is line 1\nThis is line 2';
```

In your case, if you want to add a new line in the text from the JSON file, you can do something like this:

```dart
String myText = quranText['sura'][widget.surahDipilih]['aya'][index]['_text'];
myText = myText.replaceAll(' ', ' \n');
```

This will add a new line after each space in the text.

However, if your text is not wrapping to the next line as expected, it might be due to the constraints of the parent widget. In your case, you are using `AutoSizeText` widget, which automatically scales the text to fit within its bounds. If the text is too long to fit within its bounds, it will be scaled down to fit.

You can try to wrap your `AutoSizeText` widget with `Expanded` widget to give it flexible space and allow it to wrap the text:

```dart
Expanded(
  child: AutoSizeText(
    "${text[0]}",
    style: TextStyle(
      fontFamily: 'quran', 
      fontSize: 30
    ),
    textAlign: TextAlign.end,
  )
)
```

Also, make sure that the parent `Row` widget has enough space to accommodate the text. If the `Row` widget is too narrow, the text might not wrap as expected. You can try to increase the width of the `Row` widget or use a `Column` widget instead if the layout allows it.
