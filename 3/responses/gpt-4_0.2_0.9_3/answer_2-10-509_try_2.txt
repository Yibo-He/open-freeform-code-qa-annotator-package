You can use the `chunks` method to split your vector into chunks of 2 elements and then collect them into a HashMap. Here is a one-liner solution in Rust:

```rust
let map: HashMap<_, _> = vec.chunks(2).map(|chunk| (chunk[0].to_string(), chunk[1].to_string())).collect();
```

This will create a HashMap where the keys are the 0th, 2nd, 4th, etc. elements of your vector and the values are the 1st, 3rd, 5th, etc. elements.

Please note that this will panic if your vector has an odd length. If you want to handle this case, you can add a check before creating the HashMap.
