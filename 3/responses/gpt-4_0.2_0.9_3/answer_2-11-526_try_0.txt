1. Why doesn't this compile in C?

The code snippet you provided doesn't compile in C because C does not allow variable declarations to occur within the condition of an `if` statement. In C, all variables must be declared at the beginning of a block (a section of code enclosed in `{}`), before any executable statements.

In your code, `int a = 2;` is a declaration statement, which is not allowed in the conditional part of an `if` statement in C.

2. Why does this difference exist?

This difference exists due to the evolution of the two languages and their different design philosophies. 

C++ was designed to be more flexible and to support a wider range of programming styles than C. One of the ways it achieves this is by allowing variable declarations to occur almost anywhere, not just at the start of a block. This includes within the condition of an `if` statement.

In contrast, C was designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Requiring all variables to be declared at the start of a block makes the language simpler and easier to implement, but it also makes the language less flexible.

So, in summary, this difference exists because C++ chose to prioritize flexibility and expressiveness, while C chose to prioritize simplicity and efficiency.
