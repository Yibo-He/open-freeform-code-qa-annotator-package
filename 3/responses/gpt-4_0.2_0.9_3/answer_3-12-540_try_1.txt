Yes, you can draw vertical lines between components in Flutter. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget or the `Container` widget with a specified height and width.

Here is an example of how you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 1')),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 2')),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `VerticalDivider` widget creates a vertical line between two text widgets.

If you want to use the `Container` widget to create a vertical line, you can do it like this:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 1')),
    Container(
      height: double.infinity,
      width: 2,
      color: Colors.black,
    ),
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 2')),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Container` widget creates a vertical line between two text widgets. You can adjust the height, width, and color of the line as needed.
