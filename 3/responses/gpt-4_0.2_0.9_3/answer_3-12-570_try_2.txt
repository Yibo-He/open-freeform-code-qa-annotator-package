The formatting of your `pubspec.yaml` file is incorrect. The `flutter:` and `assets:` fields are not properly indented. Here's the corrected version:

```yaml
name: jsondata 
description: A new Flutter application.

dependencies:  
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:   
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

In YAML files, indentation is crucial. It's used to determine the structure of the data. The `flutter:` and `assets:` fields should be at the same level of indentation, and the path to your assets should be indented under the `assets:` field. 

Also, ensure that the path to your JSON file is correct and that the file exists at that location. The path is relative to the location of the `pubspec.yaml` file. If your file is not in the `loadjson` directory at the root of your project, you'll need to update the path.
