This issue might be due to several reasons such as a network problem, a problem with the Flutter SDK, or an issue with Android Studio itself. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, simply restarting Android Studio can solve the problem.

2. **Update Flutter and Dart plugins**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Flutter and Dart plugins. You can check this by going to `File > Settings > Plugins` in Android Studio.

3. **Update Flutter SDK**: Open your terminal and run `flutter upgrade` to make sure you have the latest version of Flutter SDK.

4. **Check your internet connection**: The Flutter Inspector needs to download the DevTools package from the internet. Make sure your internet connection is stable.

5. **Manually install Flutter DevTools**: You can try to manually install Flutter DevTools by running `flutter pub global activate devtools` in your terminal. After that, you can start DevTools by running `flutter pub global run devtools`.

6. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above solutions work, you might need to reinstall Android Studio.

Remember to restart your IDE after each step to check if the problem is solved.
