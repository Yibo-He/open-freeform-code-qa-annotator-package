You can use the `weekday` property of `DateTime` object to get the day of the week as an integer where 1 represents Monday and 7 represents Sunday. Then you can convert this integer to the name of the day of the week.

However, if you want to get the name of the day directly, you can use the `DateFormat` class from the `intl` package. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now();
  String dayName = DateFormat('EEEE').format(date);
  print(dayName);
}
```

In this code, 'EEEE' represents the full name of the day of the week. The `DateFormat` class uses the ICU format patterns. You can find more information about these patterns in the [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).

Remember to add the `intl` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: ^0.17.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.
