The error message indicates that there is an unexpected character at the beginning of the JSON response. The character "ï»¿" is a Byte Order Mark (BOM) for UTF-8. It seems like your PHP script is returning a JSON response encoded in UTF-8 with BOM.

You can remove the BOM from the response before decoding it in Dart. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async{
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url ="http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
      url,
      headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
      body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
      encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
  );

  // Remove BOM from response body
  String responseBody = response.body;
  if (responseBody.codeUnitAt(0) == 65279) {
    responseBody = responseBody.substring(1);
  }

  List data = json.decode(responseBody);
}
```

This code checks if the first character of the response body is a BOM (65279 is the Unicode value of the BOM in UTF-8), and if it is, it removes it before decoding the JSON.

On the PHP side, you can also prevent the BOM from being included in the first place by setting the charset to 'utf-8' in the 'Content-type' header, like this:

```php
header('Content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8');
```

This tells the client that the response is in UTF-8 encoding without a BOM.
