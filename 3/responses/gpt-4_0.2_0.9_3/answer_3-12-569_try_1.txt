The `builder` parameter in `ChangeNotifierProvider` has been deprecated and replaced with `create`. So, you should replace `builder` with `create` in your code.

Here is how you can modify your code:

```dart
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()),
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This change was made to make the API more consistent with other parts of the Flutter framework. The `create` parameter is more descriptive of its purpose, which is to create a new instance of a `ChangeNotifier`.
