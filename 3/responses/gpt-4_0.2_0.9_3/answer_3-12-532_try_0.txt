The error you're seeing is due to the presence of a Byte Order Mark (BOM) at the start of your JSON response. The BOM is a Unicode character used to signal the endianness (byte order) of a text file or stream. Its presence can cause issues when parsing the file or stream as JSON.

In your case, the BOM is likely being added by your PHP script or the text editor you're using to write your PHP script. You can remove it by doing the following:

1. Open your PHP script in a text editor that allows you to specify the encoding when saving files (like Notepad++ or Sublime Text).
2. Save the file with the encoding set to UTF-8 without BOM.

If you can't remove the BOM for some reason, you can also modify your Dart code to ignore it when parsing the JSON response:

```dart
Future<String> iniciarSesion() async{
  var usuario = textUsuario.text;
  var password = textPassword.text;
  var nombreUsuario;
  var url ="http://192.168.1.37/usuario.php";

  //Metodo post
  var response = await http.post(
      url,
      headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
      body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
      encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
  );

  // Remove BOM from response body
  String responseBody = response.body;
  if (responseBody.codeUnitAt(0) == 65279) {
    responseBody = responseBody.substring(1);
  }

  List data = json.decode(responseBody);
}
```

This code checks if the first character of the response body is the BOM (which is represented by the Unicode code point 65279), and if it is, it removes it before parsing the JSON.
