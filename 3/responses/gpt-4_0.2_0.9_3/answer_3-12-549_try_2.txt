In Dart, when you assign one list to another like `mylist = mynewlist;`, you're not creating a new list, you're just creating a new reference to the existing list. So when you clear `mylist`, it also clears `mynewlist` because they're pointing to the same list.

To create a new list with the same elements, you need to create a new list and add all elements from the existing list. You can do this with the `List.from()` constructor:

```dart
mylist = List.from(mynewlist);
```

This will create a new list with all elements from `mynewlist`, so when you clear `mylist`, it won't affect `mynewlist`.

Here's how you can modify your third button's `onPressed` function:

```dart
onPressed: () {
  setState(() {
    print('clicked 3rd');
    print(mylist.length);
    print(mynewlist.length);
    mylist = List.from(mynewlist);
  });
},
```
