The issue you're facing might be due to the version of the Android Studio or Flutter plugin you're using. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure you are using the latest stable version of Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Help -> Check for Updates...` in Android Studio.

2. **Update Flutter and Dart Plugins**: Ensure that your Flutter and Dart plugins are up-to-date. You can check this by going to `File -> Settings -> Plugins` in Android Studio.

3. **Update Flutter SDK**: Make sure your Flutter SDK is up-to-date. You can update Flutter SDK by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal.

4. **Reinstall Emulator**: Try to delete and reinstall the Android Emulator. You can do this by going to `Tools -> AVD Manager`, delete the current AVD and create a new one.

5. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, simply restarting Android Studio can solve the issue. 

If none of the above solutions work, it might be a bug with the Flutter plugin or Android Studio. In this case, you can report the issue to the Flutter team on their GitHub page.
