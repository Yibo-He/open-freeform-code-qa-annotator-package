The error message indicates that the Gradle build failed to produce an .aab file. This could be due to several reasons, including issues with the project configuration or the Gradle build script.

Here are a few things you could try to resolve this issue:

1. **Migrate to AndroidX**: The warning message indicates that your app isn't using AndroidX. AndroidX is a major improvement to the original Android Support Library and provides backward-compatibility for Android features. Some Flutter plugins may require AndroidX, so it's recommended to migrate your project to AndroidX. You can do this by following the steps provided in the warning message.

2. **Clean and Rebuild the Project**: Sometimes, cleaning the project and rebuilding it can resolve build issues. You can do this by running the following commands:

```bash
flutter clean
flutter build appbundle
```

3. **Check the Build Configuration**: Make sure that your `build.gradle` file is correctly configured. For example, check that the `minSdkVersion`, `targetSdkVersion`, and `compileSdkVersion` are set to appropriate values.

4. **Update Flutter and Dart SDKs**: Make sure that you're using the latest versions of the Flutter and Dart SDKs. You can update Flutter by running `flutter upgrade` and Dart by running `dart upgrade`.

5. **Check for Errors in Your Code**: Make sure that there are no errors in your Dart code that could be causing the build to fail.

If none of these solutions work, you may want to consider creating a new Flutter project and gradually moving your existing code into the new project to see if the issue persists. This can help you identify if the problem is with your project configuration or with your code.
