Yes, Dart's `Duration` class only supports time durations in terms of days, hours, minutes, seconds, and microseconds. For more complex date manipulations like adding or subtracting months or years, you can use the `DateTime` class along with the `intl` package.

Here's an example of how you can subtract 6 months from a date:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

void main() {
  DateTime now = DateTime.now();
  DateTime sixMonthsAgo = DateTime(now.year, now.month - 6, now.day);

  print(DateFormat('yyyy-MM-dd').format(sixMonthsAgo));
}
```

In this code, we're creating a new `DateTime` object with the current year and day, but with the month subtracted by 6. Note that Dart's `DateTime` constructor automatically adjusts the year if the month is less than 1 or greater than 12.

The `intl` package also provides a lot of other useful features for internationalization, like formatting dates, numbers, and strings.

If you want a more comprehensive date manipulation library similar to moment.js, you might want to check out the `date_utils` package. It provides a lot of additional functionality for working with dates in Dart.
