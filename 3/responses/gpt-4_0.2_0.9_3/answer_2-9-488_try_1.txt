The error message you're seeing is related to the YAML parser in Ruby (Psych) encountering an alias (default) that it doesn't recognize. This is usually due to a malformed YAML file in your application.

The error stack trace indicates that the error is occurring when webpacker is trying to load its environment configuration. This suggests that the issue might be in one of your webpacker configuration files, possibly `config/webpacker.yml`.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check your `config/webpacker.yml` file for any syntax errors or unexpected aliases. You can use an online YAML validator to help with this.

2. Try to temporarily remove the `config/webpacker.yml` file (or rename it) and see if the error persists. If the error disappears, it's a strong indication that this file is the source of the problem.

3. If the error persists, try to search for YAML files in your project and check them for syntax errors. You can use the `find` command in your terminal to do this:

   ```bash
   find . -name '*.yml'
   ```

4. If none of the above steps help, the issue might be in one of your gems. Try to update your gems one by one to see if the error disappears. Start with webpacker since the error seems to originate from it.

5. If the error still persists, try to create a new Rails application with the same Ruby and Rails versions and see if you can reproduce the error. If you can't, the issue is likely in your application's code or configuration. If you can, the issue might be in Rails or one of its dependencies, and you should consider reporting it.
