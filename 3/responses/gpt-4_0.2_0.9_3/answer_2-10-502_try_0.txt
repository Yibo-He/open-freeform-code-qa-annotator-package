The error message you're seeing indicates that the linker can't find the `libpq.lib` file, which is a part of the PostgreSQL library. 

Even though you have the `lib` and `bin` directories on your `PATH`, the Rust build system might not be able to find them. 

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the location of `libpq.lib`**: Make sure that the `libpq.lib` file is indeed in the `lib` directory of your PostgreSQL installation. If it's not, you might need to install it or move it to the correct location.

2. **Set the `LIB` and `INCLUDE` environment variables**: The Rust build system uses the `LIB` and `INCLUDE` environment variables to find libraries and headers. You should set these variables to point to the `lib` and `include` directories of your PostgreSQL installation. For example:

    ```
    set LIB=C:\pgsql\lib;%LIB%
    set INCLUDE=C:\pgsql\include;%INCLUDE%
    ```

    You can add these lines to your shell startup script to set these variables automatically every time you open a new shell.

3. **Install the `vcpkg` package manager**: If you're on Windows, you might find it easier to manage your C/C++ libraries with the `vcpkg` package manager. You can install `vcpkg` and then use it to install the `libpq` library:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
    cd vcpkg
    .\bootstrap-vcpkg.bat
    .\vcpkg integrate install
    .\vcpkg install libpq:x64-windows
    ```

    Then, you can set the `VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC` environment variable to tell the Rust build system to use `vcpkg`:

    ```
    set VCPKGRS_DYNAMIC=1
    ```

4. **Re-run the `cargo install` command**: After setting up everything, you should be able to install `diesel_cli` with the same command:

    ```
    cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
    ```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
