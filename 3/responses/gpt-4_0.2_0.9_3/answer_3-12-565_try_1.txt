To open WhatsApp from your Flutter app, you can use the `url_launcher` package. This package allows you to open URLs in the mobile platform. It supports both Android and iOS.

First, you need to add `url_launcher` to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  url_launcher: ^6.0.12  # Add this line
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

Now, you can use `url_launcher` to open WhatsApp. Here's a simple example:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

void main() {
  runApp(MyApp());
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('Launch WhatsApp'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: ElevatedButton(
            onPressed: _launchWhatsApp,
            child: Text('Open WhatsApp'),
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }

  _launchWhatsApp() async {
    var whatsappUrl = "whatsapp://send?phone=+1234567890&text=Hello"; // change the phone number
    if (await canLaunch(whatsappUrl)) {
      await launch(whatsappUrl);
    } else {
      throw 'Could not launch $whatsappUrl';
    }
  }
}
```

In this example, when you press the button, it will try to open WhatsApp and send a message to the phone number `+1234567890`. You should replace this with the actual phone number you want to send a message to.

Please note that this will only work on a device that has WhatsApp installed. If WhatsApp is not installed, it will throw an exception.

Also, note that the `canLaunch` function does not guarantee that the URL can be launched. It only checks if there is an app that can handle the URL scheme.
