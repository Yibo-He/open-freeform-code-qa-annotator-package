The AppBar widget in Flutter is quite flexible and can be customized to a great extent. However, to achieve the layout you want, you might need to create a custom AppBar. Here's a sample code snippet that might help you:

```dart
appBar: PreferredSize(
  preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(60.0), // here the desired height
  child: AppBar(
    backgroundColor: Colors.white,
    elevation: 0,
    leading: IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.menu, color: Colors.black),
      onPressed: () {
        // handle your drawer here
      },
    ),
    title: Text(
      'Title',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
    ),
    actions: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search, color: Colors.black),
        onPressed: () {
          // handle your actions here
        },
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.notifications, color: Colors.black),
        onPressed: () {
          // handle your actions here
        },
      ),
    ],
    bottom: PreferredSize(
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.grey,
        height: 1.0,
      ),
      preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(1.0),
    ),
  ),
),
```

In this code, I have used the `PreferredSize` widget to set a custom height for the AppBar. The `leading` property is used to set the drawer icon, the `title` property is used to set the title, and the `actions` property is used to set the action icons. The `bottom` property is used to set a grey line at the bottom of the AppBar.

Please replace the `Colors.white`, `Colors.black`, and `Colors.grey` with your custom colors. Also, handle the drawer and actions in the `onPressed` methods of the respective `IconButton` widgets.
