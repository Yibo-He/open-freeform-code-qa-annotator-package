It seems like the error is related to the libffi library. You can try installing the libffi-dev package using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi-dev
```

This should install the required library and resolve the issue. If the issue persists, you can try reinstalling the ffi gem using the following command:

```
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This should reinstall the ffi gem and link it to the newly installed libffi library.
