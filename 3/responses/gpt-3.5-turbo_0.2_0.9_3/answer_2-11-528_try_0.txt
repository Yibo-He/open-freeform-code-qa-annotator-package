You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false`. 

To do this, create a `.clang-format` file in the root directory of your project (if you don't already have one) and add the following line to it:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes in `clang-format`. 

Note that this will also disable any grouping of includes that you may have specified using the `includeCategories` option. If you want to keep the grouping but disable the sorting, you can set the `SortIncludes` option to `false` and specify your include categories as follows:

```
SortIncludes: false
IncludeCategories:
  - Regex: '^<.*\.h>'
    Priority: 1
  - Regex: '^<.*\.hpp>'
    Priority: 2
  - Regex: '^<.*>'
    Priority: 3
  - Regex: '^".*"'
    Priority: 4
```

This will group system includes (`<...>`) before local includes (`"..."`), but will not sort them within each group.
