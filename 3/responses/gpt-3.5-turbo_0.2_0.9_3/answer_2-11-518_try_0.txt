You are correct that in many cases, smart pointers can be used to manage resources and eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors. However, there are still some cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if you need to manage multiple resources or have complex ownership semantics, smart pointers may not be sufficient. In these cases, you may need to write your own resource management class with user-defined constructors and destructors.

Additionally, there may be cases where you want to customize the behavior of the copy or move constructors/assignment operators. For example, you may want to implement a deep copy instead of a shallow copy, or you may want to transfer ownership of resources in a specific way. In these cases, you would need to write your own copy/move constructors/assignment operators.

Overall, while smart pointers can eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors in many cases, there are still situations where they are necessary for more complex resource management or customization of behavior.
