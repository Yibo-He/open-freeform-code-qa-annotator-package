`MaterialStateProperty` is a type of property in `ButtonStyle` that allows you to define different values for a button's style based on its current state. For example, you can define a different background color for a button when it is pressed or disabled. 

In the code snippet you provided, `backgroundColor` is a `MaterialStateProperty<Color>` that defines the background color of a `TextButton`. You can set different colors for different states of the button by using the `resolve` method of the `MaterialStateProperty` class. For example, to set a different color for when the button is pressed, you can use the following code:

```
backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith((states) {
  if (states.contains(MaterialState.pressed)) {
    return Colors.red;
  }
  return Colors.blue;
}),
``` 

This will set the background color to red when the button is pressed, and blue for all other states.
