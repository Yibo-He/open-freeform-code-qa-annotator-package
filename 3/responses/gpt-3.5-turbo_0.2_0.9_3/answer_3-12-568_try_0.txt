There are a few options you can consider for running a background service in your Flutter app:

1. Use the `flutter_background` plugin: This plugin provides a simple way to run a background service in your Flutter app. It supports both Android and iOS platforms and allows you to run your service even when the app is closed or the device is restarted.

2. Use the `flutter_isolate` plugin: This plugin allows you to run Dart code in a separate isolate (a lightweight thread) in your app. You can use this to run your background service and communicate with it from your main isolate using message passing.

3. Use native code: If you're comfortable with native development, you can write a background service using the native APIs for Android and iOS. This will give you more control over the behavior of your service, but will require more work to integrate with your Flutter app.

In terms of simplicity, the `flutter_background` plugin is probably the easiest to use, as it provides a high-level API for running a background service. However, if you need more control over the behavior of your service, you may want to consider using the `flutter_isolate` plugin or writing native code.
