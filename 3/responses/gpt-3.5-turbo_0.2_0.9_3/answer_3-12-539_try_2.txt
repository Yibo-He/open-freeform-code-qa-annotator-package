It seems like the `path_provider` plugin is not properly installed or linked in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file and ran `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Check if you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file where you are using it. You can add the following import statement at the top of your file:

   ```
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
   ```

3. Try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` to reinstall all the dependencies.

4. If the above steps don't work, try running `flutter doctor` to check if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. You can also try running the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue persists.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try removing the `path_provider` dependency from your `pubspec.yaml` file and then adding it again. This will force Flutter to reinstall the plugin and link it properly.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
