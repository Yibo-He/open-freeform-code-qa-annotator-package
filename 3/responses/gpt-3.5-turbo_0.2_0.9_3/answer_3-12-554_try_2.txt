This error message suggests that you are trying to use a variable or object that is null, but the code expects it to be of type 'SkDeletable'. This could be caused by a number of things, such as a null value being passed to a function that expects a non-null value, or a variable not being initialized properly.

To fix this issue, you should check the code where the error is occurring and make sure that any variables or objects that are being used are properly initialized and not null. You can also use null safety features introduced in Flutter 2.0 to avoid null errors. You can use the null-aware operator (?.) to safely access properties or methods of an object that might be null.
