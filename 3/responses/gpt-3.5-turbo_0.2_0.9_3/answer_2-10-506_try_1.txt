You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to get the minimum value. Here's an example:

```
let v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min_value = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
println!("The minimum value is {}", min_value);
```

In this example, `v.iter()` creates an iterator over the vector, and `min()` returns an `Option<&i32>` containing the minimum value. We then use the `unwrap()` method to get the `i32` value itself, and the `*` operator to dereference the resulting reference.

This will output:

```
The minimum value is 2
```
