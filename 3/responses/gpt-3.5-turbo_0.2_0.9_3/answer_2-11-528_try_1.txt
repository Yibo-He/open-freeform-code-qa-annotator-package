To completely disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format`, you can set the `SortIncludes` option to `false`. This will prevent `clang-format` from reordering your includes.

You can add this option to your `.clang-format` file by adding the following line:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

If you don't have a `.clang-format` file yet, you can create one in the root directory of your project and add this line to it. 

Note that disabling the sorting of includes can lead to potential issues with third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's recommended to follow the recommended include order whenever possible.
