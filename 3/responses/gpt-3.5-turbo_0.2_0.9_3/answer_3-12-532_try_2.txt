The error message indicates that there is an unexpected character at the beginning of the JSON string. This character is likely a byte order mark (BOM) that is added by the PHP file. 

To fix this issue, you can try removing the BOM from the PHP file. You can do this by saving the file with UTF-8 encoding without BOM. 

Alternatively, you can modify your Dart code to handle the BOM. You can use the `utf8.decode` function from the `dart:convert` library to remove the BOM before decoding the JSON string. Here's an example:

```
import 'dart:convert';

// ...

var response = await http.post(
    url,
    headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
    body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
    encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
);

var jsonStr = utf8.decode(response.bodyBytes);
if (jsonStr.startsWith('\uFEFF')) {
  jsonStr = jsonStr.substring(1);
}

List data = json.decode(jsonStr);
``` 

This code uses the `utf8.decode` function to convert the response body bytes to a string, and then checks if the string starts with the BOM character (`\uFEFF`). If it does, the code removes the first character before decoding the JSON string.
