It seems like there is an issue with the `kramdown` gem, which is a dependency of Jekyll. The error message suggests that it cannot load the `rexml/parsers/baseparser` file. 

One solution you can try is to uninstall and reinstall the `kramdown` gem. You can do this by running the following commands:

```
gem uninstall kramdown
gem install kramdown
```

If that doesn't work, you can try updating all the gems in your project by running `bundle update`. This will update all the gems in your Gemfile to their latest versions.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try deleting your `Gemfile.lock` file and running `bundle install` again. This will regenerate the `Gemfile.lock` file with the latest versions of all the gems.

If you're still having issues, you can try creating a new Jekyll project and copying over your files to see if that resolves the issue.
