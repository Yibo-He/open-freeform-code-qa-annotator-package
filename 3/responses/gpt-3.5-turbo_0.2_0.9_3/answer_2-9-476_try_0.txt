It looks like the rbenv command is not being recognized by your shell. This could be because the rbenv executable is not in your PATH environment variable. 

To fix this, you can try adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc file:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
```

This will add the rbenv executable to your PATH so that it can be found by your shell.

After adding this line, save the file and then run the following command to reload your shell configuration:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

This should fix the issue and allow you to use rbenv without any errors.
