There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed. You can check for updates by going to "Help" > "Check for Updates".

2. Try creating a new AVD and see if it launches in the tool window. To create a new AVD, go to "Tools" > "AVD Manager" and click on the "Create Virtual Device" button.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the Flutter plugin. You can do this by going to "File" > "Settings" > "Plugins" and searching for "Flutter". If there is an update available, click on the "Update" button.

4. Try running the AVD from the command line using the "flutter emulators" command. To do this, open a terminal window and type "flutter emulators" to see a list of available emulators. Then, type "flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>" to launch the emulator in the tool window.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try resetting Android Studio to its default settings. To do this, go to "File" > "Manage IDE Settings" > "Restore Default Settings". This will reset all settings to their default values, so make sure to back up any important settings before doing this.
