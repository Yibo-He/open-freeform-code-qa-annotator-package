There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio installed.

2. Try deleting your existing AVD and creating a new one. To do this, go to "AVD Manager" and click on the "Delete" button next to your existing AVD. Then, click on the "Create Virtual Device" button and follow the steps to create a new AVD.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the Flutter and Dart plugins. To do this, go to "Settings" > "Plugins" and search for "Flutter" and "Dart". If there are updates available, click on the "Update" button to install them.

4. Try running the AVD from the command line using the "flutter emulators" command. To do this, open a terminal window and type "flutter emulators" to see a list of available emulators. Then, type "flutter emulators --launch <emulator_id>" to launch the emulator in a tool window.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will work for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
