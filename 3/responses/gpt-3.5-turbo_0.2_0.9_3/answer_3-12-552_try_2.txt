To achieve the desired layout, you can use a `Row` widget as the `title` of the `AppBar` and place the drawer icon and actions inside it. Here's an example code snippet:

```
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open drawer
        },
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
      ),
      Row(
        children: <Widget>[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            onPressed: () {
              // Perform search
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
            onPressed: () {
              // Show notifications
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

In this code, `mainAxisAlignment` is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to evenly distribute the drawer icon and actions on either side of the title. You can customize the icons and actions as per your requirements.
