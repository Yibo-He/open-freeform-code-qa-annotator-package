There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Restart Android Studio: Sometimes, simply restarting Android Studio can fix the issue.

2. Check your internet connection: Make sure that you have a stable internet connection. If your internet connection is slow or unstable, it may cause the installation process to fail.

3. Update Flutter and Dart plugins: Make sure that you have the latest version of the Flutter and Dart plugins installed in Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to File > Settings > Plugins.

4. Clear cache and restart: Try clearing the cache and restarting Android Studio. To do this, go to File > Invalidate Caches / Restart.

5. Check your firewall settings: Make sure that your firewall is not blocking the installation process. You may need to add an exception for Android Studio in your firewall settings.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to uninstall and reinstall Android Studio.
