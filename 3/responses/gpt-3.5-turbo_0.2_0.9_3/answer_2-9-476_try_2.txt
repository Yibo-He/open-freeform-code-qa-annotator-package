It seems like the rbenv command is not being recognized by zsh. This could be because the rbenv executable is not in the PATH environment variable. 

To fix this, try adding the following line to your ~/.zshrc file:

```
export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"
```

This will add the rbenv executable to the PATH variable so that zsh can find it. 

After adding this line, save the file and then run the following command to reload your zsh configuration:

```
source ~/.zshrc
```

This should resolve the issue and prevent the "command not found" error message from appearing in the future.
