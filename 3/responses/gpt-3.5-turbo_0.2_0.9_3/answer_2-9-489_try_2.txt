It's not recommended to ignore this message as it's a security warning. However, if you're just using Elasticsearch for development purposes, you can disable security features by adding the following line to your `config/elasticsearch.yml` file:

```
searchkick:
  es_client: Elasticsearch::Client.new(url: ENV['ELASTICSEARCH_URL'], transport_options: {request: {timeout: 250}})
  indices: [MyModel]
  disable_request_logging: false
  # Add the following line to disable security features
  insecure: true
```

This will disable security features and remove the warning message. However, please note that this is not recommended for production environments.

If you want to enable security features, you can try installing Elasticsearch with the `--with-basic-authentication` option:

```
brew install elasticsearch-full --with-basic-authentication
```

This should enable security features and allow you to run the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility. If you still can't find the script, you can try running `find / -name elasticsearch-setup-passwords` to search for it.

Alternatively, you can try installing Elasticsearch manually from the Elasticsearch website and follow the instructions to enable security features.
