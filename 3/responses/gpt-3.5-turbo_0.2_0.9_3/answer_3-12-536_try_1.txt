You can achieve this by using the `side` property of the `RoundedRectangleBorder` to set the color and width of the border. Here's an example:

```
new FlatButton(
  child: new Text("Button text"),
  onPressed: null,
  shape: new RoundedRectangleBorder(
    borderRadius: new BorderRadius.circular(30.0),
    side: BorderSide(color: Colors.blue, width: 2.0),
  ),
)
```

In this example, the `side` property is set to a blue color with a width of 2.0. You can adjust the color and width to your liking.
