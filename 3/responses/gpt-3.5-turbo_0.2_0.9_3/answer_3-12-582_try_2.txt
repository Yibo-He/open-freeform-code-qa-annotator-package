Yes, both pairs of code are functionally equivalent. 

The reason you are getting an error when using `context.read<Model>()` inside the `build()` method is because `read` is intended to be used outside of the `build()` method. 

`read` is a method of the `BuildContext` class that allows you to retrieve a value from a provider without triggering a rebuild of the widget tree. It is intended to be used in situations where you need to access a value from a provider outside of the `build()` method, such as in response to a user interaction or a network event.

On the other hand, `Provider.of<Model>(context)` and `context.watch<Model>()` both retrieve a value from a provider and register the widget as a dependent of that provider. This means that if the value of the provider changes, the widget will be rebuilt. These methods should be used inside the `build()` method to ensure that the widget is rebuilt when the value of the provider changes.
