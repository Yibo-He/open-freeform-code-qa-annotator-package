The error message suggests that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a new package structure for Android that replaces the old support libraries. To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio.
2. Click on Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX from the top menu.
3. Click on Do Refactor and wait for the process to complete.

After the migration is complete, try running the `flutter build appbundle` command again. If you still encounter issues, try running the command with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed error messages.
