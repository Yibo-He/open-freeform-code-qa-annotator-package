The `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute is used to suppress the "unused variable" warning that the Rust compiler generates when a variable is declared but not used. However, in your example, the variable `x` is not actually dead code, as it is being used to assign the value `0`. 

If you want to test the `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute, you can try declaring a variable that is not used anywhere in the code, like this:

```
fn main() {
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    let x = 0;
    let y = 1;
}
```

In this case, the `y` variable is not used anywhere in the code, so the Rust compiler will generate a "unused variable" warning. Adding the `#[allow(dead_code)]` attribute before the `y` variable declaration will suppress this warning.
