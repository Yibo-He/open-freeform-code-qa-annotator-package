It looks like you're on the right track with creating the `.d.ts` file and including it in `tsconfig.json`. However, you also need to tell Parcel how to handle image imports.

You can do this by installing the `parcel-plugin-static-files-copy` package and adding a `.parcelrc` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```
{
  "extends": "@parcel/config-default",
  "plugins": {
    "parcel-plugin-static-files-copy": {
      "staticPath": "src/assets"
    }
  }
}
```

This tells Parcel to copy the files in the `src/assets` directory to the output directory when building the project.

Then, in your component, you can import the image like this:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  return <img src={image} alt="My Image" />;
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to use the `* as` syntax when importing the image. Also, make sure to use the `src` attribute to display the image in your component.

With these changes, TypeScript should no longer complain about the missing module.
