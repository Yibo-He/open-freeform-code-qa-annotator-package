The error message suggests that the problem is related to the stack trace. Specifically, it seems that the stack trace contains a line that is not recognized by Flutter, which causes the error.

One possible cause of this problem is that the stack trace is being generated by a third-party library that is not compatible with Flutter. To fix this, you can try disabling the stack trace generation for that library by setting the `demangleStackTrace` property of `FlutterError` to `true`. Here's an example:

```
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart';

void main() {
  FlutterError.demangleStackTrace = true;
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

Another possible cause of this problem is that the stack trace is being generated by a bug in Flutter itself. In this case, you may need to update to a newer version of Flutter that includes a fix for the bug.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try disabling the stack trace altogether by setting the `debugPrintStackTraces` property of `WidgetsFlutterBinding` to `false`. This will prevent the stack trace from being printed to the console, but it may make it harder to diagnose other errors in your code. Here's an example:

```
import 'package:flutter/widgets.dart';

void main() {
  WidgetsFlutterBinding.debugPrintStackTraces = false;
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
