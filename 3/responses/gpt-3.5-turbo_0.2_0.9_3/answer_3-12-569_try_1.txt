Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter on `ChangeNotifierProvider` has been deprecated since version 4.0.0 and has been replaced with `create`. Here's how you can update your code to remove the warning:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

By using `create` instead of `builder`, you can remove the warning and continue to use `ChangeNotifierProvider` as before.
