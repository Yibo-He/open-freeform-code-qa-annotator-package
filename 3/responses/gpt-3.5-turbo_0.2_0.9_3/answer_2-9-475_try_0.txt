It seems like the issue is related to the missing `ruby/config.h` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install the Xcode command-line tools by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Install the `rbenv` package manager by running the following command:

   ```
   brew install rbenv
   ```

3. Install the Ruby version required by Travis by running the following command:

   ```
   rbenv install 2.3.1
   ```

4. Set the global Ruby version to 2.3.1 by running the following command:

   ```
   rbenv global 2.3.1
   ```

5. Install the `travis` gem by running the following command:

   ```
   gem install travis
   ```

6. Verify that the `travis` command is working by running the following command:

   ```
   travis version
   ```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
