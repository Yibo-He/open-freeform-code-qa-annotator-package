While it is possible to ignore this message, it is not recommended as it could potentially leave your Elasticsearch cluster vulnerable to unauthorized access. 

To fix this issue, you will need to enable security features in Elasticsearch. Here are the steps you can follow:

1. Install the Elasticsearch security plugin by running the following command:

```
bin/elasticsearch-plugin install -b https://d3g5vo6xdbdb9a.cloudfront.net/downloads/elasticsearch-plugins/security/security-7.13.1.zip
```

2. Add the following lines to your Elasticsearch configuration file (`/usr/local/etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`):

```
xpack.security.enabled: true
xpack.security.transport.ssl.enabled: true
```

3. Restart Elasticsearch:

```
brew services restart elasticsearch
```

4. Run the `elasticsearch-setup-passwords` utility to set up passwords for the built-in users:

```
bin/elasticsearch-setup-passwords auto
```

This should resolve the warning message and enable security features in Elasticsearch.
