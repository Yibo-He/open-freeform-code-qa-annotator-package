First, try running `flutter doctor --android-licenses` to accept the Android SDK licenses. If this does not work, try updating your Android SDK by following the instructions in the error message you received when running `flutter doctor`.

If updating your Android SDK does not solve the issue, try running `flutter clean` to clean the project and then run `flutter run` again.
