It seems like the error message is indicating that the `libffi.so.6` library is missing. You can try installing it by running the following command in your terminal:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

After installing the library, try running your Rails command again and see if the issue is resolved. If not, you may need to reinstall the `ffi` gem by running:

```
gem uninstall ffi
gem install ffi
```

This should rebuild the `ffi` gem with the newly installed `libffi.so.6` library.
