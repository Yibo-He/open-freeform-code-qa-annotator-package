This error message indicates that there is not enough storage space on the emulator to install the second app. You can try increasing the storage space of the emulator by creating a new emulator with more storage space or by increasing the storage space of the existing emulator.

To create a new emulator with more storage space, follow these steps:

1. Open Android Studio and go to the AVD Manager.
2. Click on "Create Virtual Device".
3. Select a device and click "Next".
4. Choose a system image and click "Next".
5. In the "Emulated Performance" section, increase the "Internal Storage" value.
6. Click "Finish" to create the new emulator.

To increase the storage space of an existing emulator, follow these steps:

1. Open Android Studio and go to the AVD Manager.
2. Click on the "Edit" button next to the emulator you want to modify.
3. In the "Advanced Settings" section, click on "Show Advanced Settings".
4. Increase the "Internal Storage" value.
5. Click "Finish" to save the changes.

If increasing the storage space does not solve the problem, you can try wiping the data of the emulator. This will delete all the data on the emulator, including the previously installed app, and free up space for the new app. To wipe the data of the emulator, follow these steps:

1. Open Android Studio and go to the AVD Manager.
2. Click on the "Wipe Data" button next to the emulator you want to wipe.
3. Click "OK" to confirm.

Note that wiping the data will delete all the data on the emulator, so make sure to back up any important data before doing this.
