The error message suggests that the `std::filesystem` namespace has not been declared. This is because the `std::filesystem` library was introduced in C++17 and may not be available in older versions of the C++ standard library.

To fix this issue, you need to add the `stdc++fs` library to your `target_link_libraries` command in your `CMakeLists.txt` file. This library provides the necessary support for the `std::filesystem` library.

Here is the updated `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)

project(visual_hull LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_library(dataIO
        STATIC
            dataIO.hpp
            dataIO.cpp)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)

target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS})

add_executable(visual_hull main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(visual_hull PUBLIC dataIO
                                         stdc++fs)
```

With this change, the `std::filesystem` library should be available in your code and the error should be resolved.
