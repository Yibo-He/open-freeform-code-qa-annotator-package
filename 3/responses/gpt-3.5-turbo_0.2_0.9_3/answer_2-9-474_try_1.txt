Based on the error message, it seems that there is a superclass mismatch for the `StringIO` class. This could be caused by a conflict between different versions of the `stringio` gem or a similar gem that defines the `StringIO` class.

One possible solution is to try updating the `stringio` gem to the latest version and see if that resolves the issue. You can do this by running `bundle update stringio` in your terminal.

If that doesn't work, you can try removing the `stringio` gem from your Gemfile and running `bundle install` to see if that resolves the issue. However, this may cause other dependencies to break, so proceed with caution.

It's also worth checking if there are any other gems in your Gemfile that define the `StringIO` class and ensuring that they are compatible with each other.
