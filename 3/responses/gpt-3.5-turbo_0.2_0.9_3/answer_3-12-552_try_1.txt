To achieve the desired layout, you can use a Row widget as the title of the AppBar. Here's an example code:

```
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open drawer
        },
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open search screen
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

In this code, we have used a Row widget as the title of the AppBar. The `mainAxisAlignment` property of the Row widget is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to evenly distribute the child widgets along the horizontal axis. 

The first child of the Row widget is an IconButton with the menu icon. The `onPressed` property of the IconButton can be used to open the drawer.

The second child of the Row widget is a Text widget with the title of the screen.

The third child of the Row widget is an IconButton with the search icon. The `onPressed` property of the IconButton can be used to open the search screen.

You can customize the icons and their actions as per your requirements.
