The issue with your code is that the threads you are creating are borrowing mutable references to the strings in the `strings` vector. However, the lifetime of these mutable references is tied to the lifetime of the `strings` vector, which is not `'static`. This means that the threads cannot outlive the `strings` vector, which is dropped at the end of the `main` function.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move the ownership of each string into the closure passed to `thread::spawn`. This way, each thread will own its own string and will not need to borrow it from the `strings` vector. Here's the modified code:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut s = s;
            child_job(&mut s);
            s
        }));
    }

    // wait for threads and collect results
    let results: Vec<_> = thread_handles.into_iter().map(|h| h.join().unwrap()).collect();

    // print result
    for s in results {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

In this version, we use `move` to move the ownership of each string into the closure passed to `thread::spawn`. We then create a mutable reference to the string inside the closure and pass it to `child_job`. Finally, we return the modified string from the closure and collect the results of all the threads into a new vector.
