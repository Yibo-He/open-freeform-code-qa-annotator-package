Yes, in Flutter you can draw vertical lines between components using the `Divider` widget. Here's an example:

```
Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Component 1'),
    Divider(),
    Text('Component 2'),
    Divider(),
    Text('Component 3'),
  ],
)
```

This will create a column of components with vertical lines between them. You can customize the appearance of the `Divider` widget by setting its color, thickness, and indent properties.
