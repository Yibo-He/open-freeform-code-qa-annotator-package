The error message suggests that the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method is returning null. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. The path_provider package is not properly installed or linked in your project. Try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to ensure that all dependencies are properly installed.

2. There might be an issue with the device or emulator you are running the app on. Try restarting the device or emulator and then running the app again.

3. There might be a permissions issue with the device or emulator. Make sure that the app has permission to access the device's storage by adding the following line to your AndroidManifest.xml file:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE"/>
```

4. There might be an issue with the version of the path_provider package you are using. Try updating to the latest version by running `flutter pub upgrade`.

If none of these solutions work, try using a different package to get the application documents directory, such as the `path_provider_ex` package.
