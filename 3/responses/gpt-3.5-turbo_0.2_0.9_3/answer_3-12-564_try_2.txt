The error message suggests that you are trying to reuse the same `AdWidget` instance in multiple places in the widget tree. To solve this, you need to create a new instance of `AdWidget` for each ad object.

One way to do this is to generate a unique key for each `AdWidget` instance using the `UniqueKey` widget. You can modify your code as follows:

```
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if (posts[index] is Post) {
      return posts[index];
    } else {
      final ad = posts[index] as BannerAd;
      return Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: ad),
        height: 50,
      );
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics()),
);
```

This should create a new `AdWidget` instance with a unique key for each ad object, and prevent the error you are seeing.
