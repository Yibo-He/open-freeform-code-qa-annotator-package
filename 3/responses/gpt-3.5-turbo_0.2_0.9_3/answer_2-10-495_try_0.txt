The issue with your code is that the threads you are creating are borrowing mutable references to the strings in the `strings` vector. However, the threads may outlive the vector, which would cause the references to become invalid. This is what the compiler is warning you about.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move ownership of the string into the thread closure. This way, the thread will own the string and there will be no lifetime issues. Here's the modified code:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s.clone())));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

In this code, we use `move` to move ownership of the string `s` into the thread closure. We also use `s.clone()` to create a new mutable reference to the string, which we pass to `child_job`. This way, each thread has its own copy of the string to work with, and there are no lifetime issues.

Note that we also removed the `&mut` from the `child_job` function signature, since we are now passing a mutable reference to the cloned string.
