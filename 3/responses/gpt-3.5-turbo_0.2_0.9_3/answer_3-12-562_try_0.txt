Yes, you are correct that the `Duration` class in Dart does not have built-in methods to add or subtract years or months. However, you can achieve this functionality using the `DateTime` class.

To subtract 6 months from a `DateTime` object, you can use the `subtract` method and pass in a `Duration` object representing 6 months. Here's an example:

```
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
DateTime sixMonthsAgo = date.subtract(Duration(days: 30 * 6));
```

This subtracts 6 months (approximately 30 days per month) from the current date and time.

As for a library similar to moment.js in Dart, you can use the `intl` package which provides a `DateFormat` class for formatting and parsing dates. However, it does not have the same level of functionality as moment.js.
