One way to simplify this code is to use the `map()` and `and_then()` methods on `Option`. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code using these methods:

```
let result = func1()
    .and_then(func2)
    .and_then(func3)
    .and_then(func4);

if let Some(result) = result {
    // Do something with result
} else {
    println!("One of the functions returned None");
}
```

This code is much shorter and easier to read than the original code. It uses the `and_then()` method to chain the functions together, and the `map()` method to extract the final result from the `Option` type. If any of the functions return `None`, the code will print an error message.

Note that you can also use the `?` operator to achieve a similar result, but you would need to define a custom error type that implements the `From` trait for each of the `Option` types. This can be more complex than using the `map()` and `and_then()` methods, so I would recommend sticking with the `map()` and `and_then()` approach unless you have a specific reason to use the `?` operator.
