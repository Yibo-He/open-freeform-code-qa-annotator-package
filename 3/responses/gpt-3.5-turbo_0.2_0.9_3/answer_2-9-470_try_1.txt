It looks like the error message is indicating that the `libffi.so.6` shared library file is missing. This library is required by the `ffi` gem, which is used by Rails and other Ruby libraries.

To fix this issue, you can try installing the `libffi6` package using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libffi6
```

If the package is already installed, you can try reinstalling it:

```
sudo apt-get install --reinstall libffi6
```

Once the package is installed or reinstalled, try running your Rails command again and see if the issue is resolved.
