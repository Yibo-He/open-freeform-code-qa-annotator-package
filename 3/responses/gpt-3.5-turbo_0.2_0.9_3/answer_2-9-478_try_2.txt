It seems like the issue is related to the version of Rails or ActiveSupport that you are using. Devise 4.8.0 requires ActiveSupport 5.0 or higher, so you may need to upgrade your Rails version or ActiveSupport version to meet this requirement.

You can try updating your Gemfile to include the latest version of Rails and ActiveSupport, and then run `bundle update` to install the latest versions of all your gems. Here's an example of what your Gemfile might look like:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

ruby '3.0.0'

gem 'rails', '~> 6.1.3'
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.0'
```

After updating your Gemfile, run `bundle update` to install the latest versions of your gems. Then try running your Rails application again and see if the issue is resolved.

If you are still having issues, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Devise:

```
gem uninstall devise
bundle install
```

This should install the latest version of Devise that is compatible with your version of Rails and ActiveSupport.
