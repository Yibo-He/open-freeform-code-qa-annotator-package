The error message suggests that the code needs to be executed within the context of a Tokio runtime, which provides a reactor for asynchronous I/O operations. 

To fix this, you can wrap the code inside a `tokio::runtime::Runtime` block, which will create a new runtime and execute the code within its context. Here's an updated version of the code:

```rust
use futures_util::{pin_mut, stream::StreamExt};
use mdns::{Error, Record, RecordKind};
use std::{net::IpAddr, time::Duration};

const SERVICE_NAME: &'static str = "_googlecast._tcp.local";

fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    let rt = tokio::runtime::Runtime::new()?;
    rt.block_on(async {
        // Iterate through responses from each Cast device, asking for new devices every 15s
        let stream = mdns::discover::all(SERVICE_NAME, Duration::from_secs(15))?.listen();
        pin_mut!(stream);

        while let Some(Ok(response)) = stream.next().await {
            let addr = response.records().filter_map(self::to_ip_addr).next();

            if let Some(addr) = addr {
                println!("found cast device at {}", addr);
            } else {
                println!("cast device does not advertise address");
            }
        }

        Ok(())
    })
}

fn to_ip_addr(record: &Record) -> Option<IpAddr> {
    match record.kind {
        RecordKind::A(addr) => Some(addr.into()),
        RecordKind::AAAA(addr) => Some(addr.into()),
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

This should create a new runtime and execute the code within its context, allowing the `mdns` library to use the Tokio reactor.
