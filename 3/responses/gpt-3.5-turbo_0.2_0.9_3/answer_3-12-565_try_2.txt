To launch WhatsApp in a Flutter `webview` app or from the browser in Flutter, you can use the `url_launcher` package. Here's how you can do it:

1. Add the `url_launcher` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```
dependencies:
  url_launcher: ^6.0.3
```

2. Import the `url_launcher` package in your code:

```
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';
```

3. Use the `launch` method to open the WhatsApp URL:

```
String url = "https://wa.me/whatsappphonenumber";
await launch(url);
```

Replace `whatsappphonenumber` with the phone number you want to send a message to, including the country code but without any spaces or special characters. For example, if the phone number is +1 555-123-4567, the URL should be `https://wa.me/15551234567`.

You can use this code in your `pageUI` method to launch WhatsApp when a button is pressed or when a certain condition is met. For example:

```
FlatButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    String url = "https://wa.me/whatsappphonenumber";
    await launch(url);
  },
  child: Text("Launch WhatsApp"),
),
```
