The error message suggests that there is an issue with the YAML parser in your application. It's possible that one of your gems is using YAML and causing this issue. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Gemfile.lock to see if any of your gems are using YAML. You can search for "yaml" in the file to find any relevant entries.

2. Try running `bundle exec rails s` to ensure that you are using the correct version of Rails and its dependencies.

3. Try removing any gems that you recently added or updated to see if that resolves the issue.

4. Check the documentation for any gems that you are using to see if they have any known issues with YAML or the version of Ruby that you are using.

5. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you may want to try rolling back to the previous version of Ruby that you were using and see if the issue persists.
