The error message you are seeing is not very specific, so it could be caused by a number of things. However, the error message you see when you run `flutter doctor` is likely related to the issue.

To fix the Android license status unknown error, you can try running the following command in your terminal:

```
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

This will prompt you to accept the Android SDK licenses, which you need to do in order to use the Android SDK with Flutter.

If that doesn't work, you can try updating your Android SDK Manager by following the instructions in the error message. Once you have updated your Android SDK Manager, run `flutter doctor` again to see if the error has been resolved.

If you are still experiencing issues, you can try running `flutter clean` to clean your project and then try running it again. If that doesn't work, you can try deleting the `build` folder in your project directory and then running the project again.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
