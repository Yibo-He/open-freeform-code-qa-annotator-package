One way to simplify the code is to use the `map_or_else` method on the `Option` type. This method takes two closures as arguments: the first one is called if the `Option` is `None`, and the second one is called with the inner value if the `Option` is `Some`. Here's an example:

```
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    foo = foo.map_or_else(|| Some(5), |val| if val < 5 { Some(5) } else { foo });
}
```

In this code, if `foo` is `None`, we replace it with `Some(5)`. If `foo` is `Some`, we check if the inner value is less than 5. If it is, we replace `foo` with `Some(5)`. If it's not, we leave `foo` unchanged.

This code is more concise than the original code and avoids the need for an arm that doesn't do anything.
