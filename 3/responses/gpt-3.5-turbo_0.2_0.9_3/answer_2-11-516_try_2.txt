Yes, it is correct to say that the keyword `new` as it is used in a new expression is an operator. In C++, an operator is a symbol or keyword that represents an operation to be performed on one or more operands. The `new` operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for an object and return a pointer to that object. 

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` operator is used in a new expression to allocate memory for an object. However, it is important to note that the `new` operator is not the same as the `operator new` function, which is used to allocate memory for an object but does not construct the object.

In summary, the `new` keyword as used in a new expression is an operator because it represents an operation to be performed on an operand (the size of the object to be allocated). The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` operator is used in a new expression to allocate memory for an object.
