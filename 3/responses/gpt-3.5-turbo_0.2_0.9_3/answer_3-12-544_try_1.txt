The error message suggests that the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method is returning null. This could happen if the path_provider package is not properly installed or if there is an issue with the device or emulator you are running the app on.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the path_provider package to your pubspec.yaml file and run `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Try running the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue persists.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the path_provider package and update it to the latest version.

4. Try using the `getApplicationSupportDirectory()` method instead of `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` to see if it works.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try resetting your flutter environment by running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` to reinstall all the packages.

I hope one of these solutions helps you fix the issue.
