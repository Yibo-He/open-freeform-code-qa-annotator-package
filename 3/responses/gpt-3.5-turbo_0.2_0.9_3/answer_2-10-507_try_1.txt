You can use the `futures::future::join_all` function to achieve this. It takes a vector of futures and returns a future that completes when all the input futures have completed. Here's how you can modify your code to use `join_all`:

```
use futures::future::join_all;

async fn start_consumers(&self) {
    let mut futures = Vec::new();
    for consumer in &self.consumers {
        futures.push(consumer.consume());
    }
    join_all(futures).await;
}
```

This will execute all the `consume` functions concurrently and wait for all of them to complete before returning.
