There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that your mobile device is connected to the same network as your computer. If they are not on the same network, the installation process may fail.

2. Check if your mobile device has enough storage space to install the app. If there is not enough space, the installation process may fail.

3. Try restarting both your computer and mobile device and then try running the command again.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try uninstalling the app from your mobile device and then try running the command again.

5. If the issue persists, try running the command with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed information about the installation process. This may help you identify the issue and find a solution.
