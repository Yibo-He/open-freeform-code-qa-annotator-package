It seems like there are a few issues going on here. Let's break them down:

1. `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::InvalidMessage` error when running `heroku run rails console`

This error is occurring because Heroku is unable to decrypt your encrypted credentials file. The error message suggests that the message being decrypted is invalid, which could be caused by a few things:

- The credentials file was encrypted with a different key than the one being used to decrypt it
- The credentials file was corrupted during deployment
- The credentials file was not deployed at all

To fix this issue, you should try the following:

- Make sure that your `master.key` file is present in your local environment and that it matches the one in your Heroku environment. You can check this by running `heroku config:get RAILS_MASTER_KEY` and comparing the output to the contents of your local `master.key` file.
- If your `master.key` file is present and correct, try re-encrypting your credentials file and re-deploying it to Heroku. You can do this by running `EDITOR=vim rails credentials:edit` in your local environment, making any necessary changes, and then running `rails credentials:show` to verify that the changes were saved. Then, add the updated `config/credentials.yml.enc` file to your Git repository and push the changes to Heroku.

2. `OpenSSL::Cipher::CipherError` error during asset precompilation on Heroku

This error is occurring because Heroku is unable to decrypt your encrypted credentials file during the asset precompilation process. This is likely related to the `ActiveSupport::MessageEncryptor::InvalidMessage` error you are seeing when running `heroku run rails console`.

To fix this issue, you should try the same steps as above to ensure that your `master.key` file and `config/credentials.yml.enc` file are both present and correct in your Heroku environment.

3. `Your Gemfile lists the gem pg (>= 0) more than once` warning during deployment

This warning is occurring because you have listed the `pg` gem twice in your Gemfile. You should remove one of the occurrences to avoid potential conflicts.

To fix this issue, simply remove one of the lines that includes `pg` in your Gemfile and re-deploy to Heroku.
