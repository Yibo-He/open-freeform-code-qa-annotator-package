To create a new line manually with a string variable, you can use the "\n" character in your string. For example, you can modify your code like this:

```
var text = "This is a long text that needs to be split into multiple lines. " +
           "We can use the \\n character to create a new line manually.";

return Container(
  child: Column(
    children: <Widget>[
      Text(
        "${text}",
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
        textAlign: TextAlign.center,
      ),
    ],
  ),
);
```

In this example, the "\n" character is used to split the long text into two lines. When the text is displayed, it will automatically create a new line at the position of the "\n" character. You can modify the text and add more "\n" characters to create more lines as needed.
