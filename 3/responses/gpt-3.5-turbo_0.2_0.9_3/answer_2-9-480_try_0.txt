The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `kramdown` gem, which is a dependency of Jekyll. Specifically, it seems to be missing the `rexml/parsers/baseparser` file.

One possible solution is to try uninstalling and reinstalling the `kramdown` gem:

```
gem uninstall kramdown
gem install kramdown
```

If that doesn't work, you can try adding the following line to your Gemfile:

```
gem 'rexml'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the missing dependency.

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to check your Ruby installation and make sure that all the necessary dependencies are installed.
