Based on the error message, it seems like the OpenSSL library is not installed on your system. You can try installing it using the following command:

```
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
```

Once the installation is complete, try running the command again:

```
ruby -r openssl -e 'puts OpenSSL::OPENSSL_VERSION'
```

If the command runs successfully, you should see the version of OpenSSL installed on your system.

Regarding the gem installation errors, it's hard to say without more information. Can you provide the error message you are seeing when running `gem list`?
