It seems like the issue is related to the missing `ruby/config.h` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install the Xcode command-line tools by running the following command in the terminal:
```
xcode-select --install
```

2. Install the `rbenv` package manager for Ruby by running the following command in the terminal:
```
brew install rbenv
```

3. Install the required version of Ruby by running the following command in the terminal:
```
rbenv install 2.3.0
```

4. Set the global version of Ruby to the installed version by running the following command in the terminal:
```
rbenv global 2.3.0
```

5. Install the `bundler` gem by running the following command in the terminal:
```
gem install bundler
```

6. Finally, install the `travis` gem by running the following command in the terminal:
```
gem install travis
```

These steps should resolve the issue and allow you to install the `travis` gem successfully.
