The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. You have specified version 5.6.2 in your project level build.gradle file, but it seems that this version is not available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

To fix this issue, you can try updating the version of the Android Gradle plugin to a more recent version that is available in the repositories. You can do this by changing the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

to:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

This will update the Android Gradle plugin to version 4.1.0, which is the latest stable version at the time of writing. You can also check for the latest version of the plugin on the official Android Gradle plugin release notes page.

After making this change, you should sync your project with Gradle by clicking on the "Sync Now" button in Android Studio or running the "gradlew clean build" command in the terminal. This should download the required version of the Android Gradle plugin and allow you to build and run your app on your device.
