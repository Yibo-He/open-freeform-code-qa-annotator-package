The error message suggests that there is an issue with the YAML parser in your application. It seems that the `Psych` library is unable to find an alias named `default`. This could be due to a problem with the YAML file that you are trying to load.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your YAML files: Look for any syntax errors or missing aliases in your YAML files. Make sure that all aliases are defined correctly and that there are no typos.

2. Check your Gemfile: Make sure that all the gems in your Gemfile are compatible with Ruby 3.1.1. You can check the compatibility of each gem by looking at its documentation or by checking its GitHub repository.

3. Update your gems: Try updating all the gems in your Gemfile to their latest versions. You can do this by running `bundle update`.

4. Reinstall your gems: If updating your gems doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling them. You can do this by running `bundle install` and `bundle clean`.

5. Check your Rails configuration: Make sure that your Rails configuration is set up correctly. Check your `config/application.rb` file and make sure that all the necessary configurations are present.

6. Check your environment variables: Make sure that all your environment variables are set up correctly. Check your `.env` file and make sure that all the necessary variables are present.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to seek help from the Ruby community or consider rolling back to the previous version of Ruby that was working for you.
