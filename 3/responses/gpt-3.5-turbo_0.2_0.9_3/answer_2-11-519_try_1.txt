The error message is indicating that the `<experimental/filesystem>` header is deprecated and will be removed in the future. Instead, you should use the `<filesystem>` header which provides the same functionality but is part of the C++17 standard.

To fix the error, you should replace the line `#include <experimental/filesystem>` with `#include <filesystem>`. Then, replace the line `namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;` with `namespace fs = std::filesystem;`.

If you still get the error after making these changes, you can define `_SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` before including any headers in your code. Make sure to define it before including any headers, otherwise it won't have any effect.
