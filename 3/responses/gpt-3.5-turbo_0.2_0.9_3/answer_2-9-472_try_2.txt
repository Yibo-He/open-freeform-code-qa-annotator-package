It seems like the error is related to the `node-sass` package. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the `std::remove_cv_t` function in the `v8-internal.h` header file. This could be caused by a version incompatibility between the `node-sass` package and the version of Node.js that you are using.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Update the version of `node-sass` to the latest version that is compatible with your version of Node.js. You can check the compatibility matrix on the `node-sass` GitHub page to find the right version.

2. Try downgrading the version of Node.js to a version that is compatible with the `node-sass` package you are using.

3. Remove the `node-sass` package from your dependencies and use a different package for compiling Sass files, such as `sass` or `postcss-sass`.

4. If you are using Yarn, try clearing the cache and reinstalling the dependencies:

```
yarn cache clean
yarn install
```

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try deleting the `node_modules` folder and reinstalling all the dependencies:

```
rm -rf node_modules
yarn install
```

I hope this helps you resolve the issue. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
