The warning is still present because the analyzer cannot guarantee that the value associated with the key `1` is not `null`. Even though you are checking if the map contains the key `1`, another thread or function could have removed the key-value pair between the `containsKey` check and the actual retrieval of the value. 

To fix the warning, you can either use a null-aware operator like `myMap[1] ?? defaultValue` to provide a default value in case the value is `null`, or you can use a non-null assertion operator like `myMap[1]!` to assert that the value is not `null`. However, be careful when using the non-null assertion operator as it can lead to runtime errors if the value is actually `null`.
