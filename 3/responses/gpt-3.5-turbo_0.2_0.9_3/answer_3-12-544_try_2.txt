The error message suggests that the `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` method is returning a null value. This could be due to a number of reasons, such as a missing permission or a problem with the device.

Here are some steps you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make sure you have added the necessary permissions in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file. You need to add the following lines:

```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

2. Try running the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue persists.

3. Check if the `path_provider` package is properly installed and up-to-date. You can do this by running `flutter pub outdated` in the terminal.

4. Try using the `getExternalStorageDirectory()` method instead of `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory()` to see if it works. This method returns the external storage directory of the device.

If none of these steps work, you can try using a different package to get the application directory, such as `flutter_file_manager`.
