You can disable the ordering of includes in `clang-format` by setting the `SortIncludes` option to `false`. This will prevent `clang-format` from reordering your includes.

To do this, you can create a `.clang-format` file in the root directory of your project (if you don't already have one) and add the following line to it:

```
SortIncludes: false
```

This will disable the sorting of includes for all files in your project. If you want to enable sorting for specific files, you can override this setting by adding a `// clang-format off` comment at the beginning of the file and a `// clang-format on` comment at the end of the file.

Note that disabling the sorting of includes may cause issues with some third-party libraries that require a specific include order. It's generally recommended to follow the recommended include order for each library to avoid potential issues.
