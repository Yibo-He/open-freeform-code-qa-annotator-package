This error occurs when the Sprockets manifest file is missing or not up-to-date. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Run `rails assets:precompile` to regenerate the manifest file.
2. If the above step does not work, try deleting the `public/assets` directory and running `rails assets:precompile` again.
3. If the issue persists, try running `bundle exec rake assets:clean` to remove any old assets and then run `rails assets:precompile` again.

If none of the above steps work, you may need to investigate further to see if there are any other issues with your application's asset pipeline configuration.
