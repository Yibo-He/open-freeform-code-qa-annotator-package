This error message usually occurs when you are trying to use a variable or object that has not been initialized or is null. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if you have declared and initialized all the variables and objects that you are using in your code.

2. Make sure that you are not passing null values to any function or method.

3. Check if you are using any deprecated or outdated packages in your project. If yes, update them to the latest version.

4. Try to run your code with the --no-sound-null-safety flag to see if it resolves the issue. 

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try to debug your code and see where the null value is coming from.

I hope this helps you to resolve the issue.
