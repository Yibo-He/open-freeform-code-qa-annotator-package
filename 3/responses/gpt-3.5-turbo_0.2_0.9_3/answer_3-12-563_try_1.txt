To create a new line manually with a string variable, you can use the "\n" character in your string. For example, if you want to create a new line after the first sentence in your `text[0]` variable, you can modify it like this:

```
List text = [
  "${quranText['sura'][widget.surahDipilih]['aya'][index]['_text']}\n",
  quranTranslation[widget.surahDipilih]['aya'][index]['@text']
];
```

This will add a new line after the first sentence in your `AutoSizeText` widget. You can adjust the position of the new line by adding more "\n" characters as needed.
