To ensure that the child class implements the super constructor, you can add the `@required` annotation to the constructor in the `BaseClass` and also add the `super` keyword to the child class constructor. This will ensure that the child class constructor calls the super constructor of the parent class. 

Here's an example:

```
abstract class BaseClass {
  final String name;

  BaseClass({
    @required this.name,
  });
}

class ChildClass extends BaseClass {
  ChildClass({@required String name}) : super(name: name);
}
```

In this example, the `@required` annotation in the `BaseClass` constructor ensures that the `name` parameter is required. The `super(name: name)` call in the `ChildClass` constructor ensures that the super constructor of the `BaseClass` is called with the required `name` parameter. 

By doing this, the IDE will inform you if you forget to implement the super constructor in the child class.
