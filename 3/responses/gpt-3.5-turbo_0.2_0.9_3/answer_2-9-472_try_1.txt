The error message indicates that there is a problem with the `node-sass` package during the build process. This could be due to a version incompatibility issue with the current version of Node.js (v16.13.1) that you have specified in the `engines` section of your `package.json` file.

To fix this issue, you can try downgrading the Node.js version to a lower version that is compatible with the `node-sass` package. You can do this by updating the `engines` section of your `package.json` file to specify a lower version of Node.js, for example:

```
"engines": {
  "node": "14.x"
}
```

After updating the `engines` section, run `yarn install` again to install the dependencies with the updated Node.js version. Then try deploying your app to Heroku again.

If downgrading the Node.js version does not work, you can try updating the `node-sass` package to a newer version that is compatible with the current version of Node.js. You can do this by updating the `node-sass` package version in your `package.json` file, for example:

```
"node-sass": "^7.0.0"
```

After updating the `node-sass` package version, run `yarn install` again to install the updated package. Then try deploying your app to Heroku again.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try removing the `node-sass` package from your project and using an alternative package for Sass compilation, such as `sass` or `dart-sass`. You can update your `package.json` file to include the alternative package, for example:

```
"sass": "^1.43.4"
```

After updating the `package.json` file, run `yarn install` again to install the alternative package. Then update your Sass configuration to use the new package instead of `node-sass`. Finally, try deploying your app to Heroku again.
