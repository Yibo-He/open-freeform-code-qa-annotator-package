To sort a vector of structs by multiple keys, you can use the `sort_by()` method and provide a closure that compares the two items based on the keys you want to sort by.

Here's an example implementation for your `MyStruct` struct:

```
my_vector.sort_by(|a, b| {
    if a.row == b.row {
        a.column.cmp(&b.column)
    } else {
        a.row.cmp(&b.row)
    }
});
```

This closure first compares the `row` field of the two items. If they are equal, it compares the `column` field. This will result in a vector sorted by `row` first, and then by `column`.

You can modify this closure to sort by more fields if needed. Just add more `if` statements to compare additional fields.
