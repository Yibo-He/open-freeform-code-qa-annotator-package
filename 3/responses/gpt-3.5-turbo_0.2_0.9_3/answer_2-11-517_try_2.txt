In C++, you can use the `std::stringstream` class to achieve string interpolation. Here's an example:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <sstream>

int main() {
    int myVariable = 42;
    std::stringstream ss;
    ss << "My variable has value " << myVariable;
    std::string result = ss.str();
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, we first create an instance of `std::stringstream`. We then use the `<<` operator to insert the string literal and the value of `myVariable` into the stream. Finally, we call the `str()` method to get the resulting string.

This approach is a bit more verbose than the string interpolation syntax in C# and JavaScript, but it's still a common way of achieving the same result in C++.
