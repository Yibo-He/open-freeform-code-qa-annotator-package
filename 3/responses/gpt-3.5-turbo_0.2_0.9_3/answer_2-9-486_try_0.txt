It sounds like the issue is that the `application.js` file is not being compiled and copied to the `public/assets` folder during the asset precompilation step on Heroku. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your `config/environments/production.rb` file to make sure that the `config.assets.compile` setting is set to `true`. This will ensure that all assets are compiled, even if they are not explicitly included in the asset pipeline.

2. Try running the asset precompilation step locally with the `RAILS_ENV=production bundle exec rake assets:precompile` command and see if the `application.js` file is generated and copied to the `public/assets` folder. If it is, then the issue may be with the Heroku deployment process.

3. Check your Heroku build logs to see if there are any errors or warnings related to the asset precompilation step. You can view the logs by running the `heroku logs --tail` command.

4. Try adding the `app/assets/builds` folder to your Git repository and pushing it to Heroku. This will ensure that the `application.js` file is present in the `public/assets` folder during the asset precompilation step.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you may need to contact Heroku support for further assistance.
