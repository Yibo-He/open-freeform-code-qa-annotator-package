This error occurs when the Sprockets manifest file is missing or not up-to-date. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Run `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` to generate the manifest file.
2. If the above step doesn't work, try deleting the `public/assets` directory and running `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` again.
3. If the issue persists, try running `bundle exec rake assets:clobber` to remove all compiled assets and then run `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` again.

If none of the above steps work, you may need to investigate further to determine the root cause of the issue.
