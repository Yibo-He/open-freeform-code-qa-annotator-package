The error message suggests that the problem is related to the stack trace. Specifically, it seems that the stack trace is not in the expected format, which can happen if `FlutterError.demangleStackTrace` is not set in the environment.

To fix this issue, you can try setting `FlutterError.demangleStackTrace` to `true` in your `main()` function before running the app:

```
Future<void> main() async {
  FlutterError.demangleStackTrace = true; // add this line
  await runZonedGuarded(
    () async {
      // your code here
    },
    (Object error, StackTrace stack) {
      debugPrint(error.toString());
      debugPrint(stack.toString());
    },
  );
}
```

This should ensure that the stack trace is in the expected format and prevent the error from occurring.
