It seems like the linker is unable to find the `libpq.lib` library file required for linking. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure that you have installed the PostgreSQL development libraries on your system. You can download them from the official PostgreSQL website.

2. Check if the `libpq.lib` file is present in the PostgreSQL installation directory. If it's not there, you may need to reinstall PostgreSQL and make sure to select the option to install the development libraries.

3. If the `libpq.lib` file is present, make sure that the directory containing it is included in the `LIB` environment variable. You can check this by running `echo %LIB%` in the command prompt.

4. If the `LIB` environment variable is not set correctly, you can set it manually by running the following command in the command prompt:
```
set LIB=C:\pgsql\lib;%LIB%
```
Replace `C:\pgsql\lib` with the path to the directory containing the `libpq.lib` file.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try specifying the path to the `libpq.lib` file explicitly using the `LIB` linker flag. You can do this by running the following command:
```
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres --target x86_64-pc-windows-msvc -L "C:\pgsql\lib"
```
Replace `C:\pgsql\lib` with the path to the directory containing the `libpq.lib` file.

I hope one of these solutions works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or issues.
