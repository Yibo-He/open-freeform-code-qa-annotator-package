There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure you have the latest version of Android Studio and Flutter installed.

2. Try creating a new AVD and see if it launches in the tool window.

3. Check if there are any updates available for the Android Emulator plugin. You can do this by going to "Settings -> Plugins -> Installed" and checking for updates.

4. Try running the emulator from the command line using the "flutter emulators" command. This will launch the emulator in a separate window, but you can then drag it into the Android Studio window.

5. If none of the above solutions work, you can try using a third-party emulator like Genymotion or BlueStacks, which may work better with Flutter.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
