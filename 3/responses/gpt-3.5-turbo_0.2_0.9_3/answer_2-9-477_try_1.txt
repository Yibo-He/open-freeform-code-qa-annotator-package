It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of some dependencies needed for Ruby. One thing you can try is to install the missing dependencies manually using Homebrew. 

First, make sure Homebrew is up to date by running `brew update`. Then, try installing the dependencies mentioned in the error message by running:

```
brew install openssl readline zlib libyaml
```

After that, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv install`. 

If that doesn't work, you can also try updating your version of rbenv by running `brew upgrade rbenv` and then trying the installation again. 

If you're still having issues, you can try looking at the log file mentioned in the error message (`/var/folders/rn/c7nmr3x12gg5r8qwsr4ty8hh0000gn/T/ruby-build.20210209143107.60561.log`) to see if there are any more specific error messages that might help diagnose the issue.
