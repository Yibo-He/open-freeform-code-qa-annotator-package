The formatting of your `pubspec.yaml` file seems to be incorrect. Here's the corrected version:

```
name: jsondata
description: A new Flutter application.
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0
dev_dependencies:
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

Make sure to follow the indentation and spacing as shown above. Also, ensure that the `loadjson` folder containing the `person.json` file is located in the root directory of your project.
