Yes, the first two lines and the last two lines are equivalent. Both `Provider.of` and `context.watch` will listen to changes in the model and rebuild the widget tree accordingly.

However, the error you are getting when using `context.read` inside the `build` method or the `update` callback of a provider is because `context.read` is meant to be used outside of the widget tree, such as in a button press or a lifecycle method. This is because `context.read` does not listen to changes in the model and will not rebuild the widget tree. Instead, it will simply return the current value of the model.

If you need to access the model inside the `build` method or the `update` callback of a provider, you should use `Provider.of` with `listen: false` to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.
