There could be a few reasons why the errorCallback takes a long time to get called on iOS. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Network connectivity issues: Check if the iOS device has a stable internet connection. If the device is connected to a weak or unstable network, it may take longer for the request to time out and trigger the errorCallback. You can try running the same code on a different network to see if the issue persists.

2. DNS resolution issues: If the server's IP address is resolved using DNS, there may be delays in resolving the domain name to an IP address. You can try using the server's IP address directly in the code instead of the domain name to see if it improves the response time.

3. Firewall or proxy issues: If the iOS device is behind a firewall or proxy server, it may be blocking the request or causing delays in the response. You can try disabling the firewall or proxy temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.

4. iOS-specific issues: There may be some iOS-specific issues that are causing the delay. You can try searching for similar issues on iOS developer forums or contacting Apple support for assistance.

In general, it's a good practice to set a timeout for the HTTP request to avoid waiting indefinitely for a response. You can set a timeout using the `HttpClientRequest.timeout` property.
