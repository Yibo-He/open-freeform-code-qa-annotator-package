To add a new pair to the Map, you can use the `putIfAbsent` method. Here's an example:

```
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap.putIfAbsent("c", () => 3);
```

This will add the key-value pair `"c": 3` to the Map only if the key `"c"` is not already present in the Map.

To use `Map.update`, you can pass the key and a function that takes the current value and returns the new value. Here's an example:

```
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap.update("c", (value) => value + 3, ifAbsent: () => 3);
```

This will update the value of the key `"c"` to `3` if it is not already present in the Map. If it is present, the function `(value) => value + 3` will be called with the current value of `"c"` and the returned value will be set as the new value.
