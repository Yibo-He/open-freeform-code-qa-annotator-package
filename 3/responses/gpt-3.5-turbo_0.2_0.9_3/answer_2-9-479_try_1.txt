Based on the log provided, it seems like there are some missing dependencies that are causing the installation errors. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Make sure you have all the necessary dependencies installed on your system. You can check the requirements for Ruby 2.1.2 on the official Ruby website.

2. Try installing Ruby 2.1.2 using a different version manager like rbenv or asdf. Sometimes, different version managers work better for different systems.

3. If you're still having issues, try installing an older version of Ruby like 2.0.0 or 1.9.3. These versions may have fewer dependencies and could be easier to install.

Regarding the error you're getting when trying to list gems, it seems like the OpenSSL library is not installed on your system. You can try installing it using a package manager like Homebrew (if you're on a Mac) or apt-get (if you're on Ubuntu). Once you have OpenSSL installed, try running `gem list` again and see if the error persists.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
