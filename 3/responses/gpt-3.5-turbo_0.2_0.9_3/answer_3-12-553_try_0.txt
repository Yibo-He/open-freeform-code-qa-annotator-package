The error message suggests that your app is not using AndroidX, which is a major change in the Android ecosystem that was introduced in 2018. To fix this issue, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do that:

1. Open your project in Android Studio.
2. Click on Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX.
3. Android Studio will show you a preview of the changes that will be made. Review them and click on Do Refactor.
4. Wait for the migration process to complete.

After the migration is complete, try running the `flutter build appbundle` command again. If the issue persists, try running the command with the `--verbose` flag to get more information about the error.
