It seems like the issue is related to the `path_provider` plugin. The error log indicates that the method `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` is not implemented on the channel `plugins.flutter.io/path_provider`. 

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file and ran `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Check if you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file where you are using it. You can add the following import statement at the top of your file:

   ```
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
   ```

3. Try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` to reinstall all the dependencies.

4. If the above steps don't work, try running `flutter doctor` to check if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. 

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try updating the `path_provider` plugin to the latest version by running `flutter pub upgrade`. 

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
