One way to automate this process is to use a code generation tool like `prost-build`. `prost-build` generates Rust code for protobuf messages based on a `.proto` file. You can define your message struct in a `.proto` file, and then use `prost-build` to generate the corresponding Rust code.

Once you have the Rust code generated, you can use the `From` trait to convert your `Source` struct to the corresponding `Message` struct. Here's an example implementation:

```
use prost::Message;

impl From<Source> for Message {
    fn from(source: Source) -> Self {
        let mut message = Message::default();
        message.email = source.email.to_string();
        message.name = source.name.to_string();
        message
    }
}
```

This implementation assumes that the `email` and `name` fields in `Source` are convertible to strings. If they are not, you will need to provide additional conversion logic.

With this implementation, you can convert a `Source` struct to a `Message` struct like this:

```
let source = Source { email: Email::new("foo@example.com"), name: Name::new("Foo Bar") };
let message: Message = source.into();
```

This will create a new `Message` struct with the `email` and `name` fields populated from the corresponding fields in the `Source` struct.
