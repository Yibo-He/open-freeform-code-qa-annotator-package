The issue is that when you assign `mylist = mynewlist`, you are not creating a new list, but rather pointing `mylist` to the same list object as `mynewlist`. Therefore, when you clear `mylist`, you are also clearing `mynewlist`.

To copy the values of `mynewlist` to `mylist` without affecting `mynewlist`, you can use the `addAll` method instead of assigning the list directly. Here's how you can modify your code:

```
mylist.addAll(mynewlist);
```

This will add all the elements of `mynewlist` to `mylist` without affecting `mynewlist`.
