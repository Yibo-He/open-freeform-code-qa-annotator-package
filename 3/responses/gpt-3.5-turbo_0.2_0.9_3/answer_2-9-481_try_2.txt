This error occurs when Sprockets, the asset pipeline used by Rails, cannot find the `manifest.js` file in the `app/assets/config` directory. This file is generated by the `rake assets:precompile` task and is used to map asset filenames to their compiled versions.

To fix this error, you can try running the `rake assets:precompile` task manually:

```
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

This should generate the `manifest.js` file and allow your app to boot.

If this doesn't work, you can try deleting the `tmp/cache` directory and running the `rake assets:precompile` task again:

```
rm -rf tmp/cache
bundle exec rake assets:precompile
```

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to investigate further to determine why the `manifest.js` file is not being generated properly.
