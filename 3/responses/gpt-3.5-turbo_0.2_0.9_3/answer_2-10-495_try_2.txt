The issue with your code is that the closure passed to `thread::spawn` captures a reference to the `s` variable, which has a lifetime that is tied to the `strings` vector. However, the threads may outlive the `strings` vector, which would result in a dangling reference.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move the ownership of the string into the closure, like this:

```
for s in strings {
    thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s)));
}
```

Note that we need to pass a mutable reference to the `child_job` function, so we need to use `&mut s` instead of just `s`.

With this change, the closure takes ownership of the string and moves it into the thread, so there is no longer a lifetime issue.

Here's the full code with the fix:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s)));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
``` 

I hope this helps!
