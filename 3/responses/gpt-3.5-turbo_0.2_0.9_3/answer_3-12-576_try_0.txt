You can use the `substring` method of the `String` class in Flutter to remove all characters after a specific character. Here's an example:

```dart
String myString = "one.two";
String newString = myString.substring(0, myString.indexOf('.'));
print(newString); // Output: "one"
```

In this example, we first define a `myString` variable with the value "one.two". We then use the `substring` method to extract the characters from the beginning of the string up to the index of the "." character. The `indexOf` method is used to find the index of the "." character in the string. Finally, we print the new string "one" to the console.

Note that if the "." character is not found in the string, the `indexOf` method will return -1, so you may want to add some error handling to your code to handle this case.
