Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter in `ChangeNotifierProvider` is deprecated since version 4.0.0 and has been replaced with `create`. You can remove the warning by replacing `builder` with `create` like this:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This should remove the warning and your code will work as expected.
