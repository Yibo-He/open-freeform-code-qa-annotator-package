The error message suggests that the `ListView` inside your `ListForm` widget was given unbounded height. This usually happens when a scrollable widget is nested inside another scrollable widget. In this case, the `ListView` is inside a `Row` widget which is inside a `Column` widget. The `Column` widget is scrollable by default, so nesting a `ListView` inside it can cause issues.

To fix this, you can wrap the `ListView` inside an `Expanded` widget. This will allow the `ListView` to take up all the remaining space in the `Row`. Here's the updated code for the `Row` widget:

```
new Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    new Expanded(
      child: new ListView.builder(
        itemCount: products.length,
        itemBuilder: (BuildContext ctxt, int index) {
          return new Text(products[index]);
        }
      ),
    ),
    new IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.remove_circle),
      onPressed: () { },
    )
  ],
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
),
```

This should fix the error and allow the `ListView` to be displayed properly.
