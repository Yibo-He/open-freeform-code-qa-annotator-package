The error message suggests that your app is not using AndroidX. To fix this, you need to migrate your app to AndroidX. Here are the steps to do so:

1. Open your Flutter project in Android Studio.
2. Click on Refactor > Migrate to AndroidX from the top menu.
3. Click on Migrate when prompted.
4. Wait for the migration process to complete.

After the migration is complete, try running the `flutter build appbundle` command again. If the issue persists, try running the command with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed error messages.
