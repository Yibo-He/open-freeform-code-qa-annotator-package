The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. You have specified version 5.6.2 in your project level build.gradle file, but it seems that this version is not available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

To fix this issue, you can try updating the version of the Android Gradle plugin to a more recent version. You can do this by changing the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

to:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

This will update the Android Gradle plugin to version 4.1.0, which should be available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

After making this change, try running your app again and see if the issue is resolved. If you continue to experience issues, you may need to check your Gradle configuration and ensure that all required dependencies are properly configured.
