Yes, the comment is correct. A constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created. It is used to initialize the object's state and allocate memory for it.

While a constructor may look like a function, it is not considered a regular function because it has a different purpose and behavior. For example, a constructor does not have a return type and cannot be called directly like a regular function. Instead, it is called implicitly when an object is created using the `new` keyword.

However, you can still call a constructor indirectly by using the `call` or `apply` method of a constructor function. This allows you to reuse the constructor logic for creating new objects without having to define a new constructor function.

In summary, a constructor is a special method that is automatically called when an object is created, and while it may look like a function, it is not considered a regular function because of its unique purpose and behavior.
