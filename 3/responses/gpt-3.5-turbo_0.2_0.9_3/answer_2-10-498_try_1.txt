In Rust, the caret operator (`^`) is not used for exponentiation, but for bitwise XOR. To perform exponentiation, you can use the `pow` method from the `std::ops::Pow` trait. Here's an example:

```rust
let base = 2;
let exponent = 10;
let result = base.pow(exponent);
assert_eq!(result, 1024);
```

In this example, we use the `pow` method to raise the integer `base` to the power of `exponent`. The result is stored in the `result` variable, which is then checked against the expected value using the `assert_eq` macro.

Note that the `pow` method returns a `u32` or `u64` depending on the size of the integer type used for the base. If you need to perform exponentiation with floating-point numbers, you can use the `powf` method from the `std::f64` module.
