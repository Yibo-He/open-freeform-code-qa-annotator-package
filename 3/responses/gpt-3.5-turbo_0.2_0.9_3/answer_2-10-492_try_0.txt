To transfer native SOL directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction, you can use the `system_instruction::transfer` method provided by the Solana SDK. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```
use solana_program::{
    account_info::{next_account_info, AccountInfo},
    entrypoint::ProgramResult,
    program_error::ProgramError,
    pubkey::Pubkey,
    system_instruction,
};

// ...

pub fn deposit_sol_to_event_account(
    program_id: &Pubkey,
    accounts: &[AccountInfo],
    amount: u64,
) -> ProgramResult {
    let accounts_iter = &mut accounts.iter();
    let event_account_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    let event_vault_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;
    let source_user_info = next_account_info(accounts_iter)?;

    // Check if the event account is owned by the program
    if event_account_info.owner != program_id {
        return Err(ProgramError::IncorrectProgramId);
    }

    // Transfer SOL from the source user to the event vault
    let transfer_instruction = system_instruction::transfer(
        source_user_info.key,
        event_vault_info.key,
        amount,
    );
    solana_program::program::invoke_signed(
        &transfer_instruction,
        &[source_user_info.clone()],
        &[&[&b"transfer"[..], &event_account_info.key.to_bytes()]],
    )?;

    // Update the event account balance
    let mut event_account_data = event_account_info.try_borrow_mut_data()?;
    let event_account_balance = &mut event_account_data[0..8];
    let new_balance = u64::from_le_bytes(*event_account_balance) + amount;
    *event_account_balance = new_balance.to_le_bytes();

    Ok(())
}
```

In this example, we use the `system_instruction::transfer` method to transfer SOL from the source user to the event vault. We then update the event account balance by adding the transferred amount to the existing balance.

Note that you'll need to pass the `source_user_info` account as a signer for the `invoke_signed` method to work. Also, make sure to check that the event account is owned by the program before updating its balance.

Regarding your original question, the `token::transfer` method you mentioned is used for transferring SPL tokens, not native SOL. The `PROGRAM_ACCOUNT` parameter should be the account that handles the SPL token you want to transfer. If you want to transfer native SOL, you'll need to use the `system_instruction::transfer` method as shown above.
