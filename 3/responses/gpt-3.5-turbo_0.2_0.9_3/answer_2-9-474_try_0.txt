Based on the error message, it seems that there is a superclass mismatch for the `StringIO` class. This could be caused by a conflict between different versions of the `stringio` gem or a similar gem that defines the `StringIO` class.

One possible solution is to try updating the `stringio` gem to the latest version or a compatible version with your other gems. You can do this by running `bundle update stringio` in your terminal.

If that doesn't work, you can try removing the `stringio` gem from your Gemfile and running `bundle install` to see if the error goes away. However, this may cause other issues if the gem is needed by other dependencies.

It's also worth checking if you have multiple versions of the `bundler` gem installed, as this can sometimes cause conflicts. You can check this by running `gem list | grep bundl` in your terminal. If you have multiple versions, try uninstalling the older versions and keeping only the latest one.
