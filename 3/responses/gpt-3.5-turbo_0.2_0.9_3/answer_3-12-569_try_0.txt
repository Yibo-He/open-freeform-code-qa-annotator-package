Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter in `ChangeNotifierProvider` has been deprecated since version 4.0.0 and removed in version 5.0.0. The recommended way to create the provider now is to use the `create` parameter instead of `builder`.

Here's how you can modify your code to remove the warning:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This should remove the warning and ensure that your code is up-to-date with the latest version of the provider package.
