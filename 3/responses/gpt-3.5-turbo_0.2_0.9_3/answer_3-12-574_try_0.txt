You can use the `DateFormat` class to format the `DateTime` object and extract the name of the day of the week. Here's an example:

```
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
String dayOfWeek = DateFormat('EEEE').format(date);
print(dayOfWeek); // Output: Friday
```

In this example, the `DateFormat` pattern `'EEEE'` represents the full name of the day of the week. You can use other patterns to extract different parts of the date and time.
