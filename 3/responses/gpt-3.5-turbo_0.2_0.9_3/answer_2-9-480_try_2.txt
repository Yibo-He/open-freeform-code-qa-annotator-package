The error message suggests that there is a problem with the `kramdown` gem, which is used for parsing Markdown files in Jekyll. Specifically, it seems that the `rexml/parsers/baseparser` file cannot be loaded.

One possible solution is to try uninstalling and reinstalling the `kramdown` gem:

```
gem uninstall kramdown
gem install kramdown
```

If that doesn't work, you could try updating all gems in your project:

```
bundle update
```

If neither of these solutions work, you could try removing the `Gemfile.lock` file and running `bundle install` again:

```
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install
```

If you're still having issues, it might be helpful to check the versions of Ruby and other dependencies you're using, and compare them to the versions used in your other working project.
