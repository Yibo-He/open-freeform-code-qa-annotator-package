The warning is still present in the second snippet because the analyzer is not able to determine that the `if` statement guarantees that the value retrieved from the map will not be `null`. Even though `containsKey` checks if the key exists in the map, it does not guarantee that the value associated with the key is not `null`. 

To resolve the warning, you can either change the type of the variable to `String?` to allow for `null` values, or use a null-aware operator like `myMap[1] ?? defaultValue` to provide a default value in case the retrieved value is `null`. Alternatively, you can cast the value to `String` if you are certain that it will not be `null`, but this can lead to runtime errors if the value does end up being `null`.
