In Rails 6, you can import your own JavaScript files by using the `import` statement in your `application.js` file. Here's an example:

1. Create a new folder under `app/javascript` called `custom_js`.
2. Add your JavaScript files to the `custom_js` folder.
3. In `application.js`, add the following line to import your JavaScript files:

```
import '../custom_js/your_file_name.js';
```

Make sure to replace `your_file_name.js` with the actual name of your JavaScript file.

You can also use the `require` statement to import your JavaScript files:

```
require('../custom_js/your_file_name.js');
```

After importing your JavaScript files, you can use them in your Rails application.
