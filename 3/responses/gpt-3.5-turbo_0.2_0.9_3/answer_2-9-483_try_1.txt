In Rails 6, you can load your own JavaScript files by using the `javascript_pack_tag` helper method in your layout file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new folder under `app/javascript` for your custom JavaScript files. For example, you can create a folder called `custom`.

2. Create a new JavaScript file in your custom folder. For example, you can create a file called `custom.js`.

3. In your `application.js` file located in `app/javascript/packs`, add the following line to require your custom JavaScript file:

   ```
   require("custom/custom")
   ```

4. In your layout file (e.g. `application.html.erb`), add the following line to load your custom JavaScript file:

   ```
   <%= javascript_pack_tag 'custom' %>
   ```

   This will include your custom JavaScript file in the HTML document.

5. Restart your Rails server and your custom JavaScript file should now be loaded.

Note that the `javascript_pack_tag` helper method will automatically include the JavaScript file located in `app/javascript/packs` with the same name as the argument passed to the method. In this case, the argument is `'custom'`, so it will include the file `custom.js` located in `app/javascript/packs`.
