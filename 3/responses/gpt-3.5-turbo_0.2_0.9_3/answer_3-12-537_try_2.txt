The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. In your project level build.gradle file, you have specified the version of the Android Gradle plugin as 5.6.2, which is not the latest version.

To fix this issue, you can update the version of the Android Gradle plugin to the latest version, which is 4.1.0. To do this, replace the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

with:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

After making this change, sync your project with Gradle by clicking on the "Sync Now" button in the top right corner of Android Studio. Once the sync is complete, try running your app again.
