The error message indicates that there is an unexpected character at the beginning of the JSON string. The character sequence `ï»¿` is a byte order mark (BOM) that is sometimes added to the beginning of a file by certain text editors or tools.

To fix this issue, you can try removing the BOM from the PHP file. You can do this by opening the file in a text editor that supports encoding detection and saving the file with a different encoding that does not include the BOM, such as UTF-8 without BOM.

Alternatively, you can modify your Dart code to handle the BOM by skipping the first three bytes of the response body before decoding the JSON string. Here's an example:

```
var response = await http.post(
    url,
    headers:{ "Accept": "application/json" } ,
    body: { "usuario": '$usuario',"password": '$password'},
    encoding: Encoding.getByName("utf-8")
);
var responseBody = response.bodyBytes;
if (responseBody.length >= 3 && responseBody[0] == 0xEF && responseBody[1] == 0xBB && responseBody[2] == 0xBF) {
  responseBody = responseBody.sublist(3);
}
List data = json.decode(utf8.decode(responseBody));
``` 

This code checks if the first three bytes of the response body match the UTF-8 BOM and removes them if they do. Then it decodes the remaining bytes as a UTF-8 string and parses the JSON data.
