There are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure that your mobile device is connected to the same network as your computer. Sometimes, if the devices are on different networks, the installation process can fail.

2. Check that your mobile device has enough storage space to install the app. If the device is low on storage, the installation process may fail.

3. Try restarting both your computer and your mobile device. This can sometimes resolve issues with the installation process.

4. If none of the above solutions work, try running the app on a different mobile device to see if the issue is specific to your current device.

5. If you are still having issues, try running the app in release mode instead of debug mode. To do this, run the following command instead of `flutter run`:

```
flutter run --release
```

This will build the app in release mode, which can sometimes resolve issues with the installation process.
