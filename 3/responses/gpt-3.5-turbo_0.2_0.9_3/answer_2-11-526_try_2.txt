1. In C, variable declarations must be placed at the beginning of a block (i.e. before any statements), whereas in C++ variable declarations can be placed anywhere within a block. Therefore, in the C code, the declaration of `a` inside the `if` statement violates this rule and causes a compilation error.

2. The difference exists because C++ was designed to be a superset of C, meaning it includes all of the features of C and adds additional features on top of that. One of these additional features is the ability to declare variables anywhere within a block. This was added to make the language more flexible and easier to use in certain situations. However, it also means that some code that is valid in C++ may not be valid in C.
