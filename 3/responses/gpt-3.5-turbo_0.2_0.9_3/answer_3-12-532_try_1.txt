The error message indicates that there is an unexpected character at the beginning of the JSON response. The character sequence `ï»¿` is a byte order mark (BOM) that is sometimes added to the beginning of a file to indicate its encoding. 

To fix this issue, you can try removing the BOM from the PHP file by saving it with a different encoding. You can also try to remove the BOM programmatically by adding the following code at the beginning of your PHP file:

```
<?php
ob_start("ob_gzhandler");
header("Content-Encoding: gzip");
?>
```

This code will compress the output of your PHP script and remove the BOM. 

Alternatively, you can try to remove the BOM in your Dart code by adding the following line before decoding the JSON:

```
response.body = response.body.replaceFirst('\uFEFF', '');
```

This code will replace the BOM character with an empty string before decoding the JSON.
