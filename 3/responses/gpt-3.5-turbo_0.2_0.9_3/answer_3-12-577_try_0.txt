The error message you are seeing indicates that the Gradle task `assembleDebug` failed with exit code -1. This could be caused by a number of issues, including problems with your Android SDK installation or configuration.

The error message you received when running `flutter doctor` suggests that there may be an issue with your Android SDK installation or configuration. Specifically, it indicates that the Android license status is unknown, and suggests that you try re-installing or updating your Android SDK Manager.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Open Android Studio and go to the SDK Manager (you can find it in the Welcome to Android Studio window, or in the File menu).
2. Make sure that the Android SDK version 29.0.2 is installed. If it is not, install it.
3. Go to the SDK Tools tab and make sure that the Android SDK Build-Tools version 28.0.3 is installed. If it is not, install it.
4. Accept the Android SDK licenses by running the following command in your terminal: `flutter doctor --android-licenses`.
5. Restart Android Studio and try running your Flutter project again.

If the issue persists, you can try running `flutter clean` to clean the build cache, and then running `flutter run` again.

If none of these steps work, you may need to provide more information about the error message you are seeing, such as the full stack trace or any other error messages that appear in the console.
