Importing images in TypeScript React - "Cannot find module"

I am trying to import images to use inside a React component with TypeScript. The bundler I'm using is Parcel (not Webpack).

I have created a `.d.ts` file inside the project with the image file extension, and included it inside `tsconfig.json`. However, when I try to import an image, TS yells at me about `Cannot find module`.

My project structure:

```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.d.ts
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```


I tried to import the image in `App.tsx` like this. VS Code underlined  `'../assets/image.jpg'` and said `Cannot find module '../assets/image.jpg'`.

```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```


The discussions I found online point to the need of defining a `.d.ts` file myself, so I created that `index.d.ts` file with this line.

```
declare module '*.jpg';
```


Then added `"include": ["./src/index.d.ts"]` inside `tsconfig.json`, after `"compilerOptions" : {...}`.

What did I miss? How can I fix the error TS is throwing?
