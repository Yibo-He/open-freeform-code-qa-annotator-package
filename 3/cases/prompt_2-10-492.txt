How to transfer SOL in anchor smart contract instruction

I am creating a dapp where multiple users can deposit SOL into an event account, and depending on whoever wins the event, they can redeem SOL back to their wallet.
How can I transfer native SOL (not any other spl-token) directly into the event account's vault address in an anchor smart contract instruction?
Would the following anchor instruction work?
If yes, what should be the `PROGRAM_ACCOUNT` in the following? Presumably, it should be the account that handles native SOL, but I couldn't find it in the documentation.
```
token::transfer(
    CpiContext::new(
        PROGRAM_ACCOUNT,
        anchor_spl::token::Transfer {
            from: source_user_info,
            to: destination_user_info,
            authority: source_user_info,
        },
    ),
    1,
)?;
```

Thanks in advance!
