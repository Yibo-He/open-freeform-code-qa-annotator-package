How to add a new pair to Map in Dart?

I caught the following errors when adding a new pair to a Map.
- `Variables must be declared using the keywords const, final, var, or a type name`- `Expected to find;`- `the name someMap is already defined`
I executed the following code.
```
Map<String, int> someMap = {
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2,
};

someMap["c"] = 3;
```

How should I add a new pair to the Map?
I'd also like to know how to use `Map.update`.
