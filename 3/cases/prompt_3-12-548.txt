What is the right way to disable back button in flutter when one has reached the login page after logging out?

I want to restrict the user from viewing inner pages of the app after the user has logged out and has been redirected to the login page. What I know so far is the use of `Navigator.pop(context)` or `Navigator.of(context).pop()` to move back to a previous page. But this isn't fitting in the use case I have mentioned (or maybe I don't know).
