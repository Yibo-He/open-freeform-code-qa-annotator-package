What is the idiomatic way to do something when an Option is either None, or the inner value meets some condition?

Is there a more idiomatic way to express something like the following?
```
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    match foo {
        Some(foo_val) if ! (foo_val < 5) /* i.e. the negation of my acceptance condition */ => {}
        _ => { foo.replace(5); }
    }
}
```

It seems like most of the time there's an alternative to having an arm that doesn't do anything, but I've been unable to find one for this particular case.
What I'd like to say is the more direct `if foo.is_none() || /* some way to extract and test the inner value */ { ... }`, or perhaps some chaining trick that's eluding me.
