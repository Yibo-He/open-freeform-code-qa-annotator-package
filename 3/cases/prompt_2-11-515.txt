Create a vector of pairs from a single vector in C++

I have a single even-sized vector that I want to transform into a vector of pairs where each pair contains always two elements. I know that I can do this using simple loops but I was wondering if there is a nice standard-library tool for this? It can be assumed that the original vector always contains an even amount of elements.
Example:
```
vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

vector<pair<int, int>> goal { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
```
