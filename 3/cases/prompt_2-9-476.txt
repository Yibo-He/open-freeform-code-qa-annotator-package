.zshenv:2: command not found: rbenv

When switching from bash to zsh, I looked up how to resolve an issue with my rbenv folder not being used correctly by zsh and found this: 

```
$ echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.rbenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshenv
$ echo 'eval "$(rbenv init -)"' >> ~/.zshenv
$ echo 'source $HOME/.zshenv' >> ~/.zshrc
$ exec $SHELL
```


I ran all of these and seem to be using the correct rbenv folder now, but I get this error message whenever I open a new iTerm window: 

```
/Users/myname/.zshenv:2: command not found: rbenv
```


What am I doing wrong? Any help would be very appreciated.
