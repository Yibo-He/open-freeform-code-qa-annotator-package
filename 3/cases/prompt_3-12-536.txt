Create a button with rounded border

How would you make a `FlatButton` into a button with a rounded border? I have the rounded border shape using `RoundedRectangleBorder` but somehow need to color the border.

```
new FlatButton(
  child: new Text("Button text),
  onPressed: null,
  shape: new RoundedRectangleBorder(borderRadius: new BorderRadius.circular(30.0))
)
```
