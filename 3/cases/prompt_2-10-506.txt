How to get the minimum value within a vector in Rust?

I'm trying to display the minimum value within a vector in Rust and can't find a good way to do so.
Given a vector of `i32` :
```
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
```

My goal here is to get the minimum value of that vector without having to sort it.
What is the best way to get the minimum value within a `Vec<i32>` in Rust ?
