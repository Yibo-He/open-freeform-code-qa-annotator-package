clang format: disable ordering includes

In our C++ project, the order of our includes is regularly changed. This is a problem since we are using some third-party libraries which require a specific include order to avoid problems. 

I know, this is bad but we have to deal with it. 

Unfortunately, the order of our includes is regularly changed and I suppose that this is due to `clang-format`. I found a [page](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) where you can specify a variable `includeCategories`. 
However, I do not fully understand how it works. 
I simply want to completely disable the ordering of includes. 
How can I do this?
