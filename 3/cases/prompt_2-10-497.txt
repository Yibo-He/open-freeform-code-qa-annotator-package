How to check if a Box is a null pointer?

I want to implement a stack using pointers or something. How can I check if a `Box` is a null pointer? I seen some code with `Option<Box<T>>` and `Box<Option<T>>` but I don't understand this. This is as far as I went:
```
struct Node {
    value: i32,
    next: Box<Node>,
}

struct Stack {
    top: Box<Node>,
}
```
