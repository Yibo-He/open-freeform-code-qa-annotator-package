Your app isn't using AndroidX - Flutter doesn't allow me to generate apk

I developed an app in flutter with Visual Studio code on Mac. I ran the application without any kind of problem on IOS. I also installed it on a physical device and it works perfectly, but I have a problem generating the Android project study and its APK on with flutter.

: 

```
flutter build appbundle

Gradle build failed to produce an .aab file. It's likely that this file was generated under
/Users/riccardo/Desktop/QuoteFlutter/quote/build, but the tool couldn't find it.
