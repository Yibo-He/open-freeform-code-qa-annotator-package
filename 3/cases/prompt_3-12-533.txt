Flutter - Detect Tap on the Screen that is filled with other Widgets

I am trying to detect a tap on the screen. I've tried multiple variation of using the `GestureDetector` but that just leads to the app detecting tap on the  and .

Here is the code:

```
class QQHome extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      debugShowCheckedModeBanner: false,
      theme: ThemeData(
        primaryColor: Colors.blueGrey,
      ),
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          centerTitle: true,
          title: Text('QuoteQuota'),
        ),
        body: GestureDetector(
          onTap: () => print('Tapped'),
          child: QQBody(),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

class QQBody extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Center(
      child: Text(
        'Hello, World!'
      ),
    );
  }
}
```


Output: "tapped" printed when I click "Hello, World!".

Expected Output: "tapped" printed when I click anywhere on the screen with Text in the Center.

How do I do this?
