Simplest syntax for string interpolation in c++

I'm used to easy-to-read syntax for string interpolation like this in c# or JavaScript, so when I started learning c++ I expected that it will have a similar feature, but when googling for string interpolation in c++ I couldn't find anything like that.
In c# strings are interpolated like this:
```
$"My variable has value {myVariable}"
```

In JavaScript it looks like this:
```
`My variable has value ${myVariable}`
```

Inserting multiple values in different places in a string literal is such a common problem I'm sure there is some standard way of doing this in c++. I want to know what is the simplest way of doing this in c++ and how do people usually do it.
