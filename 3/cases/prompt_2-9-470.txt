libffi.so.6: cannot open shared object file in rails

I'm newbie in rails and I'm working on Ubuntu 19.10 yesterday I decide to upgrade my OS to new version every things is going fine after upgrading finished after t i start to use my computer to develop that found any rails command not works and showed me this error
```
in `require': libffi.so.6: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory - /home/ace/.rbenv/versions/2.7.1/lib/ruby/gems/2.7.0/gems/ffi-1.13.1/lib/ffi_c.so (LoadError)
```

I found people with same issues but none of them have problem in rails and any of them is useful for me .
I think the problem is about libffi.so.6 package because ffi-1.13.1 is installed on my OS
