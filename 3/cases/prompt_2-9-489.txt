How to fix this in error rails "warning: 299 Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could..."

I have a Rails app that uses Searchkick and after updating my gems and yarn, I'm getting this Elasticsearch warning"
```
warning: 299 Elasticsearch-7.13.1-9a7758028e4ea59bcab41c12004603c5a7dd84a9 "Elasticsearch built-in security features are not enabled. Without authentication, your cluster could be accessible to anyone. See https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html to enable security."
```

I tried following the instructions at the [webpage mentioned](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.13/security-minimal-setup.html), but I'm getting stuck at the `run the elasticsearch-setup-passwords utility` step. I can't find this script anywhere.
I'm currently on an M1 Mac, but running terminal with Rosetta, so homebrew was installed with Rosetta.
This is just for my development machine, so it doesn't seem like security is that important and previous versions of Elasticsearch installed with Homebrew did not display this warning.
Here's what I'm running now:
- - - `brew install Elasticsearch``brew services start elasticsearch`- 
Is there a way to ignore this message? Or how do I fix this? It's so large in my console that I can't read my tests.
