The expression `new int;` such as in `int * x = new int;` is a [new expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new). The term "new operator" seems to be used interchangeably with "new expression", for example in this question : [Difference between 'new operator' and 'operator new'?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885849/difference-between-new-operator-and-operator-new)
Is it correct to say that the keyword [new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/new) as it is used in a new expression is an operator? Why or why not?
If not, is there another justification for calling a new expression "new operator"?
I am having trouble finding an authoritative definition for what constitutes an operator.
I already understand the distinction between [operator new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new) which allocates memory for an object and "new expression" which may eventually call an `operator new`.

Yes, it is correct to say that the keyword `new` as it is used in a new expression is an operator. In C++, an operator is a symbol or keyword that represents a specific operation to be performed on one or more operands. The `new` operator is used to allocate memory dynamically for an object and return a pointer to that object. 

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` keyword is used as part of the expression to allocate memory. However, it is important to note that the `new` operator is not the same as the `operator new` function. The `operator new` function is a built-in function that is called by the `new` operator to allocate memory, but it is not an operator itself.

In summary, the `new` keyword as used in a new expression is an operator because it represents a specific operation to be performed on an operand (in this case, allocating memory dynamically). The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" but it is important to distinguish between the `new` operator and the `operator new` function.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, it is correct to say that the keyword `new` as it is used in a new expression is an operator. In fact, the C++ standard defines `new` as a "new-expression" operator. 

An operator is a symbol or keyword that represents an operation to be performed on one or more operands. In the case of `new`, it is used to allocate memory for an object and construct the object in that memory. This is similar to other operators like `+` which perform addition on operands.

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` keyword is used to create a new object and allocate memory for it. However, it is important to note that `new` is not a standalone operator like `+` or `-`. It is a keyword that is used as part of a new expression to allocate memory and construct an object.

In summary, it is correct to call the `new` keyword an operator when used in a new expression, but it is not a standalone operator like other operators in C++.

Yes, it is correct to say that the keyword `new` as it is used in a new expression is an operator. In C++, an operator is a symbol or keyword that represents an operation to be performed on one or more operands. The `new` operator is used to dynamically allocate memory for an object and return a pointer to that object. 

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` operator is used in a new expression to allocate memory for an object. However, it is important to note that the `new` operator is not the same as the `operator new` function, which is used to allocate memory for an object but does not construct the object.

In summary, the `new` keyword as used in a new expression is an operator because it represents an operation to be performed on an operand (the size of the object to be allocated). The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` operator is used in a new expression to allocate memory for an object.
