I have this code in my main.dart:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(builder: (context) => Auth()), // /**problem here. builder displayed with strikethrough line**/
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```


since about 2 days ago, my visual studio code showing this warning:

[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/7hSyw.png)

so I guess builder parameter on ChangeNotifierProvider is deprecated. I searched everywhere but can't find alternative to this builder parameter. So how to remove these warning? Below is my flutter version using `flutter --version` command on Windows 10

```
> flutter --version
Flutter 1.9.1+hotfix.6 • channel stable • https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework • revision 68587a0916 (3 months ago) • 2019-09-13 19:46:58 -0700
Engine • revision b863200c37
Tools • Dart 2.5.0
```


For any help, thanks in advance

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter in `ChangeNotifierProvider` has been deprecated since version 4.0.0 and removed in version 5.0.0. The recommended way to create the provider now is to use the `create` parameter instead of `builder`.

Here's how you can modify your code to remove the warning:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This should remove the warning and ensure that your code is up-to-date with the latest version of the provider package.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter on `ChangeNotifierProvider` has been deprecated since version 4.0.0 and has been replaced with `create`. Here's how you can update your code to remove the warning:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

By using `create` instead of `builder`, you can remove the warning and continue to use `ChangeNotifierProvider` as before.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, you are correct. The `builder` parameter in `ChangeNotifierProvider` is deprecated since version 4.0.0 and has been replaced with `create`. You can remove the warning by replacing `builder` with `create` like this:

```
main() {
  runApp(
    MultiProvider(
      providers: [
        ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Auth()), // use create instead of builder
      ],
      child: App(),
    ),
  );
}
```

This should remove the warning and your code will work as expected.
