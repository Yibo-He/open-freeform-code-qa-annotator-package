In our C++ project, the order of our includes is regularly changed. This is a problem since we are using some third-party libraries which require a specific include order to avoid problems. 

I know, this is bad but we have to deal with it. 

Unfortunately, the order of our includes is regularly changed and I suppose that this is due to `clang-format`. I found a [page](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/ClangFormatStyleOptions.html) where you can specify a variable `includeCategories`. 
However, I do not fully understand how it works. 
I simply want to completely disable the ordering of includes. 
How can I do this?

Have you tried: `SortIncludes: false`?
You can generate a `.clang-format` with preview here: [https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/](https://zed0.co.uk/clang-format-configurator/)

To disable sorting for the whole project use `SortIncludes:false` in `.clang-format`.

To disable clang-format only for a specific file region, use `// clang-format off/on` comments.

```
// clang-format off
#include <b.h>
#include <a.h>
#include <c.h>
// clang-format on
#include <d.h>
#include <e.h>
```

`SortIncludes: Never` to `.clang-format`
