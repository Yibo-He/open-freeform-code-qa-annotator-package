I looked at this [Ruby installation (2.2.2) fails in macOS Big Sur](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65524323/ruby-installation-2-2-2-fails-in-macos-big-sur)
My macOS is Big Sur and the version I have is 11.2 and it was the closest I could find to the issue I'm having with my OS, I followed what I could by trying
```
CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" rbenv install 2.5.3
```

and also
```
RUBY_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FFI_CLOSURE_ALLOC rbenv install 2.5.3
```

This is the output in my Terminal:

I get this error for both commands mentioned above and both give this same output.
The version of Ruby also doesn't seem to matter, I've tried 3.0.0 as well and get the same results.
Additionally this is the original output when I try to just install ruby with `rbenv install`

xcode-select version is 2384.
Homebrew version is 3.0.0 and `brew doctor` say's I'm ready to brew.
My .zshrc file also contains this line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`
At this point I'm not sure where else to turn

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error you're seeing is likely due to a compatibility issue between the older version of Ruby you're trying to install and the newer version of macOS Big Sur you're using. 

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Update Ruby-Build and rbenv**: Make sure you have the latest versions of both Ruby-Build and rbenv. You can update them using Homebrew:

   ```
   brew upgrade ruby-build rbenv
   ```

2. **Install a newer version of Ruby**: As the error message suggests, Ruby 2.5.3 is nearing its end of life and only receives critical security updates. Try installing a newer version of Ruby that's more likely to be compatible with macOS Big Sur. For example, you can try installing Ruby 2.7.2 or Ruby 3.0.0:

   ```
   rbenv install 2.7.2
   ```

   or 

   ```
   rbenv install 3.0.0
   ```

3. **Install Ruby using RVM instead of rbenv**: If you're still having trouble, you might want to try using RVM (Ruby Version Manager) instead of rbenv. RVM is another tool for managing multiple Ruby environments. Here's how you can install it:

   ```
   \curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
   ```

   Then, you can use RVM to install Ruby:

   ```
   rvm install 2.7.2
   ```

   or 

   ```
   rvm install 3.0.0
   ```

Remember to replace "2.7.2" or "3.0.0" with the version of Ruby you want to install. 

If none of these solutions work, please provide the full error log so we can better understand the issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is due to a change in macOS 11 Big Sur. The system no longer includes certain header files that Ruby versions prior to 2.7.2 require to build.

You have two options to resolve this issue:

1. Upgrade to a newer version of Ruby that supports macOS Big Sur. Ruby 2.7.2 and later versions have been patched to build on macOS Big Sur. You can install it with `rbenv install 2.7.2`.

2. If you need to use an older version of Ruby, you can patch the Ruby source code to work with macOS Big Sur. Here's how you can do it:

- First, download the Ruby source code for the version you want to install. For example, for Ruby 2.5.3, you can download it from https://cache.ruby-lang.org/pub/ruby/2.5/ruby-2.5.3.tar.bz2.
- Extract the tarball and open the file `ruby-2.5.3/thread_pthread.c` in a text editor.
- Find the line `#  include "/usr/include/pthread/pthread.h"` and comment it out by adding a `//` at the beginning of the line.
- Save the file and compress the Ruby source code back into a tarball.
- Move the tarball to the directory `~/.rbenv/cache/`.
- Now you can install Ruby with `rbenv install 2.5.3`.

Please note that the second option is a workaround and may not work for all older versions of Ruby. It's generally recommended to use a version of Ruby that officially supports your operating system.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error you're encountering seems to be related to the version of Ruby you're trying to install and the version of macOS you're using. Ruby 2.5.3 is quite old and may not be compatible with macOS Big Sur. 

However, if you still want to install this specific version of Ruby, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure you have the latest versions of rbenv and ruby-build. You can update them using Homebrew:

```bash
brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
```

2. Install the older version of OpenSSL:

```bash
brew install openssl@1.0
```

3. Set the OpenSSL path for the Ruby installation:

```bash
RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=`brew --prefix openssl@1.0`" rbenv install 2.5.3
```

This will tell the Ruby installation to use the older version of OpenSSL, which should be compatible with Ruby 2.5.3.

If you don't specifically need Ruby 2.5.3, I would recommend installing a newer version of Ruby that is compatible with macOS Big Sur. You can install the latest version of Ruby with:

```bash
rbenv install 3.0.0
```

Remember to set the global version after the installation:

```bash
rbenv global 3.0.0
```

And then verify that the new version is being used:

```bash
ruby -v
```

This should output something like `ruby 3.0.0p0 (2020-12-25 revision 95aff21468)`.
