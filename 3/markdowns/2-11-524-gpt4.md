My platform is a Mac. I'm a C++ beginner and working on a personal project which processes Chinese and English. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for this project.
I read some posts on StackÂ Overflow, and many of them suggest using `std::string` when dealing with UTF-8 and avoid `wchar_t` as there's no `char8_t` right now for UTF-8.
However, none of them talk about how to properly deal with functions like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()` or `std::regex` as these function usually returns unexpected results when facing UTF-8.
Should I go ahead with `std::string` or switch to `std::wstring`? If I should stay with `std::string`, what's the best practice for one to handle the above problems?

You should stick with `std::string` for UTF-8. The reason is that UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, meaning that a single Unicode character can be represented by 1 to 4 bytes. `std::string` is a byte-oriented container, which is suitable for UTF-8.

However, as you've noticed, this can cause problems when you use functions like `std::string::size()`, `std::string::operator[]`, `std::string::find_first_of()`, and `std::regex`, because these functions operate on bytes, not on Unicode characters.

Here are some tips to handle these problems:

1. **String Length**: If you want to get the number of Unicode characters in a string, you can't use `std::string::size()`. Instead, you need to iterate over the string and count the number of Unicode characters. There are libraries that can help with this, such as the ICU library.

2. **Accessing Characters**: Similarly, you can't use `std::string::operator[]` to access a Unicode character by its index. You need to iterate over the string to find the character. Again, libraries like ICU can help with this.

3. **Searching and Regular Expressions**: For searching and regular expressions, you need to use a library that supports Unicode. The standard `std::regex` does not support Unicode well. You can use libraries like Boost.Regex with the `boost::locale::generator` and `boost::locale::utf8` for this purpose.

4. **Conversion**: If you need to convert between different encodings, use a library like ICU or Boost.Locale.

In general, dealing with Unicode in C++ can be tricky, and it's usually a good idea to use a library that handles the complexities for you.

You should stick with `std::string` for UTF-8. The reason is that UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, meaning that a single Unicode character can be encoded as 1 to 4 bytes. `std::string` is a byte-oriented container, which is suitable for UTF-8.

However, you're correct that the standard string operations like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()` or `std::regex` will not work as expected with UTF-8 strings, because they operate on bytes, not Unicode characters.

Here are some tips to handle these issues:

1. **Indexing and Size**: You should avoid direct indexing into a UTF-8 string with `str[i]`, because this will give you a byte, not a Unicode character. Similarly, `std::string::size()` will give you the number of bytes, not the number of characters. If you need to iterate over Unicode characters in a UTF-8 string, you should use a library that supports UTF-8, like ICU.

2. **Searching**: Functions like `std::string::find_first_of()` will not work correctly with UTF-8, because they operate on bytes. If you need to search for a Unicode character in a UTF-8 string, you should use a UTF-8-aware function or library.

3. **Regular Expressions**: The `std::regex` library does not support UTF-8. If you need to use regular expressions with UTF-8 strings, you should use a library that supports UTF-8, like Boost.Regex with the `boost::regex::utf8` flag.

4. **Conversion**: If you need to convert between UTF-8 and other encodings, you should use a library that supports this, like ICU or Boost.Locale.

In general, dealing with Unicode and UTF-8 in C++ can be tricky, because the standard library does not provide much support for it. However, there are many third-party libraries available that can help, like ICU, Boost.Locale, and Boost.Regex.

You should stick with `std::string` for UTF-8 encoding. The reason is that UTF-8 is a variable-length encoding, and each character can take 1 to 4 bytes. `std::string` is a byte-oriented container, which is suitable for UTF-8.

However, as you've noticed, functions like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()`, and `std::regex` can give unexpected results because they operate on bytes, not on Unicode code points or graphemes.

Here are some tips on how to handle these issues:

1. **Indexing (`str[i]`)**: You should avoid direct indexing into a UTF-8 string, because it might split a multi-byte character. Instead, you can use a UTF-8 library to iterate over the string by Unicode code points or graphemes.

2. **Size (`std::string::size()`)**: This function returns the number of bytes, not the number of characters. If you need the number of Unicode code points or graphemes, you can use a UTF-8 library to count them.

3. **Searching (`std::string::find_first_of()`)**: This function works on bytes, so it might give incorrect results if the search string contains multi-byte characters. You can use a UTF-8 library to perform the search correctly.

4. **Regular expressions (`std::regex`)**: The standard C++ regular expression library doesn't support UTF-8 directly. You can use a third-party library that supports UTF-8, or you can convert the string to `std::wstring` and use `std::wregex`.

There are several libraries available that can help you handle UTF-8 strings correctly, such as ICU, Boost.Locale, and utfcpp.

Remember, `std::wstring` is not a solution for handling UTF-8, because the size of `wchar_t` is platform-dependent and might not be large enough to hold all Unicode characters. On Windows, `wchar_t` is 16 bits and used for UTF-16. On Unix-like systems, `wchar_t` is 32 bits and used for UTF-32. Neither is suitable for UTF-8.
