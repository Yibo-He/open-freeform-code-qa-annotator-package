I'm new in Rust and i'm trying to allocate computational work to threads.
I have vector of strings, i would want to create to each string one thread to do his job. There's simple code:
```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let mut strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in &mut strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(|| child_job(s)));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

I got errors while compile:
```
error[E0597]: `strings` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:18:14
   |
18 |     for s in &mut strings {
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |              |
   |              borrowed value does not live long enough
   |              argument requires that `strings` is borrowed for `'static`
...
31 | }
   | - `strings` dropped here while still borrowed

error[E0505]: cannot move out of `strings` because it is borrowed
  --> src/main.rs:28:14
   |
18 |     for s in &mut strings {
   |              ------------
   |              |
   |              borrow of `strings` occurs here
   |              argument requires that `strings` is borrowed for `'static`
...
28 |     for s in strings {
   |              ^^^^^^^ move out of `strings` occurs here
```

I can't understand what's wrong with lifetime of pointers and how i should fix that. For me it looks OK, because every thread get only one mutable pointer of string and doesn't affect the vector itself in any way.

The problem here is that Rust is very strict about ownership and borrowing. When you create a thread and pass it a reference to a string, Rust needs to make sure that the string will still be valid for the entire lifetime of the thread. This is why it requires a `'static` lifetime, which basically means "this will be valid for the entire duration of the program".

However, your `strings` vector is not `'static` - it's created in the `main` function and will be dropped when `main` returns. This is why you're getting the error "`strings` does not live long enough".

To fix this, you can use `Arc` and `Mutex` to share ownership of the strings between the threads. Here's how you can do it:

```rust
use std::thread;
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};

fn child_job(s: Arc<Mutex<String>>) {
    let mut s = s.lock().unwrap();
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        Arc::new(Mutex::new("hello".to_string())),
        Arc::new(Mutex::new("world".to_string())),
        Arc::new(Mutex::new("testing".to_string())),
        Arc::new(Mutex::new("good enough".to_string())),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in &strings {
        let s_clone = Arc::clone(s);
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(s_clone)));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in &strings {
        println!("{}", s.lock().unwrap());
    }
}
```

In this code, `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) is a type of smart pointer that allows multiple threads to have read access to the same data, and `Mutex` (Mutual Exclusion) is used to ensure that only one thread can write to the data at a time. The `Arc::clone` function is used to create a new reference to the same data, which can be passed to the thread. The `move` keyword is used to move ownership of the cloned `Arc` into the thread.

This code should work as expected, creating a new thread for each string and converting each string to uppercase.

The problem you're facing is due to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. When you create a new thread with `thread::spawn`, the closure you pass to it needs to have a `'static` lifetime. This means that all data it accesses must either be owned by the closure or live for the entire duration of the program.

In your case, you're trying to pass a reference to a string (`s`) to each thread. However, these references are not `'static` - they're tied to the lifetime of `strings`, which is not `'static`. This is why you're getting the error "`strings` does not live long enough".

One way to solve this problem is to pass the ownership of each string to the thread. You can do this by moving the strings into the threads. However, this means you can't use them in the main thread anymore after they've been moved. Here's how you can do this:

```rust
use std::thread;

fn child_job(mut s: String) -> String {
    s = s.to_uppercase();
    s
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(s)));
    }

    // wait for threads and collect results
    let mut results = Vec::new();
    for handle in thread_handles {
        let result = handle.join().unwrap();
        results.push(result);
    }

    // print result
    for s in results {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

In this code, `child_job` now takes ownership of a `String` and returns it after modifying it. The threads are created by moving each string into the closure, and the results are collected into a new vector after the threads have finished.

        results.push(result);
