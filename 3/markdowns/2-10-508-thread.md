According to [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/25877389/10116440), `#[allow(dead_code)]` should work, but it doesn't
```
fn main() {
    #[allow(dead_code)]
    let x = 0;
}
```

The correct is
```
fn main() {
    #[allow(unused_variables)]
    let x = 0;
}
```

These are different lints. `dead_code` refers to unused code at the item level, e.g. imports, functions and types. `unused_variables` refers to variables that are never accessed.
You can also cover both cases with `#[allow(unused)]`.

Put `#![allow(unused)]` at the top of the file (note the !).
