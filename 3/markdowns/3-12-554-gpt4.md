I have updated my flutter project from 1.26.3 to 2.1.0. Since then I am facing some issue. I am getting error as "Expected a value of type 'SkDeletable', but got one of type 'Null'".
Does anybody knows what is related with?

The error you're encountering is likely due to a null safety issue. Flutter 2.0 introduced null safety, which means that variables can't be null unless you explicitly allow them to be. This is a breaking change, and it can cause issues if your code or any packages you're using haven't been updated to handle null safety.

The error message "Expected a value of type 'SkDeletable', but got one of type 'Null'" suggests that somewhere in your code (or in a package you're using), a value of type 'SkDeletable' is expected, but a null value is being provided instead.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your code:** Look through your code to see if there are any places where you're providing a null value where a 'SkDeletable' is expected. If you find any, you'll need to update your code to ensure that a 'SkDeletable' is always provided.

2. **Check your packages:** If you're using any packages in your project, check to see if they've been updated to support null safety. If they haven't, you may need to find an alternative package that does support null safety, or you may need to fork the package and update it yourself.

3. **Migrate your code to null safety:** If you haven't already, you should migrate your code to null safety. This will help you catch and fix any potential null safety issues in your code. You can use the Dart migration tool to help with this.

4. **Check Flutter version:** Make sure you're using the correct Flutter version. Some packages may not be compatible with the latest version of Flutter. You can check the Flutter version by running `flutter --version` in your terminal.

5. **Clean and get packages:** Try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` in your terminal. This will clean your build and fetch the necessary packages again.

If none of these steps resolve your issue, you may need to provide more information or share your code so that someone can help you diagnose the problem.

The error you're encountering is likely due to a null safety issue. Flutter 2.0 and above have null safety enabled by default, which means that you need to ensure that all variables are initialized before they're used.

The error message "Expected a value of type 'SkDeletable', but got one of type 'Null'" suggests that you're trying to use a variable of type 'SkDeletable' that hasn't been initialized yet.

To fix this issue, you need to ensure that all variables are properly initialized before they're used. If a variable can be null, you should mark it as nullable by adding a '?' after the type name, like so: `SkDeletable?`.

If you're not sure where the error is coming from, you can try running the Dart analyzer, which can help you find potential null safety issues in your code. You can run the analyzer by opening the terminal in your IDE and typing `flutter analyze`.

If the error persists, it might be helpful to see the part of your code where you're encountering this issue.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error you're encountering is related to the Flutter engine. The 'SkDeletable' is a class in the Flutter engine, and it seems like it's expecting a non-null value but it's getting a null value instead.

This issue might be due to several reasons:

1. There might be some breaking changes in the Flutter upgrade that are affecting your code. Flutter 2.0 introduced null safety, which means you need to ensure all your variables are initialized before they're used.

2. There might be some packages in your project that are not yet compatible with Flutter 2.1.0. You should check the packages you're using and see if they have updates available that are compatible with Flutter 2.1.0.

3. There might be some issues with your Flutter installation. You could try to clean your project by running `flutter clean` in your terminal, and then rebuild your project.

4. If none of the above works, you might want to consider downgrading your Flutter version to the one you were using before, if the project was working fine with that version.

Remember to check the official Flutter upgrade guide to see if there are any steps you missed during the upgrade process.
