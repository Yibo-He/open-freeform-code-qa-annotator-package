What is MaterialStateProperty in ButtonStyle?
```
ThemeData(
  textButtonTheme: TextButtonThemeData(
    style: ButtonStyle(
      backgroundColor: , //?
    ),
  ),
),
```

The purpose of `MaterialStateProperty` is to make it possible to specify different styles for different states.
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/qYDk5.gif)
For example, if we want a button that's usually blue, but turns green when it's pressed, and enlarges its texts at the same time, we can use `MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith` to do exactly that.
```
ElevatedButton(
  style: ButtonStyle(
    backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith((states) {
      // If the button is pressed, return green, otherwise blue
      if (states.contains(MaterialState.pressed)) {
        return Colors.green;
      }
      return Colors.blue;
    }),
    textStyle: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith((states) {
      // If the button is pressed, return size 40, otherwise 20
      if (states.contains(MaterialState.pressed)) {
        return TextStyle(fontSize: 40);
      }
      return TextStyle(fontSize: 20);
    }),
  ),
  child: Text("Changing Button"),
  onPressed: () {},
)
```

In addition to checking whether the button is being "pressed", `MaterialStateProperty` also supports: disabled, dragged, error, focused, hovered, pressed, scrolledUnder, selected. Note that it's possible to have multiple states at once. For example, a button can be both "disabled" & "hovered" at the same time. With `MaterialStateProperty` you can customize its appearance when that happens.

The [Flutter API documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html#material.MaterialStateProperty.1) provides a nice clean pattern for resolving any of multiple states at one time.  For example, if you want to respond the same way to all interactive states you could define a method like this:
```
Color getColor(Set<MaterialState> states) {
      const Set<MaterialState> interactiveStates = <MaterialState>{
        MaterialState.pressed, // Any states you want to affect here
        MaterialState.hovered,
        MaterialState.focused,
      };
      if (states.any(interactiveStates.contains)) {
        // if any of the input states are found in our list
        return Colors.blue;
      }
      return Colors.red; // default color
    }
```

Then later in the button widget, simply assign that method as the resolver for the backgroundColor:
```
TextButton(
      style: ButtonStyle(
        backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith(getColor),
      ),
      onPressed: () {},
      child: const Text('Changing Button'),
    );
```

[Play with the full example in Dart Pad](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html#material.MaterialStateProperty.1).

Sure, it seems like you can use: `MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.red)` to make it red in all cases. But that's probably . For example, when the button is disabled, do you still want it to be red?

See, "all" means "all". This is not good.
So what, are we stuck dealing with `MaterialStateProperty` and checking for disabled states all day?
Thankfully, no. 
If you are using `ElevatedButton`, you can use `ElevatedButton.styleFrom` as a base style. Similarly, if you are using `TextButton`, you can use `TextButton.styleFrom`. From there, you can easily modify some of the styles.
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/DrxaY.png)
Code:
```
ElevatedButton(
  style: ElevatedButton.styleFrom(backgroundColor: Colors.red),
  child: Text("Red Button"),
  onPressed: () {},
)
```

That's it, you just pass in a `Color` class. Super easy, no `MaterialStateProperty` involved. And it automatically handles edge cases for you.

I am assuming that you want to know how to assign a color to the backgroundColor parameter of the ButtonStyle widget. If that is the case then just type something like this:
```
backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.green),
```

OR
```
backgroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.all(Color(0xFF5D5F6E)),
```

> Interface for classes that resolve to a value of type `T` based on a widget's interactive "state", which is defined as a set of MaterialStates.
Material state properties represent values that depend on a widget's material "state". The state is encoded as a set of `MaterialState` values, like `MaterialState.focused`, `MaterialState.hovered`, `MaterialState.pressed`. For example, the `InkWell.overlayColor` defines the color that fills the ink well when it's pressed (the "splash color"), focused, or hovered. The InkWell uses the overlay color's resolve method to compute the color for the ink well's current state.
`ButtonStyle`, which is used to configure the appearance of buttons like `TextButton`, `ElevatedButton`, and `OutlinedButton`, has many material state properties. The button widgets keep track of their current material state and resolve the button style's material state properties when their value is needed.

```
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  Color getColor(Set<MaterialState> states) {
    const Set<MaterialState> interactiveStates = <MaterialState>{
      MaterialState.pressed,
      MaterialState.hovered,
      MaterialState.focused,
    };
    if (states.any(interactiveStates.contains)) {
      return Colors.blue;
    }
    return Colors.red;
  }
  return TextButton(
    style: ButtonStyle(
      foregroundColor: MaterialStateProperty.resolveWith(getColor),
    ),
    onPressed: () {},
    child: Text('TextButton'),
  );
}
```


```
MaterialStateProperty.all(Colors.green) // Whatever value you want
```

To get more you can check official [documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html) of Material state properties made by the flutter team.

It is used to calculate the value depending on the current interactive state of the button, which can be hovered, pressed, focused,... ([full list here](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialState-class.html)).
If you want a fixed value, you can use `MaterialStateProperty.all(YOUR_VALUE)`, this value will be applied to all button states.
You can find more information here: [https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/MaterialStateProperty-class.html)
