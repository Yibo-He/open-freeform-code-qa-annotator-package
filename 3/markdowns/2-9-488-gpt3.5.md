I updated from ruby 2.7.1 to 3.1.1, then removed Gemfile.lock and ran `bundle update` (it's on a dev branch, so I can throw it away if this is a bad idea, I just wanted to see if it would work).
`bundle update` succeeds, but when I start the server:
```
rails s
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 7.0.2.2 application starting in development 
=> Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options

### What I've tried


Googling the 'psych' error message reveals [this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22664614/5783745) which may be related. But when I search the entire app for `YAML.safe_load` (or even just `safe_load`), there are 0 occurrences of it. (perhaps I should be searching actual gems in my app?).
It was a long shot but based on [this](https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/533#issuecomment-1034067033) comment, I [ran gem rdoc --all](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3917878/5783745) to update all rdoc documentation. But that didn't help.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message suggests that there is an issue with the YAML parser in your application. It seems that the `Psych` library is unable to find an alias named `default`. This could be due to a problem with the YAML file that you are trying to load.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your YAML files: Look for any syntax errors or missing aliases in your YAML files. Make sure that all aliases are defined correctly and that there are no typos.

2. Check your Gemfile: Make sure that all the gems in your Gemfile are compatible with Ruby 3.1.1. You can check the compatibility of each gem by looking at its documentation or by checking its GitHub repository.

3. Update your gems: Try updating all the gems in your Gemfile to their latest versions. You can do this by running `bundle update`.

4. Reinstall your gems: If updating your gems doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling them. You can do this by running `bundle install` and `bundle clean`.

5. Check your Rails configuration: Make sure that your Rails configuration is set up correctly. Check your `config/application.rb` file and make sure that all the necessary configurations are present.

6. Check your environment variables: Make sure that all your environment variables are set up correctly. Check your `.env` file and make sure that all the necessary variables are present.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to seek help from the Ruby community or consider rolling back to the previous version of Ruby that was working for you.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that there is an issue with the YAML parser in the `psych` gem. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Try running `bundle exec rails s` instead of `rails s`. This will ensure that you are using the correct version of Rails and its dependencies.

2. Check if any of the gems in your Gemfile have a dependency on an older version of the `psych` gem. You can do this by running `bundle show --dependencies | grep psych`. If you find any gems that depend on an older version of `psych`, try updating them to a version that is compatible with Ruby 3.1.1.

3. Try updating the `psych` gem to the latest version by running `bundle update psych`. This may fix any issues with the YAML parser.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try removing the `psych` gem from your Gemfile and using the built-in YAML parser in Ruby instead. To do this, remove the `psych` gem from your Gemfile and add the following line at the top of your `config/application.rb` file:

   ```ruby
   require 'yaml'
   ```

   This will ensure that Rails uses the built-in YAML parser instead of the `psych` gem. However, note that this may cause compatibility issues with other gems that depend on `psych`.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message suggests that there is an issue with the YAML parser in your application. It's possible that one of your gems is using YAML and causing this issue. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your Gemfile.lock to see if any of your gems are using YAML. You can search for "yaml" in the file to find any relevant entries.

2. Try running `bundle exec rails s` to ensure that you are using the correct version of Rails and its dependencies.

3. Try removing any gems that you recently added or updated to see if that resolves the issue.

4. Check the documentation for any gems that you are using to see if they have any known issues with YAML or the version of Ruby that you are using.

5. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you may want to try rolling back to the previous version of Ruby that you were using and see if the issue persists.
