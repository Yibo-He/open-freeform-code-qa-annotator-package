I can't wrap my head around using  for a single widget with provider? Suppose my widget is CurvedNavigationBar and I have 4 items in that widget. I also have 4 different classes that extend ChangeNotifier and 

? I looked at the documentation and could not found such an example.. is this even possible? I found that Consumer has a builder method, so that means you can build a widget  

Should I rather have a single class that extends ChangeNotifier and then update values in that widget and uses only a single Consumer to listen for updated values?

There are some other `Consumer` widgets. `Consumer2`, `Consumer3`, `Consumer4` till `Consumer6`. If you want to listen 4 ChangeNotifier you can use `Consumer4`

```
Consumer4(
  builder: (context, changeNotifier1, changeNotifier2, changeNotifier3, changeNotifier4, child) {
    // your widget
  }
)
```

Yes you can add up to 6 consumers and will be as following

```
Consumer2<AuthProvider, StorageProvider>(
    builder: (context, authProvider, storageProvider, child) {

    }
    )
```

There is another way to get access to your providers: `Provider.of<SomeProvider>(context)`:
```
Widget build(BuildContext context) {
  final authProvider = Provider.of<AuthProvider>(context);
  final apiProvider = Provider.of<ApiProvider>(context);
  final storageProvider = Provider.of<StorageProvider>(context);

  // Do your usual stuff without wrapping it into Consumer,
  // just pass providers directly to your targets.
  return MyAwesomeWidget(
    authProvider,
    apiProvider,
    storageProvider,
  );
}
```
