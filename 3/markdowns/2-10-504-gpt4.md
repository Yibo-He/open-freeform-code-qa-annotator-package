I want to remove duplicate elements from an array:
```
use itertools::Itertools;
use std::collections::HashSet;

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

fn main() {
    let arr = [
        Person { name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30 },
    ];

    // Way 1:
    let arr2 = {
        let names: Vec<_> = arr.iter().map(|v| v.name.clone()).unique().collect();
        names
            .iter()
            .map(|name| arr.iter().find(|person| &person.name == name).unwrap())
            .collect::<Vec<_>>()
    };
    dbg!(arr2);

    // Way 2:
    let arr2 = {
        let mut names = HashSet::new();
        arr.iter()
            .filter(|p| names.insert(p.name.clone()))
            .collect::<Vec<_>>()
    };
    dbg!(arr2);

    /*
    expect:
        [
            Person{name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10},
            Person{name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20},
            Person{name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30},
        ]
    */
}
```

Way 2 is simple compared to way 1, but is there anything simpler?

The two ways you've provided are already quite efficient. However, if you want to simplify it further, you can use the `dedup_by` method provided by Rust's `slice` type. This method removes consecutive duplicate elements of the slice in-place.

But, to use `dedup_by`, you need to sort your array first. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
use std::cmp::Ordering;

#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

impl Ord for Person {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Ordering {
        self.name.cmp(&other.name)
    }
}

impl PartialOrd for Person {
    fn partial_cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> Option<Ordering> {
        Some(self.cmp(other))
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut arr = vec![
        Person { name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30 },
    ];

    arr.sort();
    arr.dedup();

    dbg!(arr);
}
```

In this code, we first implement `Ord` and `PartialOrd` for `Person` so we can sort the array. Then we sort the array and call `dedup` to remove duplicate elements.

Please note that this will only remove consecutive duplicates, so it's important to sort the array first. Also, this will modify the array in-place, so if you need the original array, you should clone it before sorting and deduping.

The second way you've provided is already quite simple and efficient. It uses a `HashSet` to keep track of unique names and filters the original array based on whether the name has been seen before. This is a common and effective way to remove duplicates from a collection in many programming languages.

However, if you want to make it even simpler, you could use the `dedup_by` method provided by Rust's `Vec` type. This method removes consecutive duplicates in-place according to a predicate function. But note that this method only removes consecutive duplicates, so it requires the vector to be sorted first.

Here is how you could use it:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut arr = vec![
        Person { name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30 },
    ];

    arr.sort_by(|a, b| a.name.cmp(&b.name));
    arr.dedup_by(|a, b| a.name == b.name);

    dbg!(arr);
}
```

This code first sorts the vector by name, and then removes consecutive duplicates with the same name. Note that this modifies the original vector in-place. If you don't want to modify the original vector, you would need to clone it first.

Also note that this method only works if your `Person` struct implements the `PartialEq` and `PartialOrd` traits, which are required for the `==` operator and the `cmp` method, respectively. If your `Person` struct doesn't implement these traits, you'll need to add implementations for them.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Your current implementation is already quite efficient and idiomatic in Rust. However, if you want to simplify it further, you can use the `HashSet` directly with `Person` instead of just the name. This will work if you implement `Eq` and `Hash` for `Person`. 

Here is how you can do it:

```rust
use std::collections::HashSet;
use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}

impl PartialEq for Person {
    fn eq(&self, other: &Self) -> bool {
        self.name == other.name
    }
}

impl Eq for Person {}

impl Hash for Person {
    fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {
        self.name.hash(state);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let arr = [
        Person { name: "aaa".to_string(), age: 10 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "bbb".to_string(), age: 20 },
        Person { name: "ccc".to_string(), age: 30 },
    ];

    let arr2: HashSet<_> = arr.iter().collect();
    dbg!(arr2);
}
```

In this code, we implement `PartialEq`, `Eq`, and `Hash` for `Person` so that we can use it in a `HashSet`. We only use the `name` field for equality and hashing, so two `Person` instances with the same name are considered the same, regardless of their `age` field. This will give you a `HashSet` with unique `Person` instances. If you need a `Vec`, you can convert it using `arr2.into_iter().collect()`.

Please note that this solution assumes that two `Person` instances with the same name are considered the same. If this is not the case, you need to adjust the `PartialEq` and `Hash` implementations accordingly.
