I looked at this [Ruby installation (2.2.2) fails in macOS Big Sur](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65524323/ruby-installation-2-2-2-fails-in-macos-big-sur)
My macOS is Big Sur and the version I have is 11.2 and it was the closest I could find to the issue I'm having with my OS, I followed what I could by trying
```
CFLAGS="-Wno-error=implicit-function-declaration" rbenv install 2.5.3
```

and also
```
RUBY_CFLAGS=-DUSE_FFI_CLOSURE_ALLOC rbenv install 2.5.3
```

This is the output in my Terminal:

I get this error for both commands mentioned above and both give this same output.
The version of Ruby also doesn't seem to matter, I've tried 3.0.0 as well and get the same results.
Additionally this is the original output when I try to just install ruby with `rbenv install`

xcode-select version is 2384.
Homebrew version is 3.0.0 and `brew doctor` say's I'm ready to brew.
My .zshrc file also contains this line `eval "$(rbenv init -)"`
At this point I'm not sure where else to turn 
If there is any specifics you want to see in the log file let me know where from, the log file is too big to share here. Why is this happening and how can I fix this? ‍♂️

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of the required dependencies for Ruby. The error message suggests that some extensions are missing and the build is failing as a result.

One thing you can try is to install the missing dependencies manually using Homebrew. You can do this by running the following command:

```
brew install openssl readline zlib
```

After installing these dependencies, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv install`.

If that doesn't work, you can try updating your version of `ruby-build`, which is the tool that `rbenv` uses to install Ruby versions. You can do this by running the following command:

```
brew upgrade ruby-build
```

After upgrading `ruby-build`, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv install`.

If neither of these solutions work, you can try using a different version of Ruby or a different installation method. For example, you can try using `rvm` instead of `rbenv`, or you can try installing a different version of Ruby that is known to work on Big Sur.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like there might be an issue with the installation of some dependencies needed for Ruby. One thing you can try is to install the missing dependencies manually using Homebrew. 

First, make sure Homebrew is up to date by running `brew update`. Then, try installing the dependencies mentioned in the error message by running:

```
brew install openssl readline zlib libyaml
```

After that, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv install`. 

If that doesn't work, you can also try updating your version of rbenv by running `brew upgrade rbenv` and then trying the installation again. 

If you're still having issues, you can try looking at the log file mentioned in the error message (`/var/folders/rn/c7nmr3x12gg5r8qwsr4ty8hh0000gn/T/ruby-build.20210209143107.60561.log`) to see if there are any more specific error messages that might help diagnose the issue.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Based on the error message you provided, it seems that the installation failed due to missing dependencies. The log suggests that some required libraries such as `openssl`, `readline`, `zlib`, and `yaml` were not found.

To fix this issue, you can try installing these dependencies using Homebrew before installing Ruby. Here are the commands you can use:

```
brew install openssl readline zlib libyaml
```

After installing these dependencies, try installing Ruby again using `rbenv install`. This should resolve the issue.

If you still encounter errors, you can try updating your `rbenv` installation and Ruby-build plugin to the latest versions. You can do this using the following commands:

```
brew upgrade rbenv ruby-build
```

After upgrading, try installing Ruby again. If the issue persists, you can try using a different version of Ruby or a different installation method.
