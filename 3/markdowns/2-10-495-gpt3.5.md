I'm new in Rust and i'm trying to allocate computational work to threads.
I have vector of strings, i would want to create to each string one thread to do his job. There's simple code:
```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let mut strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in &mut strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(|| child_job(s)));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

I got errors while compile:
```
error[E0597]: `strings` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:18:14
   |
18 |     for s in &mut strings {
   |              ^^^^^^^^^^^^
   |              |
   |              borrowed value does not live long enough
   |              argument requires that `strings` is borrowed for `'static`
...
31 | }
   | - `strings` dropped here while still borrowed

error[E0505]: cannot move out of `strings` because it is borrowed
  --> src/main.rs:28:14
   |
18 |     for s in &mut strings {
   |              ------------
   |              |
   |              borrow of `strings` occurs here
   |              argument requires that `strings` is borrowed for `'static`
...
28 |     for s in strings {
   |              ^^^^^^^ move out of `strings` occurs here
```

I can't understand what's wrong with lifetime of pointers and how i should fix that. For me it looks OK, because every thread get only one mutable pointer of string and doesn't affect the vector itself in any way.

The issue with your code is that the threads you are creating are borrowing mutable references to the strings in the `strings` vector. However, the threads may outlive the vector, which would cause the references to become invalid. This is what the compiler is warning you about.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move ownership of the string into the thread closure. This way, the thread will own the string and there will be no lifetime issues. Here's the modified code:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s.clone())));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

In this code, we use `move` to move ownership of the string `s` into the thread closure. We also use `s.clone()` to create a new mutable reference to the string, which we pass to `child_job`. This way, each thread has its own copy of the string to work with, and there are no lifetime issues.

Note that we also removed the `&mut` from the `child_job` function signature, since we are now passing a mutable reference to the cloned string.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The issue with your code is that the threads you are creating are borrowing mutable references to the strings in the `strings` vector. However, the lifetime of these mutable references is tied to the lifetime of the `strings` vector, which is not `'static`. This means that the threads cannot outlive the `strings` vector, which is dropped at the end of the `main` function.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move the ownership of each string into the closure passed to `thread::spawn`. This way, each thread will own its own string and will not need to borrow it from the `strings` vector. Here's the modified code:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut s = s;
            child_job(&mut s);
            s
        }));
    }

    // wait for threads and collect results
    let results: Vec<_> = thread_handles.into_iter().map(|h| h.join().unwrap()).collect();

    // print result
    for s in results {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
```

In this version, we use `move` to move the ownership of each string into the closure passed to `thread::spawn`. We then create a mutable reference to the string inside the closure and pass it to `child_job`. Finally, we return the modified string from the closure and collect the results of all the threads into a new vector.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue with your code is that the closure passed to `thread::spawn` captures a reference to the `s` variable, which has a lifetime that is tied to the `strings` vector. However, the threads may outlive the `strings` vector, which would result in a dangling reference.

To fix this, you can use the `move` keyword to move the ownership of the string into the closure, like this:

```
for s in strings {
    thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s)));
}
```

Note that we need to pass a mutable reference to the `child_job` function, so we need to use `&mut s` instead of just `s`.

With this change, the closure takes ownership of the string and moves it into the thread, so there is no longer a lifetime issue.

Here's the full code with the fix:

```
use std::thread;

fn child_job(s: &mut String) {
    *s = s.to_uppercase();
}

fn main() {
    // initialize
    let mut thread_handles = vec![];
    let strings = vec![
        "hello".to_string(),
        "world".to_string(),
        "testing".to_string(),
        "good enough".to_string(),
    ];

    // create threads
    for s in strings {
        thread_handles.push(thread::spawn(move || child_job(&mut s)));
    }

    // wait for threads
    for handle in thread_handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    // print result
    for s in strings {
        println!("{}", s);
    }
}
``` 

I hope this helps!
