I am trying to install `gem install travis` to use `travis-cli` as per reference [https://rubygems.org/gems/travis](https://rubygems.org/gems/travis) but getting below error.
Tried solution mentioned here [https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/653](https://github.com/ffi/ffi/issues/653) :
```
brew reinstall libffi
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib"
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH="/usr/local/opt/libffi/lib/pkgconfig"
gem install travis
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like the issue is related to the missing `ruby/config.h` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install the Xcode command-line tools by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Install the `rbenv` package manager by running the following command:

   ```
   brew install rbenv
   ```

3. Install the Ruby version required by Travis by running the following command:

   ```
   rbenv install 2.3.1
   ```

4. Set the global Ruby version to 2.3.1 by running the following command:

   ```
   rbenv global 2.3.1
   ```

5. Install the `travis` gem by running the following command:

   ```
   gem install travis
   ```

6. Verify that the `travis` command is working by running the following command:

   ```
   travis version
   ```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue is related to the missing `ruby/config.h` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Install the Xcode command-line tools by running the following command in the terminal:
```
xcode-select --install
```

2. Install the `rbenv` package manager for Ruby by running the following command in the terminal:
```
brew install rbenv
```

3. Install the required version of Ruby by running the following command in the terminal:
```
rbenv install 2.3.0
```

4. Set the global version of Ruby to the installed version by running the following command in the terminal:
```
rbenv global 2.3.0
```

5. Install the `bundler` gem by running the following command in the terminal:
```
gem install bundler
```

6. Finally, install the `travis` gem by running the following command in the terminal:
```
gem install travis
```

These steps should resolve the issue and allow you to install the `travis` gem successfully.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the issue is related to the missing `ruby/config.h` file. You can try the following steps to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure you have Xcode and its command-line tools installed on your system. You can install them by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   xcode-select --install
   ```

2. Try installing the `ffi` gem separately by running the following command:

   ```
   gem install ffi
   ```

3. If the above step doesn't work, try installing the `ffi` gem with the `-- --with-system-ffi` option:

   ```
   gem install ffi -- --with-system-ffi
   ```

4. Once the `ffi` gem is installed, try installing the `travis` gem again:

   ```
   gem install travis
   ```

If the above steps don't work, you can try updating your Ruby version or reinstalling it. You can also try using a Ruby version manager like RVM or rbenv to manage your Ruby installations.
