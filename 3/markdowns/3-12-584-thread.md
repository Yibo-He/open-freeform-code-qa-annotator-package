When I run:

I'm getting a prompt on my mobile device asking if I want to install the app on my device. I give yes, then nothing happens!
It's stuck here:
```
Launching lib/main.dart on POCO F1 in debug mode...
Initializing gradle...                                           1.5s

I solved this by manually installing the apk file generated in the builds folder. After that running `flutter run` runs the app on my phone.

For me, the error was due to my work android profile. I uninstalled the debug app in personal profile but it remained in the work profile, once I uninstalled it there and ran flutter run. It worked without any issues.
So,
First, ensure you deleted the App in both personal and work profile
And then run
```
flutter run
```


### Update:


By profiles I meant, android user profiles on your phone.

I removed debug application from Android menu, and then I ran into the same issue. I restarted my phone, but it wasn't very helpful. My solution was to  by hand:


1. Connect to the device with ADB
2. Use adb uninstall com.example.application.name
3. Use adb install C:\PathToYourProject\build\app\outputs\apk\app.apk



By the way, in such uneasy scenarios, `flutter run --verbose` could provide more detailed information what went wrong.

Running `flutter clean` solved this issue for me using an emulator. 

I wiped the emulator data, deleted my emulator, and created a new one, none of that worked. `flutter clean` worked though.

If this problem persists in your physical device follow the below operation

Select the app from the apps list in settings
(You could see a "not installed for this user" sub along side it)

then 
`Top right menu button "uninstall for all users"`

Firstly i removed app with package name on command line. If you do not know package name you can check applicationId in app/build.gradle .

```
adb uninstall packagename
```


After then it works.

Very easy solution, just uninstall the app using below command even you did not found app on your device or emulator. This is because sometimes even you uninstall app from device from setting, that app still remains there for other users (Multi user feature in devices). So to completely remove the app from device, use below command and then try to install the app again (Restart the android studio to terminate process if it is already running) 

```
adb uninstall <package.name>
```


e.g.

```
adb uninstall com.example.myfirstflutterapp
```

I had a problem with this when I uninstalled my app from a device, but unfortunately, I didn't uninstall it from all the users that are on my phone. Even Guest kept a version of my app in it, so I solve this issue with uninstalling all version of my app for all users. After that my app was installed without a problem. Sadly we don't get any error message that something is not right if this happens, so I hope this was a case for you guys and that I help you solve it! ;)

Background: While the app was being installed by Android Studio, I manually deleted the app from the device. Thereafter I discovered that the app would not install.

This problem was resolved by going to Settings > Apps  and noting that the app was disabled rather than uninstalled even though I did confirm the uninstall request. In any case, I tapped the app and performed an uninstall from the Settings > Apps screen.

For anybody reading this, I solved this  by doing the following:


1. Open Android Studio->SDK Manager and install API 27 (By default Android Studio only installed the latest (API 28) as at the time of writing and there seem to be issues with using that right now).
2. In cmd run flutter doctor --android-licenses and make sure you accept all the licenses.
3. Open Android Studio->AVD Manager and create a new emulator using API 27
4. Run your app on the new emulator and enjoy!



Hope this helps :).

I also have this problem because I changed a file (my_project\android\app\src\main\java\com\example\my_project\MainActivity.java). and I solved it like this:

```
package com.example.my_project; //your project name should be changed here.

import android.os.Bundle;
import io.flutter.app.FlutterActivity;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;

public class MainActivity extends FlutterActivity {

I got this issue when I uninstalled the flutter app from homescreen. I could not get it installed through android studio or through flutter install commands. What worked for me was to generate the release apk.

`flutter build apk`

And put the apk in the device and install it again manually through the device. After which there was no issues with installing through both android studio or flutter commands.

For me, it was a package: `admob_flutter`

I'd compiled and updated dependencies but used wrong the package. I realize it by looking at the Log in 
`View -> Tool Windows -> Logcat (ALT+6)` in Android Studio.

Before the app running in AVD was crashing, but I didn't know why, not seen an error in the Run Terminal, but the Logcat helped me.

Hope it helps someone.

Lots of answers here!
The one that worked for me -
replace contents of your `<app>/android/gradle.properties` with the following -
```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
android.enableR8=true
```

If you don't want to enable R8
```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
#android.enableR8=true

Physical Device : I had the same issue when I uninstalled the app from app drawer.
As already answered, one way to fix this is using ADB to cleanly remove it from your phone, but if you don't have ADB installed, try :

1. Run flutter clean from the project root folder
2. Switch to the guest profile on your phone (You must have multiple users enabled, if not enable it in Settings by searching for 'users')
3. Delete the guest profile. (This can be done by swiping down the notification shade when you are in the guest profile --> clicking on the 'guest icon' next to the settings icon --> delete guest
4. run main.dart


Should be fixed

I use ADB to debug the app and sometimes it gets stuck on installing. I tried reinstalling VS Code and Flutter but found out the issue was with ADB.
So, whenever I face this issue I stop the ADB server by:
```
adb kill-server
```

and then connect to the device again and the issue is fixed.

If you have changed the app's package name and if you think you did eveything right.
Don't forget to change folder name under
```

This happened for me because there was a typo in gradle.properties. I assume it had something to do with the refactor tool in Android Studio. Two settings ended up on the same line like this:

I solved this issue but I would like mention few things.
 1. My Fresh Installation was stuck at Installing APK...
 2. Same issue on Device as well as in Emulator

I realized that this issue is not device-specific for me. that's why I started looking for solutions.

Solution I tried 
1. Flutter Upgrade ( Using Fresh Copy from Flutter.dev) 
Didn't Solve my Issue
2. Android SDK (Using Fresh Android SDK)
Didn't Solve my Issue

Luckily, I found an article that explained you need to keep a few directories out from realtime scanning.
I was using FREE-Antivirus 

I just tried to Uninstall that and Re-started my machine.

3. Cleaned up (using an utility app) (optional).
4. Searched manually by the app name and delete them on the file explorer.
5. Restart.
6. Verify developer options are unable correctly. (After enabling as a developer,) check following developer options are enabled: Developer options. USB debugging. Install via USB. USB debugging(Security settings). Select USB configuration: MTP(Media Transfer Protocol).


On the IDE:

1. Run flutter clean.
2. Restart the IDE (optional).
3. Plug the physical device and check the device is connected as debugging device.
4. Run flutter pub get and make sure no errors (optional).
5. Run in debug mode.

The simplest solution,  !! (must try before any complex processes)
In my case, I noticed the problem is with my emulator. Even without running any project, the emulator was stuck.  Hence same error occurred when I tried to run other projects also.
In case you are unable to do Cold boot for your AVD, follow below 2 steps and try again

1. Stop running your project(main.dart) and
2. delete the lock file at C:\Users\your_name.android\avd\Nexus_6P_API_30.avd\

First of all you need to check if any space shortage is happened in emulator / device.It may happens when you have shortage of space.
If everything is fine ,then do as follow:
```
flutter clean
```

This will clean deletes build-cache which is in the /build folder.
Then run,
```
flutter pub get
```

For me this helped to resolve this issue.Hope it will help you too
