My platform is a Mac. I'm a C++ beginner and working on a personal project which processes Chinese and English. UTF-8 is the preferred encoding for this project.
I read some posts on StackÂ Overflow, and many of them suggest using `std::string` when dealing with UTF-8 and avoid `wchar_t` as there's no `char8_t` right now for UTF-8.
However, none of them talk about how to properly deal with functions like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()` or `std::regex` as these function usually returns unexpected results when facing UTF-8.
Should I go ahead with `std::string` or switch to `std::wstring`? If I should stay with `std::string`, what's the best practice for one to handle the above problems?

It is true that `std::string` is a good choice for handling UTF-8 strings in C++. However, you need to be careful when using functions like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()` or `std::regex` as they may not work as expected with UTF-8 strings.

If you want to stick with `std::string`, you can use libraries like ICU or Boost.Locale to handle UTF-8 strings properly. These libraries provide functions that work with UTF-8 strings and can handle complex operations like normalization, collation, and regular expressions.

Alternatively, you can switch to `std::wstring` which is designed to work with wide characters and can handle UTF-8 strings properly. However, keep in mind that `std::wstring` may not be as efficient as `std::string` and may require more memory.

In summary, if you want to stick with `std::string`, use libraries like ICU or Boost.Locale to handle UTF-8 strings properly. If you want to switch to `std::wstring`, keep in mind that it may not be as efficient as `std::string` and may require more memory.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It is true that `std::string` is a good choice for handling UTF-8 strings in C++. However, you need to be careful when using functions like `str[i]`, `std::string::size()`, `std::string::find_first_of()` or `std::regex` as they may not work as expected with UTF-8 strings.

One way to handle these problems is to use a library that provides UTF-8 aware string functions. One such library is the ICU (International Components for Unicode) library. ICU provides a set of C++ classes and functions for working with Unicode strings, including UTF-8 strings.

If you decide to stick with `std::string`, you can use the following guidelines to avoid problems with UTF-8 strings:

1. Use `std::string::size()` instead of `strlen()` to get the length of a string. `strlen()` only works with null-terminated strings, which may not be the case with UTF-8 strings.

2. Use `std::string::at()` instead of `str[i]` to access individual characters in a string. `std::string::at()` performs bounds checking and throws an exception if the index is out of range.

3. Use `std::string::find()` instead of `std::string::find_first_of()` to search for a substring in a string. `std::string::find()` works with UTF-8 strings and returns the position of the first occurrence of the substring.

4. Use a library like Boost.Regex or ICU Regular Expressions instead of `std::regex` to work with regular expressions in UTF-8 strings.

If you decide to switch to `std::wstring`, keep in mind that `std::wstring` uses UTF-16 encoding on Windows and UCS-4 encoding on Unix-like systems. This may cause compatibility issues if you need to work with UTF-8 data from other sources.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It's true that `std::string` is a good choice for handling UTF-8 strings in C++. However, you need to be aware of some caveats when using it.

Firstly, `std::string` is a container of bytes, not characters. This means that `str[i]` will return the i-th byte of the string, not the i-th character. To properly handle UTF-8 strings, you need to use a library that can handle multi-byte characters, such as ICU or Boost.Locale.

Secondly, `std::string::size()` returns the number of bytes in the string, not the number of characters. To get the number of characters in the string, you need to use a library that can handle multi-byte characters.

Thirdly, `std::string::find_first_of()` and `std::regex` may not work as expected when dealing with UTF-8 strings. Again, you need to use a library that can handle multi-byte characters.

If you want to avoid these issues, you can use `std::wstring` instead of `std::string`. `std::wstring` is a container of wide characters, which can handle UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. However, you need to be aware that `std::wstring` may not be as efficient as `std::string` when dealing with UTF-8 strings.

In summary, if you want to use `std::string` for handling UTF-8 strings, you need to use a library that can handle multi-byte characters and be aware of the caveats mentioned above. If you want to avoid these issues, you can use `std::wstring` instead.
