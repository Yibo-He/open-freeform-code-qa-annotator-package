I have a single even-sized vector that I want to transform into a vector of pairs where each pair contains always two elements. I know that I can do this using simple loops but I was wondering if there is a nice standard-library tool for this? It can be assumed that the original vector always contains an even amount of elements.
Example:
```
vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

vector<pair<int, int>> goal { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
```

There isn't a direct standard-library tool in C++ to transform a vector into a vector of pairs. However, you can achieve this using the `std::transform` function from the `<algorithm>` library in combination with an iterator. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility> // for std::pair
#include <algorithm> // for std::transform
#include <iterator> // for std::distance, std::begin, std::end

int main() {
    std::vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> goal;

    // Ensure the origin vector has an even number of elements
    if (origin.size() % 2 != 0) {
        throw std::invalid_argument("The origin vector must have an even number of elements.");
    }

    // Resize the goal vector to half the size of the origin vector
    goal.resize(origin.size() / 2);

    // Use std::transform to populate the goal vector
    std::transform(std::begin(origin), std::end(origin), std::begin(goal),
        [&origin](int& n) {
            // Calculate the index of n in the origin vector
            int index = std::distance(std::begin(origin), &n);

            // Return a pair of consecutive elements from the origin vector
            return std::make_pair(origin[index], origin[index + 1]);
        }
    );

    return 0;
}
```

This code uses a lambda function with `std::transform` to create a pair of consecutive elements from the `origin` vector and store them in the `goal` vector. The `std::distance` function is used to calculate the index of the current element in the `origin` vector. 

Please note that this code assumes that the `origin` vector always contains an even number of elements. If this is not the case, the code will throw an `std::invalid_argument` exception.

In C++, you can use the `std::transform` function from the `<algorithm>` library to achieve this. Here is an example:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <algorithm>
#include <iterator>

std::vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> goal;

std::transform(origin.begin(), origin.end(), std::back_inserter(goal),
    [&origin](const int &n) {
        static int i = -1;
        return std::make_pair(origin[++i], origin[++i]);
    });
```

In this code, `std::transform` applies a lambda function to each element in the `origin` vector. The lambda function uses a static variable `i` to keep track of the current index. For each call, it increments `i` twice and returns a pair of the current and next element.

Please note that this code assumes that the `origin` vector always contains an even number of elements, as you mentioned. If the number of elements can be odd, you should add a check to prevent out-of-bounds access.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

There isn't a direct standard-library tool to transform a vector into a vector of pairs. However, you can achieve this using a combination of standard-library tools in a concise way. Here's an example using iterators and the `std::pair` constructor:

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <utility>

std::vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> goal;

for (auto it = origin.begin(); it != origin.end(); std::advance(it, 2)) {
    goal.emplace_back(*it, *(it + 1));
}
```

In this code, we create an iterator `it` that goes through the `origin` vector. We advance this iterator by 2 in each iteration of the loop, and use the `emplace_back` function to add a pair of the current and next elements to the `goal` vector.

This code assumes that the `origin` vector always contains an even number of elements, as you mentioned. If there's a chance it might not, you should add error checking to prevent out-of-bounds access.
