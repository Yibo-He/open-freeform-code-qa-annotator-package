I'm trying (for hours now) to install the cargo crate `diesel_cli` for postgres. However, every time I run the [recommended](https://diesel.rs/guides/getting-started/) cargo command:
```
cargo install diesel_cli --no-default-features --features postgres
```

I wait a few minutes just to see the same build fail with this message:
```
note: LINK : fatal error LNK1181: cannot open input file 'libpq.lib'

error: aborting due to previous error
error: failed to compile `diesel_cli v1.4.1`, intermediate artifacts can be found at `C:\Users\<user name here>\AppData\Local\Temp\cargo-installUU2DtT`

Caused by:
  could not compile `diesel_cli`.
```

I'm running postgres in a docker container and have the binaries on my `C:\pgsql` with the `lib` and `bin` directories both on the `PATH` so I can't figure out why it's not linking. What else could be required they didn't mention in the docs?

The answer below is a work around for older versions. Please check the possibility to execute `cargo clean` first

Adding the folder to the `PATH` variable didn't help, at least in my case, as by some reason it is not used in the `/LIBPATH` parameter passed to `link.exe`.
In my case it was `C:\Users\<username>\.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib`
You can see it in the beginning of the error message.
Copy `libpq.lib` in there and it will be used from there.
After installation diesel would require some other assemblies. Copy `libcrypto-1_1-x64.dll`, `libiconv-2.dll` and `libssl-1_1-x64.dll` into the folder showed after `where diesel` command execution

In my case the installation was successful but when I tried to run it this error occured.
maybe this would work for others who have the same problem:
- - `setx PQ_LIB_DIR "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\13\lib"`- - 
I had the same issue with WSL, if you're on Linux probably you could find PostgreSQL lib location and add it to your environment variables.

I had the same error on Ubuntu and for me the following install fixed the issue:
```
sudo apt install libpq-dev
```

No need to move files around, just add `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\lib` and `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin` to your PATH. Installing and running diesel should have no problems.

(Tested on Windows 10)

To give clear steps for windows:

1. Add C:\Users<username>.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib in the path in environment variables
2. Copy libpq.lib that is in C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\lib (obviously this is with version 14) and paste it in C:\Users<username>.rustup\toolchains\stable-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib\rustlib\x86_64-pc-windows-msvc\lib

If you've attempted to cargo build (or anything that runs the build scripts for libpq rust crate) when your environment was invalid, then you need to do a `cargo clean` after fixing your environment otherwise you'll still get the libpq.lib not found error even when it's in your PATH. The other answers where you copy the file into another directory are just hacks

You can instead add the path to `.../lib` to the compilers' library search paths, using [RUSTFLAGS environment variable](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/environment-variables.html). It works both for installing `diesel_cli` and for building your projects.
```
RUSTFLAGS='-L /usr/local/pgsql/lib' cargo build
```

On Windows with EDB installer, the path contains a space, so use `CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS` instead. For PowerShell:
```
$env:CARGO_ENCODED_RUSTFLAGS = "-L`u{1f}C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\lib"
```
