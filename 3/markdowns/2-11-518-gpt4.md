The rule of 5 states that if a class has a user-declared destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor, then it must have the other 4.
But today it dawned on me: when do you ever need a user-defined destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor?
In my understanding, implicit constructors / destructors work just fine for aggregate data structures. However, classes which manage a resource need user-defined constructors / destructors.
However, can't all resource managing classes be converted into an aggregate data structure using a smart pointer?
Example:
```
// RAII Class which allocates memory on the heap.
class ResourceManager {
    Resource* resource;
    ResourceManager() {resource = new Resource;}
    // In this class you need all the destructors/ copy ctor/ move ctor etc...
    // I haven't written them as they are trivial to implement
};
```

vs
```
class ResourceManager {
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> resource;
};
```

Now example 2 behaves exactly the same as example 1, but all the implicit constructors work.
Of course, you can't copy `ResourceManager`, but if you want a different behavior, you can use a different smart pointer.
The point is that you don't need user-defined constructors when smart pointers already have those so implicit constructors work.
The only reason I would see to have user-defined constructors would be when:

1. you can't use smart pointers in some low-level code (I highly doubt this is ever the case).
2. you are implementing the smart pointers themselves.


However, in normal code I don't see any reason to use user-defined constructors.
Am I missing something here?

You're correct in your understanding that smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined destructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, move constructors, and move assignment operators. This is because smart pointers, like `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr`, handle their own memory management, which can greatly simplify code and reduce the risk of memory leaks.

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions yourself:

1. **Performance considerations**: While smart pointers are great for managing resources, they do introduce a slight overhead compared to raw pointers. In performance-critical code, this overhead might be unacceptable.

2. **Custom behavior**: Sometimes, the default behavior provided by the compiler-generated special member functions or those of smart pointers isn't what you want. For example, you might want to deep copy some members and shallow copy others, or you might want to log every time an object is copied or moved.

3. **Managing non-memory resources**: Smart pointers are designed to manage memory. If your class manages other types of resources (like a file, a network connection, a database transaction, etc.), you'll need to define your own destructor and possibly copy/move constructors and assignment operators to manage these resources correctly.

4. **Compatibility with C-style code**: If you're interfacing with C-style code, you might not be able to use smart pointers, as they're a C++ feature.

5. **Legacy code**: If you're working with legacy code that doesn't use smart pointers, you might need to define these special member functions to ensure correct behavior.

So while smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined special member functions, there are still cases where you might need to define them yourself.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You're correct that smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined destructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, move constructors, and move assignment operators. They are a great tool for managing resources and can simplify code significantly.

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions yourself:

1. **Performance considerations**: Smart pointers do add a level of indirection and can have performance implications. In performance-critical code, you might want to manage resources manually.

2. **Custom behavior**: If you need to perform some custom action when copying, assigning, or destroying objects, you'll need to define these functions yourself. For example, you might want to log when an object is destroyed, or implement some sort of copy-on-write behavior.

3. **Managing non-memory resources**: Smart pointers are great for managing memory, but there are other resources that might need management as well. For example, you might have a class that opens a file or a network connection. In these cases, you'll need a destructor to close the file or connection when the object is destroyed, and you'll likely want to disable copying and provide a move constructor and move assignment operator.

4. **Legacy code and APIs**: If you're working with older code or APIs that don't use smart pointers, you might need to manage resources manually.

5. **Ownership semantics**: Unique ownership (std::unique_ptr) and shared ownership (std::shared_ptr) might not fit the ownership semantics of your use case. In such cases, you might need to implement your own resource management code.

So while smart pointers can often simplify code and eliminate the need for these special member functions, there are still cases where you might need to define them yourself.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You are correct in your understanding that smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined destructors, copy constructors, copy assignment operators, move constructors, and move assignment operators. Smart pointers are designed to manage resources, such as dynamically allocated memory, and automatically clean up when they are no longer needed. This can greatly simplify code and prevent common errors, such as memory leaks or double deletion.

However, there are still cases where you might need to define these special member functions:

1. **Performance considerations**: While smart pointers are very useful, they do have some overhead compared to raw pointers. In performance-critical code, it might be necessary to manage resources manually to get the best possible performance.

2. **Custom resource management**: Sometimes, you might need to manage resources in a way that is not supported by the standard smart pointers. For example, you might need to interface with a C library that requires resources to be allocated and deallocated in a specific way.

3. **Ownership semantics**: The standard smart pointers express specific ownership semantics. `std::unique_ptr` expresses exclusive ownership, while `std::shared_ptr` expresses shared ownership. If you need different ownership semantics, you might need to define your own resource management code.

4. **Legacy code**: If you are working with legacy code that does not use smart pointers, you might need to define these special member functions to ensure correct behavior.

5. **Non-memory resources**: Smart pointers are designed for memory management, but there are other resources that might need management as well, such as file handles, network sockets, database connections, etc. For these, you might need to define your own resource management code.

So while smart pointers can often eliminate the need for user-defined special member functions, there are still cases where they might be necessary. It's also worth noting that even when using smart pointers, you might still want to define these functions to control copy/move behavior, or to do additional cleanup.
