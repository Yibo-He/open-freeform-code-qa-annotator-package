I updated from ruby 2.7.1 to 3.1.1, then removed Gemfile.lock and ran `bundle update` (it's on a dev branch, so I can throw it away if this is a bad idea, I just wanted to see if it would work).
`bundle update` succeeds, but when I start the server:
```
rails s
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 7.0.2.2 application starting in development 
=> Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options

### What I've tried


Googling the 'psych' error message reveals [this](https://stackoverflow.com/q/22664614/5783745) which may be related. But when I search the entire app for `YAML.safe_load` (or even just `safe_load`), there are 0 occurrences of it. (perhaps I should be searching actual gems in my app?).
It was a long shot but based on [this](https://github.com/ruby/psych/issues/533#issuecomment-1034067033) comment, I [ran gem rdoc --all](https://stackoverflow.com/a/3917878/5783745) to update all rdoc documentation. But that didn't help.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message you're seeing is related to the Psych library, which is a YAML parser and emitter. The error is being triggered when the library encounters an alias (default) that it doesn't recognize.

The error seems to be originating from the `webpacker` gem, as indicated by these lines in your stack trace:

```
from /Users/st/.rbenv/versions/3.1.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.0/gems/webpacker-4.3.0/lib/webpacker/env.rb:30:in `available_environments'
from /Users/st/.rbenv/versions/3.1.1/lib/ruby/gems/3.1.0/gems/webpacker-4.3.0/lib/webpacker/env.rb:21:in `current'
```

It appears that `webpacker` is trying to load some YAML configuration files and is encountering an issue with an alias.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your YAML files**: Look for any YAML files in your project that may be loaded by `webpacker`. This could be a `webpacker.yml` file or any other YAML files in your project. Check these files for any aliases (indicated by `&` and `*` in YAML) and make sure they are defined correctly.

2. **Update `webpacker`**: You're currently using `webpacker` version 4.3.0. There may be a compatibility issue with Ruby 3.1.1. Try updating `webpacker` to the latest version by running `bundle update webpacker`.

3. **Check your environment variables**: `webpacker` is trying to load the available environments. Make sure your environment variables are set correctly, especially any that are used by `webpacker`.

4. **Create a new Rails project**: If you're still having issues, try creating a new Rails project with Ruby 3.1.1 and see if you encounter the same issue. This can help you determine if the issue is specific to your current project or if it's a more general issue with Ruby 3.1.1 and `webpacker`.

Remember to always backup your project before making any major changes.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is related to the YAML parser in Ruby (Psych) encountering an alias (default) that it doesn't recognize. This is usually due to a malformed YAML file in your application.

The error stack trace indicates that the error is occurring when webpacker is trying to load its environment configuration. This suggests that the issue might be in one of your webpacker configuration files, possibly `config/webpacker.yml`.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. Check your `config/webpacker.yml` file for any syntax errors or unexpected aliases. You can use an online YAML validator to help with this.

2. Try to temporarily remove the `config/webpacker.yml` file (or rename it) and see if the error persists. If the error disappears, it's a strong indication that this file is the source of the problem.

3. If the error persists, try to search for YAML files in your project and check them for syntax errors. You can use the `find` command in your terminal to do this:

   ```bash
   find . -name '*.yml'
   ```

4. If none of the above steps help, the issue might be in one of your gems. Try to update your gems one by one to see if the error disappears. Start with webpacker since the error seems to originate from it.

5. If the error still persists, try to create a new Rails application with the same Ruby and Rails versions and see if you can reproduce the error. If you can't, the issue is likely in your application's code or configuration. If you can, the issue might be in Rails or one of its dependencies, and you should consider reporting it.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error you're encountering is related to the Psych library, which is a YAML parser and emitter. The error message `Unknown alias: default (Psych::BadAlias)` suggests that there's an issue with an alias in one of your YAML files.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check your YAML files for syntax errors:** Make sure all your YAML files are properly formatted. You can use an online YAML validator to check for syntax errors.

2. **Search for the alias 'default':** The error message suggests that there's an issue with an alias named 'default'. Search your YAML files for the usage of this alias. It might be that this alias is not defined before it's used.

3. **Update your gems:** The error might be caused by an outdated gem. Try updating all your gems by running `bundle update`.

4. **Check your environment variables:** If you're using environment variables in your YAML files, make sure they're all set correctly.

5. **Downgrade Ruby version:** If none of the above solutions work, you might consider downgrading your Ruby version. It's possible that the version you're using has some incompatibilities with your current setup.

Remember to always backup your work before making any major changes to your environment.
