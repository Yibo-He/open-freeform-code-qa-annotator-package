I'm wading through a codebase full of code like this:
```
if let Some(i) = func1() {
    if let Some(j) = func2(i) {
        if let Some(k) = func3(j) {
            if let Some(result) = func4(k) {
                // Do something with result
            } else {
                println!("func 4 returned None");
            }
        } else {
            println!("func 3 returned None");
        }
    } else {
        println!("func 2 returned None");
    }
} else {
    println!("func 1 returned None");
}
```

That's a stupid, simplified example, but the general pattern is that:
- `Option`- `None`- `Some`- `None``None`
The problem, of course, is that the above code is an ugly and unreadable. It gets even uglier when you substitute `i`, `func1` etc. with variable/function names that actually mean something in the real code, and many examples in my real codebase have far more than four nested `if let`s. It's an example of the [arrow anti-pattern](http://wiki.c2.com/?ArrowAntiPattern), it completely fails the [squint test](https://atom.io/packages/squint-test), and it's confusing how the error messages appear in reverse order to the functions which can cause them.
Is there really not a better way to do this? I want to refactor the above into something that has a cleaner, flatter structure where everything appears in a sensible order. [if let chaining](https://rust-lang.github.io/rfcs/2497-if-let-chains.html) might help but it doesn't look like that feature is available in Rust yet. I thought maybe I could clean things up by using `?` and/or extracting some helper functions, but I couldn't get it to work and I'd rather not extract a ton of new functions all over the place if I can avoid it.
Here's the best I could come up with:
```
let i : u64;
let j : u64;
let k : u64;
let result : u64;

if let Some(_i) = func1() {
    i = _i;
} else {
   println!("func 1 returned None");
   return;
}
if let Some(_j) = func2(i) {
    j = _j;
} else {
   println!("func 2 returned None");
   return;
}
if let Some(_k) = func3(j) {
    k = _k;
} else {
   println!("func 3 returned None");
   return;
}
if let Some(_result) = func3(k) {
    result = _result;
} else {
   println!("func 4 returned None");
   return;
}


// Do something with result
```

But this still feels very long and verbose, and I don't like how I'm introducing these extra variables `_i`, `_j` etc.
Is there something I'm not seeing here? What's the simplest and cleanest way to write what I want to write?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You're right that the nested `if let` statements can be hard to read and maintain. One way to simplify the code is to use the `?` operator, which is shorthand for the `match` statement that checks for `Some` and returns the value or `None` and returns early. Here's an example of how you can use it:

```
let i = func1()?;
let j = func2(i)?;
let k = func3(j)?;
let result = func4(k)?;

// Do something with result
```

This code does the same thing as your original code, but it's much shorter and easier to read. The `?` operator will return early if any of the functions return `None`, so you don't need to worry about nested `if let` statements.

Note that you need to add a `?` after each function call that returns an `Option`. If you're not familiar with the `?` operator, you can read more about it in the [Rust book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch09-02-recoverable-errors-with-result.html#shortcuts-for-panic-on-error-unwrap-and-expect).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

One way to simplify this code is to use the `map()` and `and_then()` methods on `Option`. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code using these methods:

```
let result = func1()
    .and_then(func2)
    .and_then(func3)
    .and_then(func4);

if let Some(result) = result {
    // Do something with result
} else {
    println!("One of the functions returned None");
}
```

This code is much shorter and easier to read than the original code. It uses the `and_then()` method to chain the functions together, and the `map()` method to extract the final result from the `Option` type. If any of the functions return `None`, the code will print an error message.

Note that you can also use the `?` operator to achieve a similar result, but you would need to define a custom error type that implements the `From` trait for each of the `Option` types. This can be more complex than using the `map()` and `and_then()` methods, so I would recommend sticking with the `map()` and `and_then()` approach unless you have a specific reason to use the `?` operator.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

One way to simplify this code is to use the `map()` and `and_then()` methods on `Option`. Here's an example of how you could refactor your code using these methods:
```
let result = func1()
    .and_then(func2)
    .and_then(func3)
    .and_then(func4);

if let Some(result) = result {
    // Do something with result
} else {
    println!("One of the functions returned None");
}
```

This code is much shorter and easier to read. The `and_then()` method is used to chain the functions together, and the `map()` method is used to extract the result from the final `Option`. If any of the functions return `None`, the `and_then()` chain is short-circuited and the final result is `None`.

Note that you can also use the `?` operator to achieve a similar result, but you would need to define a custom error type that implements the `From` trait for `Option`. Here's an example:
```
enum MyError {
    Func1ReturnedNone,
    Func2ReturnedNone,
    Func3ReturnedNone,
    Func4ReturnedNone,
}

impl From<Option<()>> for MyError {
    fn from(option: Option<()>) -> Self {
        match option {
            Some(_) => panic!("Unexpected Some"),
            None => MyError::Func1ReturnedNone,
        }
    }
}

impl From<(u64, Option<()>)> for MyError {
    fn from(tuple: (u64, Option<()>)) -> Self {
        match tuple {
            (_, Some(_)) => panic!("Unexpected Some"),
            (i, None) => MyError::Func2ReturnedNone,
        }
    }
}

impl From<(u64, u64, Option<()>)> for MyError {
    fn from(tuple: (u64, u64, Option<()>)) -> Self {
        match tuple {
            (_, _, Some(_)) => panic!("Unexpected Some"),
            (i, j, None) => MyError::Func3ReturnedNone,
        }
    }
}

impl From<(u64, u64, u64, Option<u64>)> for MyError {
    fn from(tuple: (u64, u64, u64, Option<u64>)) -> Self {
        match tuple {
            (_, _, _, Some(_)) => panic!("Unexpected Some"),
            (i, j, k, None) => MyError::Func4ReturnedNone,
        }
    }
}

fn func_chain() -> Result<u64, MyError> {
    let i = func1().ok_or(MyError::Func1ReturnedNone)?;
    let j = func2(i).ok_or((i, MyError::Func2ReturnedNone))?;
    let k = func3(j).ok_or((i, j, MyError::Func3ReturnedNone))?;
    let result = func4(k).ok_or((i, j, k, MyError::Func4ReturnedNone))?;
    Ok(result)
}

let result = func_chain()?;

// Do something with result
```

This code is more concise than the original code, but it requires more boilerplate to define the custom error type and the `From` trait implementations.
