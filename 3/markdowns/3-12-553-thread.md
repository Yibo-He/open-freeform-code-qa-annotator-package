I developed an app in flutter with Visual Studio code on Mac. I ran the application without any kind of problem on IOS. I also installed it on a physical device and it works perfectly, but I have a problem generating the Android project study and its APK on with flutter.

: 

```
flutter build appbundle

Gradle build failed to produce an .aab file. It's likely that this file was generated under

this because your project is missing gradle.prperties file >> open terminal in android studio or vs code and write "flutter create ." it will create missing file one of them is gradle.properties.

in my own case my gradle.properties was missing. I Just created a new gradle.properties file  inside the android folder, with the below parameter
```
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx1536M
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
android.enableR8=true
```

you should go to 

YourAppName=> android => gradle.properties

inside gradle.properties add these two lines 

```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```


dat should solve it.

I had an old project using Firestore, that I was trying to open, and got this message. I could not find any easy way to fix it.

These were the steps I took to migrate it, hope it helps someone.

Create a new folder.

Then run this command in Terminal, in the folder: 

```
flutter create --org com.yourdomain your_app_name
```


Copy the files from lib folder, (and any other modifications from android or ios folders).

Copy google-services.json to android\app folder.

Modify pubspec.yaml and copy the dependencies under dependencies:

Change android\app\build.gradle change version to:

```
minSdkVersion 21
```


Add the plugins needed in android\app\build.gradle:

```
apply plugin: 'com.google.gms.google-services'
```


In Android\build.gradle file:
Add the dependency (with your version):

```
classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
```

You need to convert your project to AndroidX. Execute the following command:
```
flutter create --androidx -t <project-type> <new-project-path>

Note: This Problem can also come while building an app downloaded from github, in VSCode with Flutter.

its 

if you are not using `android studio` as i am using `vscode`.
add below lines to 
```
android.useAndroidX=true
android.enableJetifier=true
```

Google introduced android jetpack(another topic) in which `AndroidX` package name and namespace default for jetpack libraries and minimum `support library 28` required what i guess now flutter team wants to migrate `flutter` support to `android jetpack` near future. come to  point now  migrating to `androidx` make sure your project has `support library 28`
add below lines to .
```
android {
    compileSdkVersion 28
// other lines of code
}
```


i had same issue when i cloned my old [flutter repo](https://github.com/iammohsinar/flutterfacebookcloneprofile.git)
if you have cloned `flutter legacy app` repo from github and your development flutter SDK version is `2.2.x` first you need to migrate your app to [NULL Safety](https://dart.dev/null-safety/migration-guide) after you should migrate to `androidx` follow my
