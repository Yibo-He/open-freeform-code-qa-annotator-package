I am developing a Flutter app for academic purposes in university. Now, I need to run a sort of "always on" background service in order to use Bluetooth and most importantly to get periodic updates from external REST APIs.

I've already checked those two libraries from pub.dev ([this](https://pub.dev/packages/foreground_service) and [this](https://pub.dev/packages/background_fetch)) without finding the perfect solution that works out-of-the-box (as expected...). I also saw something native with Kotlin ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXuAzXY_KOo)). What I would to know is what is the best option in order to achieve my goals (in terms of best practices, completeness and with simplicity in mind).

Have a look at the following image for a more schematic view:

Running background tasks in Flutter is a bit tricky due to the nature of the Dart runtime. When a Flutter app goes to the background, the Dart runtime usually suspends execution until the app is brought back to the foreground. This is why you're having trouble finding a solution that works out-of-the-box.

However, there are a few ways you can achieve this:

1. **WorkManager for Android and BackgroundTasks for iOS**: These are native solutions for running background tasks in Android and iOS respectively. You can write native code in Kotlin/Swift and use platform channels to communicate with your Flutter code. This is the most reliable way to run background tasks as these APIs are designed to work with the operating system's background execution limits. However, this requires knowledge of native programming and is more complex.

2. **Flutter Background Service Plugin**: This plugin allows you to run Dart code in the background. It's a simpler solution than writing native code, but it's not as reliable as the native solutions. There are also some limitations to what you can do in the background Dart code.

3. **Flutter Foreground Service Plugin**: This plugin allows you to run a foreground service in Android. A foreground service is a service that the user is actively aware of and is not subject to the same background execution limits as regular background services. This is a good solution if you need to run tasks that require user awareness, such as a music player. However, it's Android only and not suitable for tasks that should run without user awareness.

4. **Flutter Isolate**: Dart's version of threads. You can run long-running tasks in an isolate. However, isolates don't share memory and communication between them is based on message passing. Also, isolates are paused when the app is not in the foreground.

In your case, since you need to run a sort of "always on" background service, I would recommend using the native solutions (WorkManager for Android and BackgroundTasks for iOS) despite the complexity. This is because they are the most reliable and are designed to work with the operating system's background execution limits. You can use platform channels to communicate between your native code and Flutter code.

If you want to stick with Flutter, you can try the Flutter Background Service Plugin or the Flutter Foreground Service Plugin, but keep in mind the limitations and reliability issues.

Running background tasks in Flutter can be a bit challenging because of the restrictions imposed by both Android and iOS to save battery life and optimize performance. However, there are several ways to achieve this.

1. **WorkManager for Android**: This is a recommended way to schedule deferrable, asynchronous tasks that are expected to run even if the app exits or the device restarts. It's not Flutter, but native Android. You can write the background task in Kotlin or Java and then call it from Flutter using platform channels.

2. **Isolate in Flutter**: Dart's `Isolate` allows you to run code in a separate thread. It's a good choice for CPU-intensive operations like parsing a big JSON, doing complex computations, etc. But it's not suitable for tasks that need to run indefinitely in the background.

3. **flutter_background_service**: This package allows you to run Dart code in the background, even when the app is closed. It's a good choice for tasks that need to run indefinitely, like listening for incoming Bluetooth connections or fetching data from a REST API periodically.

4. **background_fetch**: This package allows your Flutter app to periodically fetch data in the background, similar to what you're looking for. However, it's limited by the Android and iOS task scheduler. On Android, it uses the JobScheduler API, and on iOS, it uses the Background Fetch API. Both of these APIs have limitations and don't guarantee that your task will run at an exact time.

5. **foreground_service**: This package allows your Flutter app to run a foreground service, which is a service that the user is aware of and is not subject to the same restrictions as a background service. It's a good choice for tasks that need to run indefinitely and require user awareness, like a music player.

In your case, I would recommend using a combination of `flutter_background_service` for the "always on" background service and `background_fetch` for periodic updates from REST APIs. You can also consider using `foreground_service` if you want the user to be aware of the service.

Remember that running tasks in the background can consume a lot of battery, so it's important to optimize your tasks to be as efficient as possible. Also, keep in mind that Android and iOS have different restrictions for background tasks, so you might need to adjust your implementation for each platform.

Running background tasks in Flutter can be a bit tricky due to the nature of the Dart runtime. When a Flutter app goes into the background, the Dart runtime usually suspends execution until the app is brought back to the foreground. This is not ideal for tasks that need to run in the background, like fetching data from an API or interacting with Bluetooth.

There are a few options to handle background tasks in Flutter:

1. **WorkManager for Android and BackgroundTasks for iOS**: These are native solutions for running background tasks. You can use platform channels to communicate between your Flutter code and the native code. This is a bit more complex as it requires knowledge of both Kotlin/Swift and Dart.

2. **flutter_background_service**: This is a Flutter package that allows you to run Dart code in the background, even when the app is closed. It's easier to use than the native solutions, but it may not be as flexible or powerful.

3. **Isolate**: Dart's way of creating a new thread. It's a bit more complex to use, but it allows you to run Dart code in the background. However, it doesn't work when the app is closed.

4. **flutter_local_notifications + android_alarm_manager**: This combination allows you to schedule tasks that run in the background, even when the app is closed. It's a bit more complex to set up, but it's a powerful solution.

In your case, since you need to run tasks even when the app is closed, I would recommend looking into the flutter_background_service package or the combination of flutter_local_notifications and android_alarm_manager. These solutions allow you to run Dart code in the background, which is easier to manage than writing native code.

Remember, running background tasks can consume a lot of battery, so it's important to be mindful of how often you're running these tasks and how much work they're doing.
