I am trying to import images to use inside a React component with TypeScript. The bundler I'm using is Parcel (not Webpack).

I have created a `.d.ts` file inside the project with the image file extension, and included it inside `tsconfig.json`. However, when I try to import an image, TS yells at me about `Cannot find module`.

My project structure:

```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.d.ts
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```


I tried to import the image in `App.tsx` like this. VS Code underlined  `'../assets/image.jpg'` and said `Cannot find module '../assets/image.jpg'`.

```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```


The discussions I found online point to the need of defining a `.d.ts` file myself, so I created that `index.d.ts` file with this line.

```
declare module '*.jpg';
```


Then added `"include": ["./src/index.d.ts"]` inside `tsconfig.json`, after `"compilerOptions" : {...}`.

What did I miss? How can I fix the error TS is throwing?

The issue you're facing is likely due to the way you're trying to import the image. In TypeScript, when you use `import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg'`, it's trying to import all exported members from the module, which is not applicable for an image file.

Instead, you should use the default import syntax:

```tsx
import img from '../assets/image.jpg';
```

Then, you can use the imported image in your component like this:

```tsx
const Box = props => {
  return <img src={img} alt="description" />;
}
```

Also, make sure that your `tsconfig.json` file includes the directory where your `index.d.ts` file is located. If the `index.d.ts` file is in the `src` directory, your `tsconfig.json` file should look something like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

This tells TypeScript to include all TypeScript files (`.ts`, `.tsx`) and TypeScript declaration files (`.d.ts`) in the `src` directory.

If you've done all of these and the issue still persists, try restarting your TypeScript server in VS Code. Sometimes, the server doesn't pick up changes in the `tsconfig.json` or declaration files until it's restarted. You can do this by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), then typing "TypeScript: Restart TS server".

The issue you're facing is likely due to the way you're trying to import the image. When you're using Parcel, you can import an image directly as a string which will contain the final path to the image after being processed by Parcel.

Here's how you should import the image:

```tsx
import * as React from 'react';
import img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

In the above code, `img` is a string that contains the path to the image.

Also, make sure your `index.d.ts` file is in the correct location and is properly included in your `tsconfig.json`. The `index.d.ts` file should be in the root of your `src` directory, and your `tsconfig.json` should look like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // other options...
    "typeRoots" : ["./src/index.d.ts"]
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

In the above `tsconfig.json`, `"typeRoots" : ["./src/index.d.ts"]` is replaced with `"typeRoots" : ["./node_modules/@types", "./src/index.d.ts"]` to include the default TypeScript type definitions.

If you're still facing issues, try restarting your TypeScript server in VS Code. Sometimes, the server might not pick up changes to the `tsconfig.json` or `index.d.ts` files until it's restarted. You can do this by opening the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P or Cmd+Shift+P), and running the "TypeScript: Restart TS server" command.

The error you're encountering is because TypeScript doesn't know how to handle non-code assets like images. When you import an image, TypeScript tries to find a module that matches the image file, but it can't find one, hence the error.

Your approach to solve this is correct, you need to declare a module for jpg files in a `.d.ts` file. However, the issue might be with the location of your `index.d.ts` file and how you've included it in your `tsconfig.json`.

The `index.d.ts` file should be in the root of your `src` directory, not in the root of your project. So your project structure should look like this:

```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.d.ts
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```

And your `index.d.ts` file should look like this:

```typescript
declare module '*.jpg' {
  const value: any;
  export default value;
}
```

Then, in your `tsconfig.json` file, you should include the `src` directory like this:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  },
  "include": ["src"]
}
```

This tells TypeScript to include all `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the `src` directory, as well as all `.d.ts` files.

Now you should be able to import your image in your `App.tsx` file like this:

```typescript
import * as React from 'react';
import img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```

This will import the image as a string containing the URL of the image, which you can then use in your React component.
