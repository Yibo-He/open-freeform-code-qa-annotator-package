I have updated my flutter project from 1.26.3 to 2.1.0. Since then I am facing some issue. I am getting error as "Expected a value of type 'SkDeletable', but got one of type 'Null'".
Does anybody knows what is related with?

It got resolved after I did `"flutter pub upgrade"`.
All dependency errors got resolved after upgrading pub.

I got the same error with the following code snippet:
```
BackdropFilter(
        filter: ImageFilter.blur(
        
          sigmaX: animation.value * 5.0),
          sigmaY: animation.value * 5.0),
        ),
        child: Container(
          color: Colors.transparent,
        ),
      ),
```

The error gets thrown because the animation goes from 0 to 1. More precisely, the ImageFilter does not work with values equal to zero.
A quick work-around is something like:
```
max(0.001, animation.value * 5.0)
```

so no zero value is passed to the Filter.

If you run your project in release or profile the error probably won't exist:
```
flutter run -d chrome --profile
flutter run -d chrome --release
```

At the same time if you get your --debug app and open it in Safari (for example) the error won't exist (most probably). It seems like an issue with Chrome (again).

It is most likely related to flushbar lib you might be using, try to use another_flushbar, as it has this problem solved and has the same api.
