I have updated my flutter project from 1.26.3 to 2.1.0. Since then I am facing some issue. I am getting error as "Expected a value of type 'SkDeletable', but got one of type 'Null'".
Does anybody knows what is related with?

This error message usually occurs when you are trying to access a variable or object that is null. In your case, it seems like you are trying to access an object of type 'SkDeletable' that is null.

To fix this issue, you need to identify the variable or object that is null and initialize it properly before accessing it. You can use null safety features introduced in Flutter 2.0 to avoid such issues in the future.

You can also try running your code with the Dart DevTools debugger to identify the exact line of code that is causing the error. This will help you to debug the issue more efficiently.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

This error message usually occurs when you are trying to use a variable or object that has not been initialized or is null. 

To resolve this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check if you have declared and initialized all the variables and objects that you are using in your code.

2. Make sure that you are not passing null values to any function or method.

3. Check if you are using any deprecated or outdated packages in your project. If yes, update them to the latest version.

4. Try to run your code with the --no-sound-null-safety flag to see if it resolves the issue. 

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try to debug your code and see where the null value is coming from.

I hope this helps you to resolve the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

This error message suggests that you are trying to use a variable or object that is null, but the code expects it to be of type 'SkDeletable'. This could be caused by a number of things, such as a null value being passed to a function that expects a non-null value, or a variable not being initialized properly.

To fix this issue, you should check the code where the error is occurring and make sure that any variables or objects that are being used are properly initialized and not null. You can also use null safety features introduced in Flutter 2.0 to avoid null errors. You can use the null-aware operator (?.) to safely access properties or methods of an object that might be null.
