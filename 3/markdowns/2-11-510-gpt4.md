I have checked a lot of issues about the link of filesystem under c++17 and I still cannot make the link successfully. My `main.cpp` file is as the following.

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>


int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


My `CMakeLists.txt` is as the following. 

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)

project(visual_hull LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_library(dataIO
        STATIC
            dataIO.hpp
            dataIO.cpp)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)

target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS})

add_executable(visual_hull main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(visual_hull PUBLIC dataIO
                                         stdc++fs)
```


The error is as the following.

```

The error message indicates that the namespace `std::filesystem` is not being recognized. This is because you are including `<experimental/filesystem>` but trying to use `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`. 

The filesystem library was experimental in C++14 and became officially part of the standard library in C++17. However, some compilers may still have it under the experimental directory even when using C++17.

If you are using a compiler that still has the filesystem library under the experimental directory, you should use `std::experimental::filesystem::directory_iterator` instead of `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`.

Here is the corrected code:

```cpp
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Also, you should link against `stdc++fs` in your CMakeLists.txt file. You have already done this, but make sure that your compiler supports this. If you are using GCC, version 8.0 or later is required.

If you are using a newer compiler that supports `std::filesystem`, you should include `<filesystem>` and use `std::filesystem::directory_iterator` instead. In this case, you don't need to link against `stdc++fs`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is indicating that the namespace `std::filesystem` is not declared. This is because you're including `<experimental/filesystem>` but trying to use `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`.

Since you're using C++17, you should be able to use `std::filesystem` instead of `std::experimental::filesystem`. 

Change your `#include` statement and the usage of `std::filesystem` in your `main.cpp` file:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Also, you need to link against the filesystem library in your `CMakeLists.txt` file. In C++17, the filesystem library is no longer experimental and is part of the standard library. However, in some compilers (like GCC), it's a separate library that needs to be linked against. 

You're already doing this with `stdc++fs`, but you need to make sure that your compiler actually supports this. If you're using GCC, you need at least version 8.1. If you're using an older version, you might need to upgrade your compiler or use `std::experimental::filesystem` instead.

If you're using GCC 8.1 or later and still having issues, you might need to add `stdc++fs` to the `target_link_libraries` for your `dataIO` library as well:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS} stdc++fs)
```

If you're using a different compiler, the way to link against the filesystem library might be different. For example, in Visual Studio 2017 and later, you don't need to link against a separate library for filesystem.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is indicating that the namespace `std::filesystem` is not declared. This is because you're including the experimental version of the filesystem library, but you're trying to use the finalized C++17 version of the library in your code.

In your `main.cpp` file, you have included `<experimental/filesystem>`, but you're trying to use `std::filesystem::directory_iterator`. The `std::filesystem` namespace is not available under `<experimental/filesystem>`. 

If you want to use the experimental filesystem library, you should change `std::filesystem::directory_iterator` to `std::experimental::filesystem::directory_iterator`.

Here is the corrected `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include <experimental/filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

However, if you want to use the C++17 version of the filesystem library, you should include `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`. 

Here is the corrected `main.cpp` for C++17:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>

namespace fs = std::filesystem;

int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: fs::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

Also, make sure your compiler supports C++17 and the filesystem library. If you're using GCC, version 8 or later is required. If you're using Clang, version 7 or later is required. If you're using Microsoft Visual Studio, version 2017 or later is required.
