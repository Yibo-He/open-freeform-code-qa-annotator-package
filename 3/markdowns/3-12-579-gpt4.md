I want to show alert dialog based on a condition. Not based on user interaction such as button press event.

If a flag is set in app state data alert dialog is shown otherwise its not.

Below is the sample alert dialog which I want to show

```
void _showDialog() {
    // flutter defined function
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        // return object of type Dialog
        return AlertDialog(
          title: new Text("Alert Dialog title"),
          content: new Text("Alert Dialog body"),
          actions: <Widget>[
            // usually buttons at the bottom of the dialog
            new FlatButton(
              child: new Text("Close"),
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }
```


I tried to call that method inside main screen widget's build method but it gives me error -

```
The context used to push or pop routes from the Navigator must be that of a widget that is a descendant of a Navigator widget.
E/flutter ( 3667): #0      Navigator.of.<anonymous closure> (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:1179:9)
E/flutter ( 3667): #1      Navigator.of (package:flutter/src/widgets/navigator.dart:1186:6)
E/flutter ( 3667): #2      showDialog (package:flutter/src/material/dialog.dart:642:20)
```


Problem is I don't know from where I should call that _showDialog method?

The error you're seeing is because the `context` you're using in `showDialog` doesn't have a `Navigator` in its widget tree. The `Navigator` is typically provided by the `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` widget at the root of your widget tree.

You should call your `_showDialog` method from a place where the `context` has a `Navigator` in its widget tree. This is typically inside the `build` method of a widget that is a child of the `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` widget.

However, you can't call `_showDialog` directly in the `build` method because it would be called every time the widget rebuilds, which is not what you want.

Instead, you should use a `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to call `_showDialog` after the widget has been built:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    if (flag) { // replace flag with your condition
      _showDialog();
    }
  });
}
```

This will ensure that the dialog is shown only once after the widget is built, and only if your condition is true.

Remember to replace `flag` with your actual condition. This flag can be a value in your app state that you check to decide whether to show the dialog or not.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is telling you that the context you're using to call `showDialog` is not a descendant of a `Navigator` widget. This is because the `BuildContext` represents a handle to the location of a widget in the widget tree. The `BuildContext` argument to the `build` method is the context of the `Widget` that is returned by the `build` method.

In Flutter, you cannot show a dialog in the `build` method directly because at the time the `build` method is processed, the widget is not yet fully integrated into the widget tree, hence it doesn't have any `Navigator` in its context yet.

To solve this, you can use `WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback` to add a callback that is called after the current frame has been dispatched. Here is an example:

```dart
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  WidgetsBinding.instance.addPostFrameCallback((_) {
    if (flag) { // replace flag with your condition
      _showDialog();
    }
  });
}
```

This way, the dialog will be shown after the widget is built and the flag condition is met. Make sure to replace `flag` with your actual condition.

Also, remember to call `super.initState();` at the beginning of your `initState` method to correctly initialize the state.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is because you're trying to show a dialog before the `Navigator` is available in the widget tree. The `Navigator` is used for routing and is created by the `MaterialApp` or `CupertinoApp` widget.

To show a dialog based on a condition, you can use a `Future.delayed` in the `initState` method of your widget. This will ensure that the widget is built before the dialog is shown.

Here's an example:

```dart
class MyApp extends StatefulWidget {
  @override
  _MyAppState createState() => _MyAppState();
}

class _MyAppState extends State<MyApp> {
  bool showDialogFlag = true; // your condition flag

  @override
  void initState() {
    super.initState();
    if (showDialogFlag) {
      Future.delayed(Duration.zero, () => _showDialog());
    }
  }

  void _showDialog() {
    showDialog(
      context: context,
      builder: (BuildContext context) {
        return AlertDialog(
          title: new Text("Alert Dialog title"),
          content: new Text("Alert Dialog body"),
          actions: <Widget>[
            new FlatButton(
              child: new Text("Close"),
              onPressed: () {
                Navigator.of(context).pop();
              },
            ),
          ],
        );
      },
    );
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      home: Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: Text('My App'),
        ),
        body: Center(
          child: Text('Hello World'),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, the `showDialogFlag` is the condition that determines whether the dialog should be shown. If it's `true`, the dialog will be shown as soon as the widget is built. If it's `false`, the dialog will not be shown. You can replace `showDialogFlag` with your actual condition.
