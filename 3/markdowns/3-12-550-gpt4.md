I was creating a flutter project, but I want to run my AVD in the android studio window itself, I already select the option in "Settings-> Tools-> Emulator" and check the option that says "Launch in a tool windows" but it still executes me regardless of the emulator.

I've already done several unsuccessful searches, does anyone have any ideas?

Create a project in normal java and there if that window appears I think it is a problem in flutter or something similar.

The problem you're facing might be due to the Flutter plugin in Android Studio. There are a few things you can try to solve this issue:

1. **Update Flutter and Dart plugins**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio. You can check this by going to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`.

2. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure your Android Studio is up-to-date. You can check for updates by going to `Help -> Check for Updates`.

3. **Reinstall Flutter plugin**: If updating doesn't help, try reinstalling the Flutter plugin. Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`, uninstall the Flutter plugin, restart Android Studio, and then reinstall the plugin.

4. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` in the terminal to see if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. If there are, follow the instructions provided to fix them.

5. **Create a new AVD**: Sometimes, the problem might be with the AVD itself. Try creating a new AVD and see if the problem persists.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug with the Flutter plugin or Android Studio. In that case, you might want to report the issue on the Flutter GitHub page.

The issue you're facing might be due to the version of the Android Studio or Flutter plugin you're using. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure you are using the latest stable version of Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Help -> Check for Updates...` in Android Studio.

2. **Update Flutter and Dart Plugins**: Ensure that your Flutter and Dart plugins are up-to-date. You can check this by going to `File -> Settings -> Plugins` in Android Studio.

3. **Update Flutter SDK**: Make sure your Flutter SDK is up-to-date. You can update Flutter SDK by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal.

4. **Reinstall Emulator**: Try to delete and reinstall the Android Emulator. You can do this by going to `Tools -> AVD Manager`, delete the current AVD and create a new one.

5. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, simply restarting Android Studio can solve the issue. 

If none of the above solutions work, it might be a bug with the Flutter plugin or Android Studio. In this case, you can report the issue to the Flutter team on their GitHub page.

It seems like you've done the correct steps to run the AVD in the Android Studio window itself. However, if it's not working as expected, it could be due to a bug or some other issues. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, changes in settings don't take effect until you restart Android Studio. Close the IDE and start it again.

2. **Update Android Studio**: Make sure you're using the latest version of Android Studio. If not, update it. Some older versions might have bugs that have been fixed in newer versions.

3. **Recreate AVD**: Try to delete the current AVD and create a new one. There might be some issues with the current AVD.

4. **Check Flutter and Dart Plugins**: Make sure you have installed and updated Flutter and Dart plugins in Android Studio.

5. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above steps work, you might want to consider reinstalling Android Studio. There might be some issues with the current installation.

Remember to back up your projects before updating or reinstalling Android Studio.
