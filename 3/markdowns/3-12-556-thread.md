guys! I am facing this camera version. It happened after I merged my projects. It says there is no camera available but back then it was running fine. Please have a look!

If your `compileSdkVersion` and `targetSdkVersion` is 30 (or above), then add the queries info to your Android manifest file, directly under the manifest tag:
```
<manifest package="your.app.package.name">
    <queries>
          <intent>
               <action android:name="android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE" />
          </intent>
    </queries>
</manifest>
```

That should resolve your issue.

I'm not sure adding `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` is the correct solution given the goal is to access the camera only. If `targetSdkVersion=30` (or higher), adding `<queries>` to your `AndroidManifest.xml` looks to be a preferable solution as per here - [https://stackoverflow.com/a/63246789/268156](https://stackoverflow.com/a/63246789/268156)
```
<manifest package="com.example">
    <queries>
        <intent>
            <action android:name="android.media.action.IMAGE_CAPTURE" />
        </intent>
    </queries>
    ...
</manifest>
```

I face same issue. For android, you need to add Camera permission and Query all packages permission in AndroidManifest.xml file as below:
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES"/>
```

If you are targeting android 11/ android sdk 30 or above, you need to add the following permission to android manifest xml file.
`<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES"/>`
It may throw another warning, but you can just ignore it for the time being. Regards.

I was testing on `Emulator`, when I switched to `Real device`, everything was working fine.
