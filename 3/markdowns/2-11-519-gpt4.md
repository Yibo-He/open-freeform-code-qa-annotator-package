I coded in  on  (Windows 10) and got this error:
```
#error The <experimental/filesystem> header providing std::experimental::filesystem is deprecated by Microsoft \
and will be REMOVED. It is superseded by the C++17 <filesystem> header providing std::filesystem. \
You can define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING to acknowledge that you have received this warning.
```

With this headers:
```
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <windows.h>
#include <filesystem>//If I will disable it nothing happens.

#include <experimental/filesystem> //If I will disable it happens another error.
namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem; 

using namespace std;
```

I've tried: `#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` in the main cpp file. It didnt help.
So then I paste this code from [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53365538/how-to-determine-whether-to-use-filesystem-or-experimental-filesystem):
```
#ifdef __cpp_lib_filesystem
    #include <filesystem>
    using fs = std::filesystem;
#elif __cpp_lib_experimental_filesystem
    #include <experimental/filesystem>
    using fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
#else
    #error "no filesystem support ='("
#endif
```

Didn't helped too.
What is the easiest way to get out that error?

The error message you're seeing is because the `<experimental/filesystem>` header is deprecated in C++17 and has been replaced by `<filesystem>`. 

You can try the following steps to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure your compiler supports C++17 and you have enabled it. If you're using GCC, you can enable C++17 by adding `-std=c++17` to your compiler flags. If you're using Visual Studio, you can set the C++ language standard to C++17 in the project properties.

2. Replace `#include <experimental/filesystem>` with `#include <filesystem>` in your code.

3. Replace `namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;` with `namespace fs = std::filesystem;` in your code.

4. If you're using Visual Studio, you might need to link against the filesystem library. You can do this by adding `stdc++fs` to your linker flags.

If you're still having issues after trying these steps, please provide more information about your development environment and the exact error message you're seeing.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is indicating that the `<experimental/filesystem>` header is deprecated and you should use the `<filesystem>` header instead. However, the `<filesystem>` header is only available in C++17 or later.

Here are a few steps you can take to resolve this issue:

1. Make sure you are compiling your code with C++17 or later. If you are using a compiler like g++ or clang, you can enable C++17 by adding `-std=c++17` to your compiler flags. If you are using Visual Studio, you can set the C++ language standard to C++17 in the project properties.

2. Replace the `<experimental/filesystem>` include with `<filesystem>`, and replace `std::experimental::filesystem` with `std::filesystem` in your namespace alias:

```cpp
#include <filesystem>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
```

3. If you still need to support older compilers that don't have `<filesystem>`, you can use an `#ifdef` check to include the right header and namespace alias:

```cpp
#if __has_include(<filesystem>)
    #include <filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::filesystem;
#elif __has_include(<experimental/filesystem>)
    #include <experimental/filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
#else
    #error "No filesystem support"
#endif
```

This will include `<filesystem>` and use `std::filesystem` if they are available, and fall back to `<experimental/filesystem>` and `std::experimental::filesystem` otherwise.

4. If you are still getting the deprecation warning after these steps, you can define `_SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` before including the header:

```cpp
#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING
#include <experimental/filesystem>
```

This will silence the deprecation warning, but it's generally better to update your code to use the non-deprecated features if possible.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is because the `<experimental/filesystem>` header has been deprecated in C++17 and replaced with `<filesystem>`. 

The `#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` should be placed before the `#include <experimental/filesystem>` line to silence the warning.

However, if you're using C++17 or later, you should switch to using `<filesystem>` instead of `<experimental/filesystem>`. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
#include <string>
#include <windows.h>

// Check if we're using C++17 or later
#if __cplusplus >= 201703L
    #include <filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::filesystem;
#else
    #define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING
    #include <experimental/filesystem>
    namespace fs = std::experimental::filesystem;
#endif

using namespace std;
```

This code will use `<filesystem>` if you're using C++17 or later, and `<experimental/filesystem>` otherwise. The `#define _SILENCE_EXPERIMENTAL_FILESYSTEM_DEPRECATION_WARNING` line will silence the deprecation warning for `<experimental/filesystem>`.

If you're still seeing errors, it's possible that your compiler doesn't fully support C++17 yet. In that case, you might need to update your compiler, or switch to a different one that has full C++17 support.
