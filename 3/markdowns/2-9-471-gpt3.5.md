I am trying to import images to use inside a React component with TypeScript. The bundler I'm using is Parcel (not Webpack).

I have created a `.d.ts` file inside the project with the image file extension, and included it inside `tsconfig.json`. However, when I try to import an image, TS yells at me about `Cannot find module`.

My project structure:

```
+ src
  + assets
    - image.jpg
  + components
    - Box.tsx
    - App.tsx
  - index.d.ts
  - index.html
  - index.tsx
- tsconfig.json
- tslint.json
```


I tried to import the image in `App.tsx` like this. VS Code underlined  `'../assets/image.jpg'` and said `Cannot find module '../assets/image.jpg'`.

```
import * as React from 'react';
import * as img from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  // do things...
}

export default Box;
```


The discussions I found online point to the need of defining a `.d.ts` file myself, so I created that `index.d.ts` file with this line.

```
declare module '*.jpg';
```


Then added `"include": ["./src/index.d.ts"]` inside `tsconfig.json`, after `"compilerOptions" : {...}`.

What did I miss? How can I fix the error TS is throwing?

It looks like you're on the right track with creating the `.d.ts` file and including it in `tsconfig.json`. However, you also need to tell Parcel how to handle image imports.

You can do this by installing the `parcel-plugin-static-files-copy` package and adding a `.parcelrc` file to the root of your project with the following content:

```
{
  "extends": "@parcel/config-default",
  "plugins": {
    "parcel-plugin-static-files-copy": {
      "staticPath": "src/assets"
    }
  }
}
```

This tells Parcel to copy the files in the `src/assets` directory to the output directory when building the project.

Then, in your component, you can import the image like this:

```
import * as React from 'react';
import image from '../assets/image.jpg';

const Box = props => {
  return <img src={image} alt="My Image" />;
}

export default Box;
```

Note that you don't need to use the `* as` syntax when importing the image. Also, make sure to use the `src` attribute to display the image in your component.

With these changes, TypeScript should no longer complain about the missing module.
