I am writing a TCP client and have a `conn` field in my client struct. My client implements two methods `new` to instantiate the struct and connect to open a connection to the server and set that as the value of the `conn` field
```
pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: TcpStream,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            // conn: <some-defaullt-value>,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self, ip: &str, port: &str) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = c,
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

I want to set the `conn` field in the new method to some default value. In Go I can do something like `conn: nil` but it doesn't work here. I tried `Default::default()` too but that trait isn't implemented for `TCPStream` how should I set it to a default value?

You can set the `conn` field to `None` using an `Option<TcpStream>` instead of `TcpStream`. Here's how you can modify your code to use `Option<TcpStream>`:

```
pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = Some(c),
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

Now, the `conn` field is initialized to `None` in the `new` method. When you call the `connect` method, it will set the `conn` field to `Some(TcpStream)` if the connection is successful. You can then use `if let Some(conn) = &self.conn` to check if the connection is established before using it.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use an `Option<TcpStream>` to represent the `conn` field and set it to `None` as the default value. Here's how you can modify your code to use `Option<TcpStream>`:

```
pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = Some(c),
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

Now, the `conn` field is an `Option<TcpStream>` and is set to `None` by default. In the `connect` method, you can set the `conn` field to `Some(c)` if the connection is successful. You can also remove the `ip` and `port` parameters from the `connect` method since the address is already stored in the `addr` field.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use an `Option<TcpStream>` instead of a `TcpStream` directly, and set the initial value to `None`. This way, you can set the value of `conn` to `Some(TcpStream)` when you establish a connection, or leave it as `None` if you haven't established a connection yet. Here's an updated version of your code:

```
pub struct FistClient {
    addr: String,
    conn: Option<TcpStream>,
}

impl FistClient {
    pub fn new(ip: &str, port: &str) -> Self {
        FistClient {
            addr: String::from(ip) + ":" + &String::from(port),
            conn: None,
        }
    }

    pub fn connect(&mut self) {
        let res = TcpStream::connect(&self.addr);
        match res {
            Ok(c) => self.conn = Some(c),
            Err(_) => panic!(),
        }
    }
}
```

Note that you don't need to pass the `ip` and `port` parameters to the `connect` method, since you've already stored them in the `addr` field.
