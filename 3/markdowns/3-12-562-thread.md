I saw that in dart there is a class Duration but it cant be used add/subtract years or month. How did you managed this issue, I need to subtract 6 months from an date. Is there something like moment.js for dart or something around?
Thank you

Okay so you can do that in two steps, taken from [@zoechi](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51420607/9714920) (a big contributor to Flutter):

Define the base time, let us say:

```
var date = new DateTime(2018, 1, 13);
```


Now, you want the new date:

```
var newDate = new DateTime(date.year, date.month - 1, date.day);
```


And you will get

```
2017-12-13
```

You can use the `subtract` and `add` methods

```
date1.subtract(Duration(days: 7, hours: 3, minutes: 43, seconds: 56)); 

 date1.add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 23)));
```


Flutter Docs:

[Subtract](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime/subtract.html)

[Add](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime/add.html)

Try out this package, [Jiffy](https://pub.dev/packages/jiffy#-readme-tab-). Adds and subtracts date time with respect to how many days there are in a month and also leap years. It follows the simple syntax of [momentjs](https://momentjs.com)
You can add and subtract using the following units
`years, months, weeks, days, hours, minutes, seconds and milliseconds`
To add 6 months
```
DateTime d = Jiffy().add(months: 6).dateTime; // 2020-04-26 10:05:57.469367
// You can also add you own Datetime object
DateTime d = Jiffy(DateTime(2018, 1, 13)).add(months: 6).dateTime; // 2018-07-13 00:00:00.000
```

You can also do chaining using dart method cascading
```
var jiffy = Jiffy().add(months: 5, years: 1);

DateTime d = jiffy.dateTime; // 2021-03-26 10:07:10.316874
// you can also format with ease
String s = jiffy.format("yyyy, MMM"); // 2021, Mar
// or default formats
String s = jiffy.yMMMMEEEEdjm; // Friday, March 26, 2021 10:08 AM
```

You can use `subtract` and `add` methods

[Subtract](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime/subtract.html)

[Add](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/dart-core/DateTime/add.html)

But you have to reassign the result to the variable, which means:

This wouldn't work

```
date1.add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 23)));
```


But this will:

```
date1 = date1.add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 23)));
```


For example:

```
void main() {
  var d = DateTime.utc(2020, 05, 27, 0, 0, 0);
  d.add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 23));
  // the prev line has no effect on the value of d
  print(d); // prints: 2020-05-27 00:00:00.000Z

  //But
  d = d.add(Duration(days: 1, hours: 23));
  print(d); // prints: 2020-05-28 23:00:00.000Z
}
```

In simple way without using any lib you can add  and 
var date = new DateTime(2021, 1, 29);

```
date = DateTime(date.year, date.month + 1, date.day);
```


```
date = DateTime(date.year + 1, date.month, date.day);
```

Not so simple.
```
final date = DateTime(2017, 1, 1);
final today = date.add(const Duration(days: 1451));
```

This results in `2020-12-21 23:00:00.000` because Dart considers daylight to calculate dates (so my 1451 days is missing 1 hour, and this is VERY dangerous (for example: Brazil abolished daylight savings in 2019, but if the app was written before that, the result will be forever wrong, same goes if the daylight savings is reintroduced in the future)).
To ignore the dayligh calculations, do this:
```
final date = DateTime(2017, 1, 1);
final today = DateTime(date.year, date.month, date.day + 1451);
```

Yep. Day is 1451 and this is OK. The `today` variable now shows the correct date and time: `2020-12-12 00:00:00.000`.

## It's pretty straightforward.




~ Here I had a requirement of getting the date-time exactly 16 years before today even with milliseconds and in the below way I got my solution.
```
DateTime today = DateTime.now();
debugPrint("Today's date is: $today"); //Today's date is: 2022-03-17 09:08:33.891843
```

After desired subtraction;
```
DateTime desiredDate = DateTime(
    today.year - 16,
    today.month,
    today.day,
    today.hour,
    today.minute,
    today.second,
    today.millisecond,
    today.microsecond,
  );
  debugPrint("16 years ago date is: $desiredDate"); // 16 years before date is: 2006-03-17 09:08:33.891843
```

Increase and Decrease of the day/month/year can be done by DateTime class
Initialise DateFormat which needed to be shown
```
var _inputFormat = DateFormat('EE, d MMM yyyy');
  var _selectedDate = DateTime.now();
```


```
_selectedDate = DateTime(_selectedDate.year,
                        _selectedDate.month + 1, _selectedDate.day);
```


```
_selectedDate = DateTime(_selectedDate.year,
                            _selectedDate.month - 1, _selectedDate.day);
```

Above example is for only month, similar way we can increase or decrease year and day.

Can subtract any count of months.
```
DateTime subtractMonths(int count) {
    var y = count ~/ 12;
    var m = count - y * 12;

    if (m > month) {
      y += 1;
      m = month - m;
    }

    return DateTime(year - y, month - m, day);
  }
```

Also works
```
DateTime(date.year, date.month + (-120), date.day);
```

I'm a fan of using extensions in dart, and we can use them here like this:
```
extension DateHelpers on DateTime {
  DateTime copyWith({
    int? year,
    int? month,
    int? day,
    int? hour,
    int? second,
    int? millisecond,
    int? microsecond,
  }) {
    return DateTime(
      year ?? this.year,
      month ?? this.month,
      day ?? this.day,
      hour ?? this.hour,
      second ?? this.second,
      millisecond ?? this.millisecond,
      microsecond ?? this.microsecond,
    );
  }

  DateTime addYears(int years) {
    return copyWith(year: this.year + years);
  }

  DateTime addMonths(int months) {
    return copyWith(month: this.month + months);
  }

  DateTime addWeeks(int weeks) {
    return copyWith(day: this.day + weeks*7);
  }

  DateTime addDays(int days) {
    return copyWith(day: this.day + days);
  }
}
```

You can then use this utility code as follows:
```
final now = DateTime.now();
final tomorrow = now.addDays(1);
final nextWeek = now.addWeeks(1);
final nextMonth = now.addMonths(1);
final nextYear = now.addYears(1);
```
