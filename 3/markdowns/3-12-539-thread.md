My Flutter application is freezing on the splash screen and I'm getting the following error log:

Looks like the problem is here:
  [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state.cc(148)] Unhandled Exception: MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getApplicationDocumentsDirectory on channel plugins.flutter.io/path_provider)

Already done this:

-Deleted all plugins and reinstalled with `flutter pub get`.
-Runned `flutter clean` and `flutter run`

This error generally occur when you get a plugin and not build the app again. If this is  your case after getting the plugin on pubspec.yaml reinstall your apk. If this is not your problem did you created your project with suport for kotlin and swift? I don't know if this is the case but most of the plugins need this

I got this error for a different plugin after I build the release apk,
this was because code shrinking is enabled by default - if you don't want to minify/obfuscate code just add the two lines inside  android/app/build.gradle.
```
android {
    ...

    buildTypes {
        release {
            ...
         
            shrinkResources false
            minifyEnabled false
        }
    }
}
```

I ran into this after starting to add web support to an application. The getApplicationDocumentsDirectory() function only supports iOS and Android [(docs)](https://pub.dev/documentation/path_provider/latest/path_provider/getApplicationDocumentsDirectory.html). I added a check for web and changed the way I set the directory which fixed the "No implementation found for method" for me.
To tell if the platform is web use Flutter's kIsWeb:
```
import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart' show kIsWeb;
```

Then handle setting the directory accordingly:
```
if (kIsWeb) {
    // Set web-specific directory
} else {
    appDocumentDirectory = await path_provider.getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
}
```

If your package depends on [flutter_facebook_auth](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_facebook_auth), you need to make sure you have performed the setup for [Android](https://facebook.meedu.app/#/android) and iOS to get rid of the error. I was using Hive and Facebook login and surprisingly, the missing Facebook setup was causing Hive.initFlutter() to throw this error.
This fix will work even if you don't actually have the Facebook app setup on your Facebook Developers account.

Turned out I had to quit the flutter run process and start it up again. Just a full restart within flutter run didn't work.

Here is a link for reference [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/10912](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/10912)

Edit: Be sure you import these packages; 


1. package:path_provider/path_provider.dart
2. dart:io
3. dart:async

You just need to reinstall app
OR
You can manage permissions using [https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler](https://pub.dev/packages/permission_handler) runtime
generally when you mention permissions in AndroidManifest.xml file it asks for permission when app starts for first time that's why you need to reinstall app or give permissions from permission manager or you can handle it from your app dynamically using above package

What worked for me is register the corresponding plugin method channel in the `Application.java`(or `Application.kt`). So it's this:
```
package com.example.lifely;

import io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication;
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry;
import io.flutter.plugin.common.PluginRegistry.PluginRegistrantCallback;
import io.flutter.plugins.GeneratedPluginRegistrant;
import io.flutter.plugins.pathprovider.PathProviderPlugin;

public class Application extends FlutterApplication implements PluginRegistrantCallback {
  @Override
  public void registerWith(PluginRegistry registry) {
    PathProviderPlugin.registerWith(registry.registrarFor("io.flutter.plugins.pathprovider.PathProviderPlugin"));
  }
}
```

As the Flutter team working on [Dart plugin registration doesn't run in background isolates #98591](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/98591) for adopting in-package platform channels in more 1P plugins, which requires Dart plugin registration, the plugins do not work in `Isolates` out of the box, The work is still in the progress after the completion you'll need to initialize `DartPluginRegistrant.ensureInitialized()` as `WidgetsFlutterBinding.ensureInitialized()` before.
Until then there is a workaround for it. [#99155](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/99155#issuecomment-1052023743)
The workaround described there will work for `path_provider` as well:
Add dependencies on `path_provider_android` and `path_provider_ios`.
At the beginning of your background isolate entry point, add something like:
```
if (Platform.isAndroid) PathProviderAndroid.registerWith();
if (Platform.isIOS) PathProviderIOS.registerWith();
```

In my case, I haven't included dart:async package. Running "flutter run" and including "dart:async" package resolved the problem

In my case, the snippet below was missing from my AndroidManifest.xml file.
```
<meta-data
            android:name="flutterEmbedding"
            android:value="2" />
```

Adding it in the AndroidManifest.xml file fixed the problem.

Had this error while using  on a  - think it was caused by the 2.0.0 update of path_provider package:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/c7Qvg.png)
I think because the path_provider function that cached_network_image uses (`getTemporaryDirectory()`) doesn't have paths defined on desktop, this causes it to throw the error.
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ziBvg.png)
To solve this (in my case), I imported the path_provider_macos package ([https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_macos](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_macos)) and registered it in main before my app started up.
```
void main() {
  PathProviderMacOS.registerWith();
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```

I haven't tested other platforms but packages exist for linux ([https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_linux](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_linux)) and windows ([https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_windows](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider_windows)) so should hopefully fix the issue on these platforms as well.

With these codes, I got same error with web. It works for Windows.
```
import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
...
  final document = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
  Hive.init(document.path);
```

Replacing it with Hive.initFlutter() looks cover it all (Windows, web, and Android):
```
import 'package:hive_flutter/hive_flutter.dart';
...
  await Hive.initFlutter();
```

PS: I haven't tried on iOS, but should work too.

I had this error ("MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getApplicationDocumentsDirectory on channel plugins.flutter.io/path_provider)") in an old app that I had to run with `flutter run --ignore-deprecation`, because it was using an old Android embedding and I didn't want to migrate it just now.
But it worked out, because I removed this line from my `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` file:
```
android:name="io.flutter.app.FlutterApplication"
```

and magically, the error disappeared! 
Hope it helps someone else, as well.

if you don't have a lot of time trying editing AppDelegate.h of step 5
I pass after updating by following the guide: [Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/wiki/Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects) apply the following actions:

1. Update flutter to its latest stable version -> flutter clean is missing
2. Update all your dependencies (it is very likely that packages have or ask you to add new methods) -> flutter clean is not too much
3. Update the code and methods resulting from the package update
4. Try flutter run or from android Studio |> (some packages may send you missingPluginException but if it is installed on the mobile) go to step 5.
5. Build the test installs for android and IOS if you can (they should work fine). It is likely that in development with flutter run it continues to send the error, in my case I cannot test in IOS but with flutter run it runs for both android and IOS and the problem is solved by adding it to ios / Runner / AppDelegate.h ->[GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry: self]; #import <Flutter / Flutter.h> #import <UIKit / UIKit.h> @interface AppDelegate: FlutterAppDelegate [GeneratedPluginRegistrant registerWithRegistry: self]; @EnD


If after these steps it cannot be executed in step 4 0 5, verify that other dependencies have not updated their versions to be compatible with Upgrading-pre-1.12-Android-projects !. For example cached_network_image uses path_provider try uninstalling the cached_network_image package
Repeat from step 4 again.
