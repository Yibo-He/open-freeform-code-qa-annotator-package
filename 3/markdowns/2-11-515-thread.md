I have a single even-sized vector that I want to transform into a vector of pairs where each pair contains always two elements. I know that I can do this using simple loops but I was wondering if there is a nice standard-library tool for this? It can be assumed that the original vector always contains an even amount of elements.
Example:
```
vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};

vector<pair<int, int>> goal { {1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8} };
```

Use Range-v3:
```
#include <range/v3/range/conversion.hpp>
#include <range/v3/view/transform.hpp>
#include <range/v3/view/chunk.hpp>

using namespace ranges;
using namespace ranges::views;

int main() {
    std::vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> goal {{1, 2}, {3, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 8}};

    auto constexpr makePairFromRangeOf2 = [](auto two){
        return std::make_pair(two.front(), two.back());
    };

    auto result = origin | chunk(2)
                         | transform(makePairFromRangeOf2)
                         | to_vector;
}
```

Notice that if you only have to loop on `result`, then you only need it to be a range, so you can leave `| to_vector` out, because you'll still be able to do `result.begin()` and `result.end()`, which is what makes `result` a range.
If you don't need the inner containers to truly be `std::pair`s, but your just happy with calling, say, `result.front().front()` instead of `result.front().first`, then you can leave also the `transform`, and just be happy with `auto result = origin | chunk(2);`.
You don't mention why you only want a standard solution. However consider that `<ranges>`  standard in C++20. Unfortunately that feature is not as powerful as pre-C++20 Range-v3 library. But it will be at some point (C++23?), I think without any doubts.

As mentioned by @康桓瑋 , if you're willing to also use the ranges-v3 library, you can use a `chunk()` view:
```
std::vector origin = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
auto goal = v | ranges::views::chunk(2) | ranges::to<std::vector>;
```

See it working on [GodBolt](https://godbolt.org/z/PfqWMe6q7).
Unlike my [other answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71113083/1593077), this will be perfectly valid language-wise.
Caveats:
- - - - `chunk()``to()``std::`- `goal``std::pair`

I have a function for handling both even and odd number of elements in a vector. What it does that it takes another parameter to add a number at the end of pair. `C++ 20`, there is `Range-v3` library which will be in `C++ 23` which isn't released yet.
Here is the [try it online](https://godbolt.org/z/az8z8564P) link.
```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

// time complexity: O(n / 2), where `n` is the length of `my_vec`
std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> vec_to_pair(const std::vector<int> &my_vec, int odd_origin)
{
    std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> val;
    for (std::size_t i = 0; i < my_vec.size(); i += 2)
    {
        int sec_val;
        if (i < my_vec.size() - 1)
            sec_val = my_vec[i + 1];
        else if (my_vec.size() % 2 != 0)
            sec_val = odd_origin;
        else 
            break;
        int data[] = {my_vec[i], sec_val};
        val.push_back({data[0], data[1]});
    }
    return val;
}

void print(const std::vector<std::pair<int, int>> &vec)
{
    std::cout << "{ ";
    for (auto &&i : vec)
        std::cout << "{ " << i.first << ", " << i.second << " }  ";
    std::cout << " }" << std::endl;
}

int main(void)
{
    std::vector<int> vec1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};    // odd
    std::vector<int> vec2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; // even

    auto x1 = vec_to_pair(vec1, -1);
    auto x2 = vec_to_pair(vec2, 0);

    print(x1);
    print(x2);

    return 0;
}
```

Simple way of doing this without using the range v3 library:
```
template <typename T>
std::vector<std::pair<T, T>> windowed(const std::vector<T> &vec) {
    const size_t size = vec.size();
    if (size % 2 != 0) {
        throw std::exception("Vector does not contain an even amount of elements!");
    }
    
    std::vector<std::pair<T, T>> result;
    for (size_t i = 0; i < size; i = i + 2) {
        const T &left = vec.at(i);
        const T &right = vec.at(i + 1);
        result.emplace_back(left, right);
    }
    return result;
}
```

## The intuitive, but unfortunately invalid, way to do it


There's a quick-and-dirty approach, which will kinda-hopefully-maybe do what you asked for, and will not even copy the data at all... but the downside is that you can't be certain it will work. It relies on [undefined behavior](https://stackoverflow.com/q/4105120/1593077), and can thus not be recommended. I'm describing it because I believe it's what one imagines, intuitively, that we might be able to do.
So, it's about using [std::span](https://stackoverflow.com/q/45723819/1593077) with re-interpretation of the vector data:
```
std::vector<int> origin {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
auto raw_data = reinterpret_cast<std::pair<int, int>*>(origin.data());
std::span<std::pair<int, int>> goal { raw_data, origin.size()/2 };
```

See this on [GodBolt](https://godbolt.org/z/31Wzhfn4s)
Caveats:
- `reinterpret_cast``std::pair`[mdspan](https://github.com/kokkos/mdspan)`mdspan`- - `goal.data()`
