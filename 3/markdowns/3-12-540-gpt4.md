Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components. This can be achieved using various widgets, but the most common one is the `VerticalDivider` widget. 

Here's a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your first component goes here
      ),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your second component goes here
      ),
    ),
    const VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.grey,
      thickness: 1,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Container(
        // Your third component goes here
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three components. You can adjust the color and thickness of the lines as per your requirements. 

Remember to import the material.dart package:

```dart
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
```

Also, note that `VerticalDivider` is not visible if the parent widget does not specify the height, and it does not occupy any space if used in a row without an `Expanded` or `Flexible` widget.

Yes, you can draw vertical lines between components in Flutter. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget or the `Container` widget with a specified height and width.

Here is an example of how you can use the `VerticalDivider` widget:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 1')),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 2')),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `VerticalDivider` widget creates a vertical line between two text widgets.

If you want to use the `Container` widget to create a vertical line, you can do it like this:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 1')),
    Container(
      height: double.infinity,
      width: 2,
      color: Colors.black,
    ),
    Expanded(child: Text('Component 2')),
  ],
)
```

In this example, the `Container` widget creates a vertical line between two text widgets. You can adjust the height, width, and color of the line as needed.

Yes, in Flutter, you can draw vertical lines between components. You can use the `VerticalDivider` widget or the `Container` widget with a specified width and color to achieve this. Here's a simple example:

```dart
Row(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 1'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 2'),
    ),
    VerticalDivider(
      color: Colors.black,
      thickness: 2,
    ),
    Expanded(
      child: Text('Component 3'),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this example, `VerticalDivider` is used to draw vertical lines between three components. You can customize the color and thickness of the line as per your requirements. 

If you want to use `Container` to draw the line, you can replace `VerticalDivider` with:

```dart
Container(
  height: double.infinity,
  width: 2,
  color: Colors.black,
)
```

This will also draw a vertical line. The height is set to `double.infinity` to make the line take up all available vertical space. The width is set to `2` to make the line 2 pixels wide. The color is set to `Colors.black` to make the line black.
