This method submits a simple HTTP request and calls a success or error callback just fine:

```
void _getSimpleReply( String command, callback, errorCallback ) async {

    try {

      HttpClientRequest request = await _myClient.get( _serverIPAddress, _serverPort, '/' );

      HttpClientResponse response = await request.close();

      response.transform( utf8.decoder ).listen( (onData) { callback( onData ); } );

    } on SocketException catch( e ) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    }
  }
```


If the server isn't running, the Android-app more or less instantly calls the errorCallback.

On iOS, the errorCallback takes a very long period of time - more than 20 seconds - until any callback gets called.

The difference in behavior between Android and iOS is due to the different default timeout settings on the underlying platforms for network requests. Android has a shorter default timeout than iOS.

To fix this issue, you can set a timeout directly in your Dart code. This way, you ensure that the errorCallback is called after a certain period of time regardless of the platform. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
void _getSimpleReply( String command, callback, errorCallback ) async {
    try {
        HttpClientRequest request = await _myClient.get( _serverIPAddress, _serverPort, '/' )
            .timeout(const Duration(seconds: 5), onTimeout: () {
                // Handle timeout here
                errorCallback('Request timed out');
                return;
            });

        HttpClientResponse response = await request.close();

        response.transform( utf8.decoder ).listen( (onData) { callback( onData ); } );

    } on SocketException catch( e ) {
        errorCallback( e.toString() );
    }
}
```

In this code, I've added a timeout of 5 seconds to the request. If the request doesn't complete within this time, the `onTimeout` function is called, which in turn calls the `errorCallback` with a timeout message. You can adjust the duration to fit your needs.

This is likely due to the different default timeout settings on Android and iOS for HTTP requests. Android's default timeout is typically shorter than iOS's. 

In Dart's HttpClient, there is no direct way to set a timeout. However, you can use the `Future.timeout` method to achieve this. Here's how you can modify your method to include a timeout:

```dart
void _getSimpleReply( String command, callback, errorCallback ) async {

    try {

      HttpClientRequest request = await _myClient.get( _serverIPAddress, _serverPort, '/' )
        .timeout(const Duration(seconds: 5)); // Set your desired timeout duration

      HttpClientResponse response = await request.close();

      response.transform( utf8.decoder ).listen( (onData) { callback( onData ); } );

    } on SocketException catch( e ) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    } on TimeoutException catch (e) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    }
  }
```

In this example, if the request takes more than 5 seconds, it will throw a `TimeoutException` and call the `errorCallback`. You can adjust the duration to suit your needs.

This is likely due to the different timeout settings on Android and iOS for HTTP requests. Android has a shorter default timeout than iOS, which is why you're seeing the errorCallback being called almost instantly on Android when the server isn't running, but not on iOS.

To fix this, you can set a timeout on the HTTP request. Here's how you can modify your method to include a timeout:

```dart
void _getSimpleReply( String command, callback, errorCallback ) async {

    try {

      HttpClientRequest request = await _myClient.get( _serverIPAddress, _serverPort, '/' )
          .timeout(const Duration(seconds: 5)); // Set a timeout of 5 seconds

      HttpClientResponse response = await request.close();

      response.transform( utf8.decoder ).listen( (onData) { callback( onData ); } );

    } on SocketException catch( e ) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    } on TimeoutException catch (e) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    }
  }
```

In this code, I've added a timeout of 5 seconds to the HTTP request. If the request doesn't complete within 5 seconds, a `TimeoutException` is thrown, which is then caught and passed to the errorCallback. You can adjust the timeout duration to whatever you think is appropriate for your app.
