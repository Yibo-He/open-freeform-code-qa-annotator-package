I am using row widget with three child widgets:
Text
Icon
Text

I want all of them to appear in single line same level horizontally  and drop to new line if text increases.

I am using below code for Row widget but last Text widget is not aligned correctly
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1eeS.png)

The text dropping should start below the "`Tap`" and "`on the right hand`" is not aligned

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Expanded(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

The problem you're facing is due to the fact that the `Row` widget tries to place all its children in a single line. When the text in the last `Text` widget is too long, it overflows and wraps to the next line, but it starts where the `Icon` widget is placed because the `Row` widget doesn't know that it should start a new line.

To solve this, you can use the `Wrap` widget instead of `Row`. The `Wrap` widget automatically adjusts its children along both the horizontal and vertical axis as needed. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.start,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Expanded(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

However, the `Expanded` widget doesn't work with `Wrap`. So, you need to remove it and use `Flexible` instead. Here's the final code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.start,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Flexible(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

This will ensure that the text wraps correctly and starts a new line below "Tap" when it's too long to fit on the same line.

In Flutter, if you want to align multiple widgets in a single line and want the text to drop to the next line if it increases, you can use the `Wrap` widget instead of `Row`. The `Wrap` widget automatically adjusts its children along both the horizontal and vertical axis.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Text(
      'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this code, `WrapCrossAlignment.center` is used to align the widgets in the center. The `Wrap` widget will automatically move the text to the next line if it doesn't fit on the screen.

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that the `Row` widget tries to place all its children in a single line. When the text is too long to fit, it wraps to the next line but it's still considered as a single widget in the row, so it starts where the `Icon` widget ends.

To achieve the desired effect, you can wrap your `Text` and `Icon` widgets in a `Wrap` widget instead of a `Row`. The `Wrap` widget automatically arranges its children and moves them to the next line when there's not enough space.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
Wrap(
  crossAxisAlignment: WrapCrossAlignment.center,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Text(
      'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
  ],
)
```

In this code, the `Wrap` widget places the `Text` and `Icon` widgets in a line, and if there's not enough space for the second `Text` widget, it moves it to the next line. The `crossAxisAlignment` property is set to `WrapCrossAlignment.center` to align the widgets in the center vertically.
