I am learning C++ with experiencein mostly Python, R and SQL.
The way arrays (and vectors which differes somehow from 1d-arrays? and matrices which are 2d-arrays?) work in C++ seems quite different as I cannot specify the size of dimension of the array with an argument from the function.
A toy-example of my goal is some thing like this:

1. Have a function my_2d_array which takes two arguments M and N and returns a matrix or 2d-array of dimension (MxN) with elements indicating the position of that element. E.g. calling my_2d_array(4,3) would return: [[00, 01, 02], [10, 11, 12], [20, 21, 22], [30, 31, 32]]
2. The main function should execute my_2d_array and be able to potentially perform calculations with the result or modify it.


This is my attempt (with errors):
```
int my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    int A[N][M];
    
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::string element = std::to_string(i) + std::to_string(j);
            A[i][j] = element;
        }
    }
    return A;
}


void main() {
    int N, M;
    N = 4;
    M = 3;

    int A[N][M] = my_2d_array(N, M);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::cout << A[i][j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

}
```

One (1) dimensional attempt of @JustLearning's suggestion:
```
int my_array(int N) {
    std::array<int, N> A;

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        A[i] = i;
    }
    return A;
}


int main() {
    int N = 4;

    int A[N] = my_array(N);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        std::cout << A[i] << " ";
    }

}
```

In C++, the size of an array must be known at compile-time, which means that you cannot use a variable to specify the size of an array. However, there are alternatives to achieve what you want.

One option is to use dynamic memory allocation with pointers. You can allocate memory for a 2D array using a pointer to a pointer, and then use nested loops to initialize the elements. Here's an example:

```
int** my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    int** A = new int*[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        A[i] = new int[M];
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            A[i][j] = i * 10 + j;
        }
    }
    return A;
}

int main() {
    int N = 4;
    int M = 3;

    int** A = my_2d_array(N, M);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::cout << A[i][j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    // Free the memory
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        delete[] A[i];
    }
    delete[] A;
}
```

Note that you need to free the memory allocated with `new` using `delete` to avoid memory leaks.

Another option is to use a one-dimensional array and compute the indices using some arithmetic. For example, to access the element at row `i` and column `j` in a 2D array of size `N` by `M`, you can use the formula `A[i * M + j]`. Here's an example:

```
int* my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    int* A = new int[N * M];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            A[i * M + j] = i * 10 + j;
        }
    }
    return A;
}

int main() {
    int N = 4;
    int M = 3;

    int* A = my_2d_array(N, M);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::cout << A[i * M + j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    // Free the memory
    delete[] A;
}
```

Note that you only need to free the memory allocated with `new` using `delete[]` in this case.

In C++, the size of an array must be known at compile time. Therefore, you cannot use a variable to specify the size of an array. However, you can use dynamic memory allocation to create an array of a specified size at runtime. One way to do this is to use a pointer to an array and allocate memory for it using the `new` operator.

Here's an example of how you can modify your code to create a 2D array of size MxN and return it from the `my_2d_array` function:

```
int** my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    int** A = new int*[N];
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        A[i] = new int[M];
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            A[i][j] = i * 10 + j;
        }
    }
    return A;
}

int main() {
    int N = 4;
    int M = 3;

    int** A = my_2d_array(N, M);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::cout << A[i][j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    // Free memory
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        delete[] A[i];
    }
    delete[] A;
}
```

In this example, `my_2d_array` creates a 2D array of size MxN using dynamic memory allocation. It returns a pointer to the array, which is assigned to `A` in the `main` function. The array is then printed using nested loops.

Note that you need to free the memory allocated for the array using the `delete` operator. This is done in the `main` function after the array has been printed.

Regarding your question about vectors, they are similar to arrays but with some additional features such as dynamic resizing. Vectors can be used to create 1D arrays of a specified size at runtime. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to create a 1D array of size N using a vector:

```
#include <vector>

std::vector<int> my_array(int N) {
    std::vector<int> A(N);
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        A[i] = i;
    }
    return A;
}

int main() {
    int N = 4;

    std::vector<int> A = my_array(N);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        std::cout << A[i] << " ";
    }
}
```

In this example, `my_array` creates a 1D array of size N using a vector. It returns the vector, which is assigned to `A` in the `main` function. The array is then printed using a loop. Note that you don't need to free the memory allocated for the vector as it is automatically managed by the vector class.

In C++, the size of an array must be known at compile-time, which means that the size must be a constant expression. Therefore, you cannot use a variable to specify the size of an array.

One way to achieve your goal is to use a dynamic array, such as a vector. A vector is a container that can dynamically resize itself, which means that you can specify the size of the vector at runtime.

Here's an example of how you can use a vector to create a 2D array:

```
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

std::vector<std::vector<int>> my_2d_array(int N, int M) {
    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A(N, std::vector<int>(M));

    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            A[i][j] = i * 10 + j;
        }
    }
    return A;
}

int main() {
    int N = 4;
    int M = 3;

    std::vector<std::vector<int>> A = my_2d_array(N, M);

    // Print the array A
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        for (int j = 0; j < M; j++) {
            std::cout << A[i][j] << " ";
        }
        std::cout << "\n";
    }

    return 0;
}
```

In this example, `my_2d_array` returns a vector of vectors, where the outer vector has size `N` and the inner vectors have size `M`. The elements of the array are initialized to the value `i * 10 + j`, which corresponds to the position of the element.

Note that you need to include the `<vector>` header to use vectors. Also, the `main` function should return an `int`.
