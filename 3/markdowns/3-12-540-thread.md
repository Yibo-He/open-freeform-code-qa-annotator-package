Not as far as I know. However, it is quite simple to create one — if you look at the source for [Flutter's Divider](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/blob/master/packages/flutter/lib/src/material/divider.dart) you'll see that it is simply a `SizedBox` with a single (bottom) border. You could do the same but with dimensions switched.

 (Oct 4, 2018): a `VerticalDivider` implementation has been [merged in](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/22641) by the Flutter team. Check out the [docs](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/VerticalDivider-class.html) but it's very simple to use — simply put it between two other items in a row.
: If you are using `VerticalDivider` as separator in `Row` widget  then wrap `Row` with `IntrinsicHeight`, `Container` or `SizedBox` else `VerticalDivider` will not show up. For `Container` and `SizedBox` widget you need define `height`.

As of 10 days ago, flutter [has merged](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/22641) a `VerticalDivider` implementation. It will be available in the default channel very soon, but for now you have to switch to the dev channel to use it: `flutter channel dev`.

Here is a example of how to use it:

```
IntrinsicHeight(
    child: new Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Foo'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Bar'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Baz'),
  ],
))
```

### Vertical divider:


- ```
VerticalDivider(
  color: Colors.black,
  thickness: 2,
)
```
- `Row`[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ZG7l4.png)```
IntrinsicHeight(
  child: Row(
    children: [
      Text('Hello'),
      VerticalDivider(
        color: Colors.black,
        thickness: 2,
      ),
      Text('World'),
    ],
  ),
)
```

### Horizontal divider:


- ```
Divider(
  color: Colors.black,
  thickness: 2,
)
```
- `Column`[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KbLHF.png)```
IntrinsicWidth(
  child: Column(
    children: [
      Text('Hello'),
      Divider(
        color: Colors.black,
        thickness: 2,
      ),
      Text('World'),
    ],
  ),
)
```

Try to wrap it inside the `Container` with some height as

```
Container(height: 80, child: VerticalDivider(color: Colors.red)),
```

Tried with `VerticalDivider()` but cannot get any divider. I Solved it with

```
Container(color: Colors.black45, height: 50, width: 2,),
```

You can use a vertical divider with a thickness of 1.
```
VerticalDivider(
            thickness: 1,
            color: Color(0xFFF6F4F4),
          ),
```

And if you can't see the vertical divider wrap the row with a  widget.

Just wrap your Row in IntrinsicHeight widget and you should get the desired result:
```
IntrinsicHeight(
    child: Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text('Name'),
    VerticalDivider(),
    Text('Contact'),
  ],
))
```

As @rwynnchristian suggested, this seems to be the simplest solution IMO. Just leaving the code here:

```
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';
class VerticalDivider extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) => RotatedBox(
    quarterTurns: 1,
    child: Divider(),
  );
}
```

add this method anywhere.

```
_verticalDivider() => BoxDecoration(
      border: Border(
        right: BorderSide(
          color: Theme.of(context).dividerColor,
          width: 0.5,
        ),
      ),
    );
```


now wrap your content in container

```
Container(
  decoration: _verticalDivider(),
  child: //your widget code
);
```

, wrap your row in IntrinsicHeight()
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/dJjdJ.png)
```
IntrinsicHeight(
                child: Row(
                  children: [
                    Text(
                      'Admissions',
                      style: TextStyle(fontSize: 34),
                    ),
                    Container(width: 1, color: Colors.black), // This is divider
                    Text('another text'),
                  ],
                ),
```

You need to wrap `VerticalDivider()` widget with the `IntrinsicHeight` widget. Otherwise, the vertical divider will not show up. And to gain some padding over the top and bottom you can add indent.
```
IntrinsicHeight(
                child: Row(
                  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
                  children: [
                    Flexible(
                      child: VerticalDivider(
                        thickness: 0.8,
                        color: Colors.grey,
                      ),
                    ),
                    Flexible(
                      child: Text(
                        "Random Text",
                        style: TextStyle(
                            fontSize: 12,
                            color: AppColor.darkHintTextColor,),
                      ),
                    ),
                  ],
                ),
              )
```

I guess i found a more robust solution when dealing with this problem;[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/8fxNh.png)
```
IntrinsicHeight(
                  child: Row(
                    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceEvenly,
                    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
                    children: [
                      Expanded(
                        child: Container(
                          decoration: BoxDecoration(borderRadius: BoxRadius.circular(),color: Colors.gray),
                          height: 5,
                          margin: CustomPaddings.horizontal(),
                        ),
                      ),
                      Text(
                        "TEST",
                        style: Theme.of(context)
                            .textTheme
                            .subtitle1!
                            .copyWith(
                                color: Colors.black,
                                fontWeight: FontWeight.bold),
                      ),
                      Expanded(
                        child: Container(
                          decoration: BoxDecoration(borderRadius: BoxRadius.circular(),color: Colors.gray),

                    ],

Try RotatedBox in combination with a divider to get it vertical, RotatedBox is a widget of flutter that automatically rotates it's child based on the quarterTurn property you have to specify.  Head over to here for a detailed explanation [https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/RotatedBox-class.html](https://docs.flutter.io/flutter/widgets/RotatedBox-class.html)
