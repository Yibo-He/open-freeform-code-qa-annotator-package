I have checked a lot of issues about the link of filesystem under c++17 and I still cannot make the link successfully. My `main.cpp` file is as the following.

```
#include <experimental/filesystem>


int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```


My `CMakeLists.txt` is as the following. 

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)

project(visual_hull LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_library(dataIO
        STATIC
            dataIO.hpp
            dataIO.cpp)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)

target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS})

add_executable(visual_hull main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(visual_hull PUBLIC dataIO
                                         stdc++fs)
```


The error is as the following.

```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that the compiler cannot find the `std::filesystem` namespace. This is because the `<experimental/filesystem>` header is not included in your `main.cpp` file.

In C++17, the `<experimental/filesystem>` header was replaced with `<filesystem>`. Therefore, you need to change the include statement in your `main.cpp` file to:

```
#include <filesystem>
```

Also, since `<filesystem>` is a standard library header, you do not need to link against any additional libraries. Therefore, you can remove the `stdc++fs` library from your `target_link_libraries` statement in your `CMakeLists.txt` file.

After making these changes, your `main.cpp` file should look like this:

```
#include <filesystem>


int main(int argc, char** argv)
{
    std::string imageDirectory = "./image";;
    std::vector<std::string> imagePath;

    for (const auto& entry: std::filesystem::directory_iterator(imageDirectory))
    {
        imagePath.push_back(entry.path());
        std::cout << entry.path() << std::endl;
    }

    return 0;
}
```

And your `CMakeLists.txt` file should look like this:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)

project(visual_hull LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_library(dataIO
        STATIC
            dataIO.hpp
            dataIO.cpp)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)

target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS})

add_executable(visual_hull main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(visual_hull PUBLIC dataIO)
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that the `std::filesystem` namespace has not been declared. This is because the `std::filesystem` library was introduced in C++17 and may not be available in older versions of the C++ standard library.

To fix this issue, you need to add the `stdc++fs` library to your `target_link_libraries` command in your `CMakeLists.txt` file. This library provides the necessary support for the `std::filesystem` library.

Here is the updated `CMakeLists.txt` file:

```
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.8 FATAL_ERROR)

project(visual_hull LANGUAGES CXX)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)
add_library(dataIO
        STATIC
            dataIO.hpp
            dataIO.cpp)

find_package(OpenCV REQUIRED core highgui imgproc)

target_link_libraries(dataIO ${OpenCV_LIBS})

add_executable(visual_hull main.cpp)

target_link_libraries(visual_hull PUBLIC dataIO
                                         stdc++fs)
```

With this change, the `std::filesystem` library should be available in your code and the error should be resolved.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like you are missing the `#include <filesystem>` header in your `main.cpp` file. You have included `<experimental/filesystem>` but that is not the correct header for C++17. 

Try changing the header to `<filesystem>` and see if that resolves the issue.
