So I insert admob ads inside the List. And I added the functionality of infinity scroll inside the list view. So when the user scrolls to end of the list, new items are added into the list. With this items I also add admob ads inside it.
So when the users scroll to the end the new items and ads are added into the List. At that time the below exceptions are caught. So how to solve this exception.
```
======== Exception caught by widgets library =======================================================
The following assertion was thrown building AdWidget-[#53ef3](dirty, state: _AdWidgetState#850ac):
This AdWidget is already in the Widget tree


If you placed this AdWidget in a list, make sure you create a new instance in the builder function with a unique ad object.
Make sure you are not using the same ad object in more than one AdWidget.

The relevant error-causing widget was: 
  AdWidget-[#53ef3] file:///D:/flutter%20project/memer/lib/pages/TimeLinePage.dart:198:42

The error message is quite clear: "Make sure you are not using the same ad object in more than one AdWidget". This means that you are trying to use the same `BannerAd` object in multiple `AdWidget`s, which is not allowed.

In your case, you are using `posts[index] as BannerAd` as your ad object. If the same `BannerAd` object is used in multiple `AdWidget`s, it will cause this error.

To solve this issue, you need to ensure that each `AdWidget` has its own unique `BannerAd` object. You can do this by creating a new `BannerAd` object for each `AdWidget`.

Here is an example of how you can modify your code:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post) {
      return posts[index];
    } else {
      // Create a new BannerAd object for each AdWidget
      final bannerAd = BannerAd(
        adUnitId: '<your-ad-unit-id>',
        size: AdSize.banner,
        request: AdRequest(),
        listener: BannerAdListener(),
      )..load();

      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: bannerAd),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics()),
);
```

Please replace `<your-ad-unit-id>` with your actual AdMob ad unit ID. Also, you may need to customize the `BannerAdListener` according to your needs.

The error message suggests that you are using the same `AdWidget` in more than one place in your widget tree. This is not allowed. Each `AdWidget` should have a unique `Ad` object.

The problem is that you are using the same `BannerAd` object for multiple `AdWidget`s. Each `AdWidget` should have its own `BannerAd` object.

Here's how you can fix it:

1. Create a new `BannerAd` for each `AdWidget` you want to display. You can do this in your `ListView.builder` method.

2. Make sure that you dispose of the `BannerAd` when it's no longer needed. You can do this in the `dispose` method of your widget.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post){
      return posts[index];
    }
    else {
      final BannerAd myBanner = BannerAd(
        adUnitId: '<your-admob-unit-id>',
        size: AdSize.banner,
        request: AdRequest(),
        listener: AdListener(),
      )..load();

      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: myBanner),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics())
);
```

Remember to dispose of the `BannerAd` when it's no longer needed:

```dart
@override
void dispose() {
  // Dispose of the BannerAd object to free up resources.
  for (var post in posts) {
    if (post is BannerAd) {
      post.dispose();
    }
  }
  super.dispose();
}
```

This should solve your problem. Let me know if you have any other questions.

The error message is pretty clear. It says that you are using the same `AdWidget` in more than one place in your widget tree. 

The `AdWidget` is a widget that wraps an `Ad` object. The `Ad` object is a representation of the ad that is being shown. Each `Ad` object can only be associated with one `AdWidget`. If you try to associate the same `Ad` object with more than one `AdWidget`, you will get the error that you are seeing.

In your case, you are creating a new `AdWidget` for each item in your list, but you are using the same `Ad` object (`posts[index]`) for each of them. This is what is causing the error.

To fix this, you need to make sure that you are creating a new `Ad` object for each `AdWidget`. One way to do this is to create a new `Ad` object in your `itemBuilder` function, like this:

```dart
return ListView.builder(
  itemBuilder: (context, index) {
    if(posts[index] is Post) {
      return posts[index];
    } else {
      final ad = AdmobService.createBannerAd()..load(); // create a new Ad object
      final Container adContainer = Container(
        alignment: Alignment.center,
        child: AdWidget(key: UniqueKey(), ad: ad),
        height: 50,
      );
      return adContainer;
    }
  },
  itemCount: posts.length,
  controller: scrollController,
  physics: const BouncingScrollPhysics(parent: AlwaysScrollableScrollPhysics()),
);
```

In this code, `AdmobService.createBannerAd()` is a hypothetical function that creates a new `Ad` object. You would need to replace this with your actual function for creating ads.
