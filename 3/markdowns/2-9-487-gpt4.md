I have been using heroku redis for a while now on one of my side projects. I currently use it for 3 things

1. It serves as a place for me to store firebase certificates
2. It is used for caching data on the site
3. It is used for rails sidekiq jobs


Recently, my heroku usage went up and I had to change it to use heroku redis premium plan. Ever since then I have been getting `error: SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain)` somehow. Everything stayed the same yet the error started popping out of nowhere.
Does heroku-redis premium plan work fundamentally different than a basic heroku-redis plan?
I am using ruby on rails, deployed on heroku with heroku redis if that helps.

Heroku Redis Premium plans do not fundamentally differ from basic plans in terms of how they function. They offer more features and resources, but the underlying technology and the way you interact with it remains the same. 

The error you're seeing `SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain)` is typically related to SSL certificate verification issues. 

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your Redis connection URL**: Ensure that you're using the correct Redis connection URL. You can find this in your Heroku dashboard under the "Settings" tab of your Redis instance. 

2. **Update your SSL certificates**: The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the SSL certificate. You can try updating your SSL certificates. If you're using a self-signed certificate, ensure that it's correctly installed and trusted.

3. **Disable SSL certificate verification**: If you're in a development environment and understand the risks, you can try disabling SSL certificate verification. You can do this by adding `verify_mode: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE` to your Redis connection settings. However, this is not recommended for production environments as it can expose you to man-in-the-middle attacks.

4. **Contact Heroku Support**: If none of the above solutions work, it might be a good idea to reach out to Heroku's support team. They can help you diagnose and resolve the issue.

Remember, it's important to keep your system and all its components (including SSL certificates) up-to-date to avoid such issues.

The Heroku Redis premium plan does not work fundamentally different than the basic plan. The main differences are in the amount of available memory, the number of connections, and the availability of certain features like persistence and high availability.

The error you're seeing (`SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain)`) is related to SSL certificate verification. It seems like the SSL certificate of the Redis server is not being correctly verified.

Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check the SSL configuration:** Make sure that the SSL configuration for your Redis connection is correctly set up. You might need to explicitly enable SSL when connecting to Redis.

2. **Update your Redis client:** If you're using an older version of the Redis client in your Rails application, it might not correctly support the SSL features required by Heroku Redis. Try updating to the latest version.

3. **Disable SSL certificate verification:** This is generally not recommended for production environments, as it can make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. However, for testing purposes, you could try disabling SSL certificate verification to see if that resolves the issue. If it does, then the problem is likely with the SSL certificate or its configuration.

4. **Contact Heroku Support:** If none of the above solutions work, it might be a good idea to reach out to Heroku support. They might be able to provide more insight into the issue, especially if it's something specific to Heroku Redis.

Remember to never share sensitive information like SSL certificates or private keys in public forums or with untrusted parties.

Heroku Redis premium plans do not fundamentally differ from the basic plans in terms of how they work. They offer more resources and features, but the underlying technology and the way you interact with them are the same.

The error you're seeing (`SSL_connect returned=1 errno=0 state=error: certificate verify failed (self signed certificate in certificate chain)`) is related to SSL certificate verification. It seems like your application is unable to verify the SSL certificate of the Redis server.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check the SSL Mode:** Heroku Redis supports three different SSL modes: `require`, `verify-ca`, and `verify-full`. If your SSL mode is set to `verify-full` or `verify-ca`, it will perform SSL certificate verification. You might want to set it to `require` which will still use SSL but won't perform the certificate verification.

2. **Update your SSL Certificate Store:** The issue might be due to an outdated or missing SSL certificate store in your environment. You can update it or point your application to the correct certificate store.

3. **Check your Redis client:** Ensure that your Redis client library in Ruby on Rails is up-to-date and supports the SSL/TLS protocol version used by Heroku Redis.

4. **Contact Heroku Support:** If none of the above solutions work, it might be a good idea to reach out to Heroku support. They might be able to provide more insight into the issue.

Remember to never disable SSL completely as it's essential for secure communication.
