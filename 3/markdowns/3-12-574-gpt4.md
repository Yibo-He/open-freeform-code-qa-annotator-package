Somebody knows how can I extract from DateTime the name of the day of the week?

ej: 

```
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
String dateFormat = DateFormat('dd-MM-yyyy hh:mm').format(date);
```


Result -> Friday

You can use the `weekday` property of `DateTime` object to get the day of the week as an integer where 1 represents Monday and 7 represents Sunday. Then you can map these integers to the actual names of the days of the week. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
DateTime date = DateTime.now();
String dayOfWeek = '';

switch (date.weekday) {
  case 1:
    dayOfWeek = 'Monday';
    break;
  case 2:
    dayOfWeek = 'Tuesday';
    break;
  case 3:
    dayOfWeek = 'Wednesday';
    break;
  case 4:
    dayOfWeek = 'Thursday';
    break;
  case 5:
    dayOfWeek = 'Friday';
    break;
  case 6:
    dayOfWeek = 'Saturday';
    break;
  case 7:
    dayOfWeek = 'Sunday';
    break;
}

print(dayOfWeek); // It will print the current day of the week
```

However, if you want to use `DateFormat`, you can use the 'EEEE' pattern to get the day of the week:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

DateTime date = DateTime.now();
String dayOfWeek = DateFormat('EEEE').format(date);

print(dayOfWeek); // It will print the current day of the week
```

In this case, you need to add `intl` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  intl: ^0.17.0
```

Then run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

You can use the `weekday` property of `DateTime` object to get the day of the week as an integer where 1 represents Monday and 7 represents Sunday. Then you can convert this integer to the name of the day of the week.

However, if you want to get the name of the day directly, you can use the `DateFormat` class from the `intl` package. Here is how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

void main() {
  DateTime date = DateTime.now();
  String dayName = DateFormat('EEEE').format(date);
  print(dayName);
}
```

In this code, 'EEEE' represents the full name of the day of the week. The `DateFormat` class uses the ICU format patterns. You can find more information about these patterns in the [Unicode Technical Standard #35](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Date_Field_Symbol_Table).

Remember to add the `intl` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  intl: ^0.17.0
```

Then, run `flutter pub get` to fetch the package.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use the `weekday` property of `DateTime` to get the day of the week as an integer, where 1 represents Monday and 7 represents Sunday. Then, you can convert this integer to a string representation of the day of the week.

However, if you want to get the name of the day of the week directly, you can use the `DateFormat` class from the `intl` package in Dart. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

DateTime date = DateTime.now();
String dayName = DateFormat('EEEE').format(date);

print(dayName); // Prints the name of the day of the week
```

In this code, 'EEEE' is a format that represents the full name of the day of the week. When you call `DateFormat('EEEE').format(date)`, it formats the given date as the full name of the day of the week.

Please note that you need to add the `intl` package to your `pubspec.yaml` file to use the `DateFormat` class:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter

  intl: ^0.17.0
```

After adding this, run `flutter pub get` in your terminal to fetch the package.
