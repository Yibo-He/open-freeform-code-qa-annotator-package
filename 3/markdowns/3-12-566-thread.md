The fact is that the IDE seems to recently have started using embedding devtools in the inspector tab. I have my Flutter version up to date and my Android Studio's version is 4.1. Until the problem gets solved I have three possible solutions:
- - 
> flutter.bat pub global activate devtools
> flutter.bat pub global run devtools
-

And by the way, in order to use Devtools you should first make sure your application is running ;)
As I said before, they seem to be already fixing the problem. They made other changes to DevTools management that should solve the issue. For more information you should go to: [https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/5032](https://github.com/flutter/flutter-intellij/issues/5032)

By running `File > Invalid Caches / Restart...`, the problem was fixed
