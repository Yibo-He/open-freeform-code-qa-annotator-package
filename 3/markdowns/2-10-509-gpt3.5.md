I have a vector of strings.I need to convert it to HashMap.
Vector's 0 elements should become a key and 1 element should become a value. The same for 2, 3, and so on.
The obvious solution, just to make a for loop and add them to HashMap one by one. However, it will end up several lines of code. I am curious whether there is a cleaner, one-liner.
I know you can do vec.to_iter().collect(). However, this requires a vector to have tuples (vs a flat vector).

You can use the `chunks` method of the `Vec` to group the elements into pairs, and then use the `collect` method to create a `HashMap` from the pairs. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let vec = vec!["key1", "value1", "key2", "value2", "key3", "value3"];
    let map: HashMap<_, _> = vec.chunks(2).map(|chunk| (chunk[0], chunk[1])).collect();
    println!("{:?}", map);
}
```

This will output:

```
{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
```

The `chunks` method groups the elements into pairs of two, and the `map` method transforms each pair into a tuple `(key, value)`. Finally, the `collect` method creates a `HashMap` from the tuples.

You can use the `chunks` method of the `Vec` to group the elements into pairs, and then use the `collect` method to create a `HashMap` from the pairs. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let vec = vec!["key1", "value1", "key2", "value2", "key3", "value3"];
    let map: HashMap<_, _> = vec.chunks(2).map(|chunk| (chunk[0], chunk[1])).collect();
    println!("{:?}", map);
}
```

This will output:

```
{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
```

In this example, `chunks(2)` groups the elements into pairs, and `map` transforms each pair into a tuple `(key, value)`. Finally, `collect` creates a `HashMap` from the tuples.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `chunks()` method of the `Vec` to group the elements into pairs, and then use `collect()` to create a `HashMap` from the pairs. Here's an example:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;

fn main() {
    let vec = vec!["key1", "value1", "key2", "value2", "key3", "value3"];
    let map: HashMap<_, _> = vec.chunks(2).map(|chunk| (chunk[0], chunk[1])).collect();
    println!("{:?}", map);
}
```

This will output:

```
{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2", "key3": "value3"}
```

The `chunks()` method returns an iterator over non-overlapping chunks of the vector, where each chunk has a length of 2. The `map()` method is then used to transform each chunk into a tuple of `(key, value)`, and finally `collect()` is used to create a `HashMap` from the tuples.
