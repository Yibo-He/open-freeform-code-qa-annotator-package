## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error you're encountering is related to the compatibility of Devise with Ruby 3.0.0. The Devise version you're using (4.8.0) is not fully compatible with Ruby 3.0.0.

The issue is that Ruby 3.0.0 removed the `Module#ref` method which is used in Devise 4.8.0. This is why you're seeing the `undefined method 'reference' for ActiveSupport::Dependencies:Module (NoMethodError)` error.

To fix this issue, you have two options:

1. Downgrade your Ruby version to 2.7.x or lower. This can be done by modifying your `.ruby-version` file or through your version manager (like RVM or rbenv).

2. Upgrade your Devise gem to a version that supports Ruby 3.0.0. At the time of writing, Devise has not released a version that supports Ruby 3.0.0, but you can use the master branch from the GitHub repository which has the necessary fixes. You can do this by changing your Gemfile to:

```ruby
gem 'devise', github: 'heartcombo/devise'
```

Then run `bundle install` to install the gem from the GitHub repository.

Remember to always check the compatibility of your gems with your Ruby version to avoid these kinds of issues.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error you're encountering is due to a compatibility issue between Devise and Ruby 3.0.0. The method `Module#ref` has been removed in Ruby 3.0.0, which is causing this error. 

Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Ruby 3.0.0. You will need to use Devise 4.7.3 or lower, or wait until a new version of Devise is released that supports Ruby 3.0.0.

To resolve this issue, you can do the following:

1. Specify the version of Devise in your Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '4.7.3'
```

2. Run `bundle install` to install the specified version of Devise.

3. If you still encounter issues, you might need to downgrade your Ruby version to 2.7.2 or lower until Devise releases a version that is compatible with Ruby 3.0.0.

Remember to always check the compatibility of your gems with your current Ruby and Rails version to avoid such issues.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error you're seeing is due to an incompatibility between Devise and the version of Rails you're using. Devise 4.8.0 is not compatible with Rails 7.0.0 or Ruby 3.0.0.

To fix this issue, you can use the latest version of Devise that is compatible with Rails 7.0.0 and Ruby 3.0.0. At the time of writing, the compatible version of Devise is 4.8.1.

Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. Open your Gemfile and update the devise gem to the latest version:

```ruby
gem 'devise', '~> 4.8.1'
```

2. Run the bundle update command to update the gem:

```bash
bundle update devise
```

3. Restart your Rails server.

If you still encounter issues, please let me know.
