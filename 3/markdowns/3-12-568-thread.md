I am developing a Flutter app for academic purposes in university. Now, I need to run a sort of "always on" background service in order to use Bluetooth and most importantly to get periodic updates from external REST APIs.

I've already checked those two libraries from pub.dev ([this](https://pub.dev/packages/foreground_service) and [this](https://pub.dev/packages/background_fetch)) without finding the perfect solution that works out-of-the-box (as expected...). I also saw something native with Kotlin ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXuAzXY_KOo)). What I would to know is what is the best option in order to achieve my goals (in terms of best practices, completeness and with simplicity in mind).

Have a look at the following image for a more schematic view:

For this kind of things you have to rely on native mechanisms.

The most efficient way to deal with APIs in an "always existent" background component is to implement a push notification service. 
Using that kind of tech a remote server is capable of starting communication with your app, awaken it and then perform whatever task needs to be performed.

Also, in Android, you have [foreground services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/services#Types-of-services) which will run even if the app is closed.

You might want to have a look at [flutter_background_service](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_background_service) package. It helps executing Dart code in the background.

[Can I run Dart code in the background of an Flutter app?](https://flutter.io/faq/#can-i-run-dart-code-in-the-background-of-an-flutter-app)

> Yes, you can run Dart code in a background process on both iOS and Android. For more information, see the [Medium article Executing Dart in the Background with Flutter Plugins and Geofencing](https://medium.com/flutter/executing-dart-in-the-background-with-flutter-plugins-and-geofencing-2b3e40a1a124).

I recommend using [android_long_task](https://pub.dev/packages/android_long_task) plugin which has a good documentation
if you want to run a long running task using an Android Foreground Service and start to listen to the update and progress of your task running in the that service. also you can update the foreground service notification however you want.
