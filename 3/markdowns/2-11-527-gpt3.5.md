i am looking at this piece of code:
```
#include <chrono>
#include <iostream>
#include <map>
#include <mutex>
#include <shared_mutex>
#include <string>
#include <thread>

bool flag;
std::mutex m;

void wait_for_flag() {
  // std::cout << &m << std::endl;
  // return;
  std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lk(m);
  while (!flag) {
    lk.unlock();
    std::cout << "unlocked....." << std::endl;
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::milliseconds(100));
    std::cout << "sleeping....." << std::endl;
    lk.lock();
    std::cout << "locked by " << std::this_thread::get_id() << "....."
              << std::endl;
  }
}

int main(int argc, char const *argv[]) {
  std::thread t(wait_for_flag);
  std::thread t2(wait_for_flag);
  std::thread t3(wait_for_flag);
  std::thread t4(wait_for_flag);
  std::thread t5(wait_for_flag);

  t.join();
  t2.join();
  t3.join();
  t4.join();
  t5.join();

  return 0;
}
```

I am new to this, and I thought mutex can only be acquired by one thread. I got two questions:

1. why there is no deadlock among those threads, e.g. if thread A runs lk.unlock(), then thread B runs lk.lock() and then thread A runs lk.lock().
2. what does it mean we define a new unique_lock in every thread associating to the same mutex lock (which is called m in here)


Thanks

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

1. There is no deadlock among those threads because the `std::unique_lock` object `lk` is released before the thread goes to sleep. When a thread calls `lk.unlock()`, it releases the lock on the mutex `m`. This allows other threads to acquire the lock and continue executing. When the thread wakes up from sleep, it calls `lk.lock()` to reacquire the lock on the mutex `m`. If another thread has acquired the lock in the meantime, the thread will wait until the lock is released before it can acquire it again. This way, the threads take turns acquiring the lock and releasing it, without causing a deadlock.

2. Defining a new `std::unique_lock` object in every thread associating to the same mutex lock means that each thread has its own lock on the mutex. This is necessary because a mutex can only be locked by one thread at a time. When a thread acquires the lock on the mutex, it prevents other threads from accessing the shared resource protected by the mutex. By creating a new `std::unique_lock` object in each thread, each thread has its own lock on the mutex, allowing them to take turns accessing the shared resource without interfering with each other.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

1. There is no deadlock because the `std::unique_lock` is being used correctly. When a thread calls `lk.unlock()`, it releases the lock on the mutex, allowing other threads to acquire the lock. In this case, when thread A runs `lk.unlock()`, it releases the lock and thread B can acquire the lock by calling `lk.lock()`. When thread A tries to acquire the lock again by calling `lk.lock()`, it will wait until the lock is released by thread B. This is called a "blocking lock" and it ensures that only one thread can hold the lock at a time.

2. Defining a new `std::unique_lock` in every thread associating to the same mutex lock means that each thread has its own lock on the mutex. This is useful because it allows each thread to release the lock when it is not needed, allowing other threads to acquire the lock. If all threads were using the same `std::unique_lock`, they would all be waiting for each other to release the lock, causing a deadlock. By using separate locks, each thread can release the lock when it is done with it, allowing other threads to acquire the lock and continue executing.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

1. There is no deadlock because the `std::unique_lock` object `lk` is being unlocked before sleeping and then locked again before checking the flag. This allows other threads to acquire the lock and continue execution while the current thread is sleeping. When the current thread wakes up, it tries to acquire the lock again before checking the flag. If the lock is already acquired by another thread, the current thread will wait until the lock is released by the other thread. This way, all threads can take turns acquiring the lock and checking the flag without causing a deadlock.

2. Defining a new `std::unique_lock` object in every thread associated with the same mutex lock allows each thread to acquire and release the lock independently. This is useful in situations where multiple threads need to access a shared resource, but only one thread should access the resource at a time. By using a mutex lock and `std::unique_lock` objects, each thread can acquire the lock when it needs to access the shared resource and release the lock when it is done, allowing other threads to access the resource in turn.
