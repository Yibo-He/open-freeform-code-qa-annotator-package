```
if (1) int a = 2;
```

This line of code is valid C++ code (it compiles at the very least) yet invalid C code (doesn't compile). I know there are differences between the languages but this one was unexpected.
I always thought the grammar was
```
if (expr) statement
```

but this would make it valid in both.
My questions are:

1. Why doesn't this compile in C?
2. Why does this difference exist?

1. Why doesn't this compile in C?

The code snippet you provided doesn't compile in C because C does not allow variable declarations to occur within the condition of an `if` statement. In C, all variables must be declared at the beginning of a block (a section of code enclosed in `{}`), before any executable statements.

In your code, `int a = 2;` is a declaration statement, which is not allowed in the conditional part of an `if` statement in C.

2. Why does this difference exist?

This difference exists due to the evolution of the two languages and their different design philosophies. 

C++ was designed to be more flexible and to support a wider range of programming styles than C. One of the ways it achieves this is by allowing variable declarations to occur almost anywhere, not just at the start of a block. This includes within the condition of an `if` statement.

In contrast, C was designed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency. Requiring all variables to be declared at the start of a block makes the language simpler and easier to implement, but it also makes the language less flexible.

So, in summary, this difference exists because C++ chose to prioritize flexibility and expressiveness, while C chose to prioritize simplicity and efficiency.

1. Why doesn't this compile in C?

The reason why this doesn't compile in C is due to the fact that C requires all variables to be declared at the beginning of a block (a block is a piece of code enclosed in braces `{}`). In your code, you're trying to declare a variable `a` in the middle of an `if` statement, which is not allowed in C.

2. Why does this difference exist?

This difference exists due to the evolution of the C++ language. In C++, variables can be declared almost anywhere, not just at the beginning of a block. This is a feature that was added to C++ to make it more flexible and easier to use than C in certain situations. 

In C++, the line `if (1) int a = 2;` is valid because it's equivalent to:

```cpp
if (1) {
    int a = 2;
}
```

This is a block with a single statement, and `a` is declared at the beginning of it. However, the scope of `a` is limited to this block, so it can't be used outside of it.

This difference is one of many that exist between C and C++, even though C++ was originally based on C. Over time, C++ has added many features that are not present in C, and this is one of them.

1. Why doesn't this compile in C?

The code doesn't compile in C because C requires that variables be declared at the beginning of a block (a section of code enclosed in braces `{}`). In your code, you're trying to declare a variable `a` in the middle of an `if` statement, which is not a block. This is not allowed in C.

2. Why does this difference exist?

The difference exists because C++ has more relaxed rules about where variables can be declared compared to C. In C++, you can declare a variable at the point of first use, which can be in the middle of a block or a conditional statement like an `if` statement. This is not allowed in C.

This difference is one of many that exist between C and C++ due to the evolution of the languages. C++ was originally developed as an extension of C with additional features like classes and objects for object-oriented programming. Over time, other features and changes were added to C++ that are not present in C, including the ability to declare variables at the point of first use.
