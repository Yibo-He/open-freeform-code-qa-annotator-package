I am using row widget with three child widgets:
Text
Icon
Text

I want all of them to appear in single line same level horizontally  and drop to new line if text increases.

I am using below code for Row widget but last Text widget is not aligned correctly
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/R1eeS.png)

The text dropping should start below the "`Tap`" and "`on the right hand`" is not aligned

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Expanded(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can achieve the desired layout by wrapping the second and third child widgets in a `Flexible` widget instead of an `Expanded` widget. Here's the updated code:

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Flexible(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

By using `Flexible` instead of `Expanded`, the second and third child widgets will take up only as much space as they need, allowing them to be aligned correctly with the first child widget. If the text in the third child widget exceeds the available space, it will wrap to the next line.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can achieve the desired layout by wrapping the second Text widget with a Flexible widget instead of an Expanded widget. The Flexible widget will allow the second Text widget to wrap to the next line if the text is too long, while keeping the alignment of the first Text widget and the Icon widget intact.

Here's the updated code:

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Flexible(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

This should give you the desired layout where all the widgets appear in a single line and the second Text widget wraps to the next line if the text is too long.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can achieve this by wrapping the second and third Text widgets in a Flexible widget instead of Expanded widget. Here's the updated code:

```
Row(
  mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.start,
  mainAxisSize: MainAxisSize.min,
  children: <Widget>[
    Text(
      'Tap ',
      style: TextStyle(
        fontSize: 17,
      ),
    ),
    Icon(Icons.add),
    Flexible(
      child: Text(
        'on the right hand corner to start a new chat.',
        style: TextStyle(
          fontSize: 17,
        ),
      ),
    )
  ],
)
```

By using Flexible widget, the second and third Text widgets will take up as much space as they need and will not overflow the Row widget. This will ensure that all the widgets are aligned correctly and appear in a single line.
