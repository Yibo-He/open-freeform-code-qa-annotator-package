## What is the idiomatic way to do something when an Option is either None, or the inner value meets some condition?

Is there a more idiomatic way to express something like the following?
```
fn main() {
    let mut foo: Option<u8> = None;
    match foo {
        Some(foo_val) if ! (foo_val < 5) /* i.e. the negation of my acceptance condition */ => {}
        _ => { foo.replace(5); }
    }
}
```

It seems like most of the time there's an alternative to having an arm that doesn't do anything, but I've been unable to find one for this particular case.
What I'd like to say is the more direct `if foo.is_none() || /* some way to extract and test the inner value */ { ... }`, or perhaps some chaining trick that's eluding me.

The [matches!](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/macro.matches.html) macro seems like a good fit:
```
if !matches!(foo, Some(a) if a>=5) { foo.replace(5) }
```

```
//        in None case
//             │       in Some(_) case
//            ┌┴─┐  ┌───────────────────┐    
if foo.map_or(true, |foo_val| foo_val < 5) {
    // ...
}
```

There are many ways to do it. One of the simplest (and arguably most readable) is something like this:
```
if foo.unwrap_or(0) < 5 {
    ...
}
```

The above will be true in both cases:
- `foo``Some``5`- `foo``None`
In some more complex scenarios, where the "default" value needs to be calculated and performance is critical, you might want to consider [unwrap_or_else](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.unwrap_or_else).
As Lukas suggested, the [map_or](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.map_or) method can also be used. Note that arguments passed to `map_or` are eagerly evaluated, so if performance is critical, you might want to consider [map_or_else](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.map_or_else) as an alternative.

You can do it with [filter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.filter) (using the negation of your condition) and [is_none](https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.54.0/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.is_none):
```
if foo.filter(|&x| !(x < 5)).is_none() {
    // Here either foo was None or it contained a value less than 5
}
```

I'm not sure I completely understand your question but you can try something like that:
```
fn main() {
    let foo: Option<u8> = None;
    let result = foo.filter(|foo_val| !(*foo_val < 5) ).unwrap_or(5);
    println!("Result: {result}");
}
```

I'll throw in another solution just for fun....
```
foo = foo.
    or(Some(5)). // if None return Some(5)
    map(|x| if x<5 { 5 } else { x });
```

or (for this specific example)
```
foo = foo.
    or(Some(5)). // if None return Some(5)
    map(|x| u8::max(x, 5));
```

With `filter` and `or`,
```
foo = foo.filter(|a|  *a >= 5)
                .or(Some(5));
```

There is the unstable method [Option::is_some_and](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/option/enum.Option.html#method.is_some_and) that has been built for exactly this purpose:
```
if foo.is_some_and(|foo_val| foo_val < 5) { 
    // ...
}
```

As it's unstable, it's currently only usable on nightly. See the [tracking issue](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/93050) for up to date information.
