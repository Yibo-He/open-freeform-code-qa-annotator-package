This issue might be due to several reasons such as a network problem, a problem with the Flutter SDK, or an issue with Android Studio itself. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Restart Android Studio**: Sometimes, simply restarting Android Studio can solve the problem.

2. **Update Flutter and Dart plugins**: Make sure you have the latest versions of Flutter and Dart plugins. You can check this by going to `File > Settings > Plugins` in Android Studio.

3. **Update Flutter SDK**: Open your terminal and run `flutter upgrade` to make sure you have the latest version of Flutter SDK.

4. **Check your internet connection**: The Flutter Inspector needs to download the DevTools package from the internet. Make sure your internet connection is stable.

5. **Manually install Flutter DevTools**: You can try to manually install Flutter DevTools by running `flutter pub global activate devtools` in your terminal. After that, you can start DevTools by running `flutter pub global run devtools`.

6. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above solutions work, you might need to reinstall Android Studio.

Remember to restart your IDE after each step to check if the problem is solved.

This issue might be due to several reasons such as a problem with the Flutter SDK, Android Studio, or the Dart plugin. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Flutter SDK and Dart Plugin**: Make sure you have the latest version of Flutter SDK and Dart plugin. You can update Flutter SDK by running `flutter upgrade` in your terminal and Dart plugin can be updated from Android Studio (Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins`).

2. **Reinstall Flutter and Dart Plugin**: If updating doesn't work, try reinstalling Flutter SDK and Dart plugin. Uninstall them first and then install again.

3. **Invalidate Caches / Restart**: Sometimes, Android Studio might have cached some data that could cause problems. Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart` in Android Studio.

4. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` in your terminal. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. It might show some issues that you need to fix.

5. **Reinstall Android Studio**: If none of the above solutions work, you might need to reinstall Android Studio. Uninstall it first, then download the latest version from the official website and install it.

Remember to backup your projects before reinstalling any software.

4. **Restart Android Studio**: Try closing and reopening Android Studio. Sometimes, a simple restart can fix many issues.

5. **Reinstall DevTools**: You can try reinstalling DevTools by running `flutter pub global activate devtools` in your terminal.

6. **Check for Firewall or Antivirus Interference**: Sometimes, your system's firewall or antivirus software might interfere with the installation of DevTools. Make sure to add an exception for Android Studio in your firewall or antivirus settings.
