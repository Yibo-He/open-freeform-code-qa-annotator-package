The error message indicates that you're trying to send a body with a content type of "application/json", but the body is not in the correct format. When you're sending JSON data, the body should be a JSON string, not a Map.

You can use `jsonEncode` function from `dart:convert` to convert your Map to a JSON string. Here's how you can do it:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

Map<String, String> body = {
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
};

var response = await post(Urls.getToken,
    headers: headers,
    body: jsonEncode(body), // Convert body to JSON string
);
```

This should solve your problem.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a JSON body with a POST request, but the body is not properly formatted as JSON. 

In Dart, when you're sending JSON data, you need to encode it using `json.encode()`. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = json.encode({
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
});

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: body,
);
```

This will convert your Dart map into a JSON string, which can then be sent in the body of your POST request.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is indicating that you're trying to send a `Map` directly as the body of a `POST` request with `Content-Type` set to `application/json`. However, the `http` package doesn't automatically encode `Map` to a JSON string. You need to manually encode the `Map` to a JSON string using `jsonEncode` from `dart:convert`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'authorization':'Basic c3R1ZHlkb3RlOnN0dWR5ZG90ZTEyMw=='
};

var body = jsonEncode({
  "grant_type":"password",
  "username":"******",
  "password":"*****",
  "scope":"offline_access"
});

var response = await post(
  Urls.getToken,
  headers: headers,
  body: body,
);
```

This should resolve the error you're facing.
