I'm using JSON file and register in `Pubspec.ymal` but showing error and also when I use an image and register it, the same error also occurs. Maybe there is a formatting mistake in it, but don't know what the problem is.this is the [doc](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec) I followed.

This is my `pubspec.yaml` file

```
name: jsondata description: A new Flutter application.

  dependencies:  

  flutter:

  sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

  dev_dependencies:   

 flutter_test:

      sdk: flutter

    flutter:

    uses-material-design: true

      assets:

       - loadjson/person.json
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It looks like there is a formatting mistake in your `pubspec.yaml` file. The `assets` section should be indented under the `flutter` section, like this:

```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

Make sure there are no extra spaces or tabs in this section. Also, make sure that the path to your JSON file is correct and that the file is located in the `loadjson` directory in your project.

If you are still having issues, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter pub get` in your terminal to clear any cached dependencies and rebuild your project.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The formatting of your `pubspec.yaml` file seems to be incorrect. Here's the corrected version:

```
name: jsondata 
description: A new Flutter application.

dependencies:  
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

dev_dependencies:   
  flutter_test:
    sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

Make sure to follow the indentation and spacing as shown above. Also, ensure that the `loadjson` folder containing the `person.json` file is in the root directory of your project.
