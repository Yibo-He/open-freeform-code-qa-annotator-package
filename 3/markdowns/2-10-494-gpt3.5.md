I'm using rust-analyzer version 0.2.408 on Visual Studio Code.
I'm writing a command line application that involves centering text in the terminal. This is the function I wrote to do this:
```
use console::{Alignment, pad_str};

fn get_padded_row(row: &str, width: u16, symbol: Option<char>) -> String {
    let symbol = symbol.unwrap_or(' ');
    return pad_str(row, width as usize, Alignment::Center, None)
        .to_string()
        .replace(' ', &symbol.to_string());
}
```

This function works perfectly fine, and there were no errors with it. Then I wrote a test:
```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::get_padded_row;

    #[test]
    fn row_padding_dashes() {
        let padded_row = get_padded_row("hello", 15, Some('-'));
        assert_eq!(
            padded_row, "-----hello-----".to_string(),
            "`get_padded_row` was not correct, got `{}`", padded_row
        );
    }
}
```

The code still works perfectly fine. Both `cargo run` and `cargo test` work, the function passes the test, and `cargo check` returns no issues. But rust-analyzer gives an error, highlighting everything from the `tr};` in the `use` statement to the `p` right after `return`: "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args` rust-analyzer(macro-error)". Searching for this error returns nothing. VSCode links me to [rust-analyzer user manual](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#macro-error), which says only "This diagnostic is shown for macro expansion errors". Restarting VSCode and reinstalling rust-analyzer have done nothing. The error always comes back, and highlighting the same oddly specific region. The only way I've found to get rid of it while keeping rust-analyzer installed is to remove the test.
Judging from how the error is about macro expansion, and how removing the test fixes the issue, I'd imagine it's caused by the `#[test]` macro, but it's strange that rustc finds no issues at all with my code while rust-analyzer is freaking out about this error. So far, I've had better experiences with rust-analyzer than with the official Rust VSCode extension, but I'm on the verge of switching back to fix this issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like this error is a false positive from rust-analyzer. The `#[test]` macro is a built-in Rust macro, and it's unlikely that there's an issue with it. It's possible that rust-analyzer is having trouble resolving the macro due to a bug or a configuration issue.

One thing you can try is to update rust-analyzer to the latest version. You can do this by running `rustup update` and then restarting VSCode. If that doesn't work, you can try disabling rust-analyzer and using the official Rust VSCode extension instead.

To disable rust-analyzer, go to your VSCode settings and search for "rust-analyzer.enable". Set the value to false, and then restart VSCode. This will disable rust-analyzer and use the official Rust VSCode extension instead.

If you still encounter issues, you can try posting on the rust-analyzer GitHub repository or the Rust subreddit for further assistance.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like this is a known issue with rust-analyzer. There are a few things you can try to resolve this:

1. Update rust-analyzer to the latest version. This issue may have been fixed in a more recent release.

2. Try disabling the "rust-analyzer.enableCargoWatch" setting in VSCode. This may help resolve the issue.

3. If neither of the above solutions work, you can try using the official Rust VSCode extension instead of rust-analyzer. While rust-analyzer is generally more performant, the official extension may be more stable in some cases.

In any case, it's always a good idea to report issues like this to the rust-analyzer team so they can work on fixing them. You can do this by opening an issue on their GitHub repository.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like this is a known issue with rust-analyzer. There are a few things you can try to work around it:

1. Update rust-analyzer to the latest version. This issue may have been fixed in a more recent release.

2. Try using the `#[cfg(test)]` attribute on the function itself instead of on the module. This may help rust-analyzer better understand the macro expansion.

3. Use the `#[allow(unused_macros)]` attribute on the module. This will suppress the error, but it's not a great solution as it may hide other macro expansion errors.

4. Use the Rust VSCode extension instead of rust-analyzer. While you've had better experiences with rust-analyzer, the official extension may not have this issue.

I hope one of these solutions works for you!
