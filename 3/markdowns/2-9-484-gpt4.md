So what I want is to get n characters until it hits a specific character.
i have this String :
```
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'
```

How can I make it to only get to the character | , but without getting that character,
and get it like this:
```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the '|' character and then just select the first part. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_string = a.split('|')

# Get the first part
first_part = split_string[0]

print(first_part)
```

When you run this code, it will print:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The split is done at the specified separator. In this case, the separator is '|'. After the split, the first part of the string is the first item in the list, which is what you want.

You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the specified character. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_a = a.split('|')

# Get the first part
first_part = split_a[0]

print(first_part)
```

This will output:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

The `split()` function splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. In this case, it splits the string at each '|' character. The first item in the list (index 0) is the part of the string before the first '|'.

You can use the `split()` function in Python to split the string at the '|' character and then get the first element of the resulting list. Here is how you can do it:

```python
a='2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908|3.132087902867818,42.028314077306646|-0.07934861041448178,41.647538468746916|-0.07948265046522918,41.64754863599606'

# Split the string at '|'
split_string = a.split('|')

# Get the first element
first_element = split_string[0]

print(first_element)
```

This will output:

```
2.452811139617034,42.10874821716908
```

This code works by splitting the string into a list of substrings each time it encounters the '|' character. The `split()` function returns a list of all the substrings. The first element of this list (index 0) is the substring before the first '|'.
