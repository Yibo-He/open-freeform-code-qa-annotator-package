So in C++ there is now make_from_tuple as:
```
T obj = std::make_from_tuple<T>( { Args... args } ); // args represents a tuple
```

but how would one do:
```
T* obj = std::make_new_from_tuple<T*>( { Args... args } );
```

There is make_shared and make_unique but neither of those takes a tuple (and I'm not sure how one would extract the arguments from the tuple if that is the direction to go, as you can always make_unique then release if you want the raw pointer).
Very simple example 1:
```
struct A
{
    int i_; double d_; std::string s_;

    A( int i, double d, const std::string& s ) : i_(i), d_(d), s_(s) {}
};

auto aTuple = std::make_tuple( 1, 1.5, std::string("Hello") );
```

For a more complex example, if the tuple contains a unique_ptr you want to forward, I will want that to work too.

In C++, you can use `std::apply` to apply a function to a tuple's elements as arguments. Here's how you can use it to create a new object from a tuple:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Tuple>
T* make_new_from_tuple(Tuple&& t)
{
    return std::apply([](auto&&... args) {
        return new T(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...);
    }, std::forward<Tuple>(t));
}
```

In this function, `std::apply` is used to call a lambda function that creates a new `T` object with the tuple's elements as arguments. The `std::forward` function is used to preserve the value category (lvalue or rvalue) of the tuple's elements.

Here's how you can use this function with your `A` struct:

```cpp
auto aTuple = std::make_tuple(1, 1.5, std::string("Hello"));
A* a = make_new_from_tuple<A>(std::move(aTuple));
```

This will create a new `A` object with the values `(1, 1.5, "Hello")`.

If your tuple contains a `std::unique_ptr`, you can still use this function. The `std::forward` function will ensure that the `std::unique_ptr` is moved correctly. However, you need to make sure that the tuple is an rvalue (either a temporary or moved lvalue), because you can't copy a `std::unique_ptr`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use `std::apply` to create an object from a tuple of arguments. `std::apply` takes a callable and a tuple, and applies the callable to the elements of the tuple.

Here's how you can use it to create a new object on the heap:

```cpp
#include <tuple>
#include <memory>

template <typename T, typename Tuple>
T* make_new_from_tuple(Tuple&& t)
{
    return std::apply([](auto&&... args){
        return new T(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...);
    }, std::forward<Tuple>(t));
}

struct A
{
    int i_; double d_; std::string s_;

    A( int i, double d, const std::string& s ) : i_(i), d_(d), s_(s) {}
};

int main()
{
    auto aTuple = std::make_tuple( 1, 1.5, std::string("Hello") );
    A* a = make_new_from_tuple<A>(std::move(aTuple));
    // don't forget to delete a when you're done with it
}
```

This will work with any tuple, as long as its elements can be used as arguments to the constructor of `T`. If the tuple contains a `unique_ptr`, it will be moved into the new object.

Note that this function returns a raw pointer. You are responsible for deleting the object when you're done with it. If you forget, you will have a memory leak. Consider using a smart pointer like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage the memory automatically.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can create a helper function that uses `std::apply` to call the constructor of `T` with the arguments from the tuple. Here's how you can do it:

```cpp
template <typename T, typename Tuple>
T* make_new_from_tuple(Tuple&& t) {
    return std::apply([](auto&&... args) {
        return new T(std::forward<decltype(args)>(args)...);
    }, std::forward<Tuple>(t));
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```cpp
auto aTuple = std::make_tuple(1, 1.5, std::string("Hello"));
A* a = make_new_from_tuple<A>(std::move(aTuple));
```

This function will work with any tuple, as long as its elements can be used as arguments to the constructor of `T`. This includes tuples that contain `std::unique_ptr`, as long as the constructor of `T` accepts `std::unique_ptr` arguments.
