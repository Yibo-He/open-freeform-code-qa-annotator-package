I'm using JSON file and register in `Pubspec.ymal` but showing error and also when I use an image and register it, the same error also occurs. Maybe there is a formatting mistake in it, but don't know what the problem is.this is the [doc](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/pub/pubspec) I followed.

This is my `pubspec.yaml` file

```
name: jsondata description: A new Flutter application.

  dependencies:  

  flutter:

  sdk: flutter

  cupertino_icons: ^0.1.0

  dev_dependencies:   

 flutter_test:

      sdk: flutter

    flutter:

    uses-material-design: true

      assets:

       - loadjson/person.json
```

Spaces are significant in YAML

`assets` is indented too far

```
flutter_test:
  sdk: flutter

flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - loadjson/person.json
```

It is because of the indentation of your code.The `uses-material-design` should be on the same line vertically as the `assets:`.

```
uses-material-design: true

 assets:
   - images/picture.png
```

> Error on line 29, column 4: Expected a key while parsing a block
  mapping.    assets: flutter:   uses-material-design: true    assets: 
      - assets/images/image.jpg

In my case i just added `#` in front of `uses-material-design: true`

Try below code

```
flutter:   

  # uses-material-design: true 

   assets: 
    - assets/images/image.jpg
```


its working fine.

In my case, `uses-material-design` indentation was broken. I put 1 (one) more space before it, and it worked fine.

With removed comments, original, generated by default pubspec.yaml looks like this

```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
   assets:
    - images/abc.jpg
```


But it isn't vaild. It doesn't works. It should be:

```
flutter:
  uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - images/abc.jpg
```

Spaces are very important in .yaml file. 

Just make sure your code is on the same line (vertically) according to key and value.

Assets should be on the same line as uses-material-design:
```
uses-material-design: true
  assets:
    - images/myimage.jpg
```


- uses-material-design =  2 spaces- assets = 2 spaces- -images/  = 4 spaces- fonts: = 2 spaces- -family: = 4 spaces- fonts:  = 6 spaces- -asset: = 8 spaces

If `images` folder is next to `lib` folder, you need a `./`, because it is not on the same level as the `pubspec.yaml`, then, in `pubspec.yaml` uncomment:
```
assets:
- ./images/   //Watch for spaces and indentation!!
```

Now you can use them:
```
Image.asset(
          '../images/nature.png',
          width: 600,
          height: 240,
          fit: BoxFit.cover,
        ),
```

**Error on line 46, column 4: Expected a key while parsing a block mapping. assets:
flutter: uses-material-design: true assets: - assets/dhaka.jpg**
Make sure when you uncomment the line please check indentation.
if indentation is wrong it's going error.

Happy coding !!!

Get same problem after uncommenting `assets` and `image link sample` in .
If you faced problem with `assets`, like I was. Make sure that it starts with same column(starts with same indent as pre-defined property like  `uses-material-design`). After uncommenting in my case, their location was different.
After that, the problem was solved.

In My Case, the image was too large to load, decreasing dimension of image worked.

As `@Baftek` mentioned , just indent before  and press `Ctrl+Alt+l` (Intellij or Android Studio) to reformat file.

Issue is related with indent spacing, check your spacing, it should work fine
fonts:
    - family: CM Sans Serif
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/cm_sans_serif_2012.ttf

It is because Spaces are significant in YAML .The uses-material-design should be on the same line vertically as the assets:
It should be:
```
flutter:
 uses-material-design: true
 assets:
    - images/abc.jpg
```

If still you are getting error for line number same as assets. try  and .
