I came across [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71680246/how-to-make-a-function-call-to-a-constructor) where one of the user comment says:
> A constructor , it is . It is invoked automatically when a new object is created.
My question is that is the above comment true/correct? If yes, then why isn't a constructor considered a function and why can't we call it?

Yes, the comment is correct. A constructor is a special method in a class in object-oriented programming. It is automatically called when an object of that class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object.

However, a constructor is not a regular function that you can call whenever you want. It is a special type of function that is only called once, at the moment of creating an object. Its name is the same as the class name and it doesn't have a return type.

The reason why we can't call a constructor like a regular function is because of the way object-oriented programming languages are designed. The constructor's role is to ensure that an object is in a valid state when it's created. If we could call it like a regular function, we could potentially put the object in an invalid state by reinitializing it, which would break the encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming.

In some languages like C++, you can call a constructor explicitly, but this is generally considered bad practice and can lead to undefined behavior. In other languages like Java or C#, you can't call a constructor directly after the object has been created.

Yes, the comment is correct. A constructor is a special type of method in object-oriented programming that is automatically invoked when an object of a class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object.

However, a constructor is not a regular function that you can call whenever you want. It's a special method with a specific purpose and usage rules. Here are some reasons why a constructor isn't considered a regular function:

1. **Invocation Time**: Regular functions can be called whenever needed, but a constructor is automatically called when an object is created. You don't explicitly call a constructor function after the object has been created.

2. **Name**: A constructor has the same name as the class. This is a requirement and it differentiates it from regular functions.

3. **No Return Type**: Constructors do not have a return type, not even void. This is different from regular functions which need a return type.

4. **Automatic Call**: You cannot prevent a constructor from being called when an object is created. This is not the case with regular functions, which are only called when explicitly invoked.

5. **Purpose**: The main purpose of a constructor is to initialize the object's properties. A function, on the other hand, is used to perform a specific task.

So, while a constructor is a type of method or function, it has specific rules and characteristics that differentiate it from regular functions.

Yes, the comment is correct. A constructor is a special method in a class in object-oriented programming. It is automatically invoked when an object of the class is created. Its main purpose is to initialize the object's properties.

However, a constructor is not a regular function that you can call whenever you want. It's a special type of function that is only called once, at the moment of creating an object.

The reason why we can't call a constructor like a normal function is because of the way object-oriented programming languages are designed. The purpose of a constructor is to initialize an object's state. If we were able to call a constructor like a normal function, it could lead to reinitializing an object's state in a way that is inconsistent or unexpected, which could lead to bugs or other issues in the code.

In some languages like JavaScript, you can call a constructor directly using the `new` keyword, but this is not the same as calling a regular function. When you use the `new` keyword, JavaScript creates a new object, then calls the constructor to initialize it. This is different from calling a regular function, which doesn't create a new object.
