I'm trying to create a ListView but when I import the list_form.dart class i get this error. Maybe I made some mistakes with the layout because if I try to run it inside the main file I don't get this error.

This is the error:

```

Don't worry if there is some unused code, it's a work in progress and this error just stopped me continuing what I was doing.

The problem is that you are placing the `ListView` inside a Column/Row. The text in the exception gives a good explanation of the error.

To avoid the error you need to provide a size to the `ListView` inside.

I propose you this code that uses an `Expanded` to inform the horizontal size (maximum available) and the `SizedBox` (Could be a Container) for the `height:`

```
new Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        Expanded(
          child: SizedBox(
            height: 200.0,
            child: new ListView.builder(
              scrollDirection: Axis.horizontal,
              itemCount: products.length,
              itemBuilder: (BuildContext ctxt, int index) {
                return new Text(products[index]);
              },
            ),
          ),
        ),
        new IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.remove_circle),
          onPressed: () {},
        ),
      ],
      mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    )
```

You can add some code like this 

```
ListView.builder{
   shrinkWrap: true,
}
```

`Column` tries to expands in vertical axis, and so does the `ListView`, hence you need to constrain the height of `ListView`.  


---






1. Use either Expanded or Flexible if you want to allow ListView to take up entire left space in Column. Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    Expanded(
      child: ListView(...),
    )
  ],
)




---




1. Use SizedBox if you want to restrict the size of ListView to a certain height. Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    SizedBox(
      height: 200, // constrain height
      child: ListView(),
    )
  ],
)




---




1. Use shrinkWrap, if your ListView isn't too big. Column(
  children: <Widget>[
    ListView(
      shrinkWrap: true, // use it
    )
  ],
)

use `shrinkWrap: true`,
With shrinkWrap: true, you can change this behavior so that the ListView only occupies the space it needs (it will still scroll when there more items).
If you set it to true, the list will wrap its content and be as big as it children allows it to be.
like this.
```
ListView.builder(
        shrinkWrap: true,

Placing your list view in a Flexible widget may also help,

```
Flexible( fit: FlexFit.tight, child: _buildYourListWidget(..),)
```

```
Expanded(child:MyListView())
```

I had a similir problem, but in my case, I put a row in the leading of the ListView, and it was consuming all the space, of course. I just had to take the Row out of the leading, and it was solved. I would recommend to check if the problem is a larger widget than its container can have.
```
Expanded(child:MyListView())
```

My app started crashing with the same error just completely out of the blue.
I really appreciate the other answers mentioned here on this page. But none  worked for me. I was on Flutter 2.0.0 and upgrading to Flutter 2.2.2 fixed the issue without changing anything in my existing code.

Expanded widget will fix that problem, mainly that error occurs when you user multiples widgets with dynamic sizes in a column or a row

You can Always resolve this error in one of the following three ways:

1. Wrap your ListView with Expanded widget.
2. Wrap your ListView with SizedBox and give it a specific height.
3. You can add below your listView this line: shrinkWrap: true,

In the case where you are using a Column/Row ensure to specify the size they should occupy e.g.
```
SizedBox(
  height: 100,
  child: Column(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.center,
    crossAxisAlignment: CrossAxisAlignment.center,
    children: const [
      CircularProgressIndicator(),
      SizedBox(
         width: 15,
       ),
       Expanded(
         child: Text("Data Laoding"),
       )
     ],
  ),
),
```

See, wrap with expanded, no matter of anything.
Flexible widget also sometimes doesn't works.
Hope, this will be helpful.
Rendering,
Parent widget error,
Assertion are basic errors.
This will catch fears in a programmer.

I had similar issue, I was using an SvgPicture widget inside a SizedBox widget and instead of specifying the height property in the SizedBox I did it inside the SvgPicture widget.
If that is your case, then I recommend you specify the height of the SizedBox.

Wrap the list view inside a  and specify the .
```
Column(
  children: [
    Container(
      width: MediaQuery.of(context).size.width,
      child: ListView.builder(..)
```

This will solve the issue.
