```
var textSize = 10.0;

into `Text` Widget of Flutter 

```
child: const Text('Calculate Client Fees',
                   style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```


Here it is giving error 

> Invalid Constant Value

Do we have to compulsory use `const` value? Why can not we use `var` or `double`?

You are declaring your `Text` widget as a `const`, which requires all of its children to be `const` as well. If you want to fix this, you should not use a `const` `Text` widget in this case as you want to pass a non-const variable.

The reason for this is that Flutter uses the `const` keyword as an idicator for a widget to  rebuild as it will get evaluated at compile time and . Hence, every part of it has to be constant as well.

```
double textSize = 10.04;
// ...
child: Text('Calculate Client Fees', style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize))
```

Don't use the  keyword if you are not using fixed values.
For example, in the case of `Text`, if its string is constant like `Text("something here")` then we should use the `const` but if the string of `Text` is dynamic then don't use const before `Text` widget.
`const Text("something")` and `Text(anyVariabale)`
The same is the case for all widgets.

As [@creativecreatorormaybenot](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6509751) said you are using `const Text()` which is why you have to have a `const` value there. 
You can either use

```
const double textSize = 10.0;
```


or

```
const textSize = 10.0;
```

Just like this case. 

```
Padding(
  padding: const EdgeInsets.all(value), // this value has to be a `const` because our padding: is marked const
  child: Text("HI there"),
);


Padding(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(10), // any double value
  child: Text("HI there"),
);
```

In dart when you pass something as a parameter in a const constructor, the compiler makes sure that the value set as default is not changed during the execution of the code.
Hence, the Invalid constant value warning.
To resolve this issue you should remove the const keyword from the in front of the Text.

```
child: const Text('Calculate Client Fees',

```


should be:

```
child: Text('Calculate Client Fees',
                   style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```

You should remove the keywords 
When it is used, it put the widget into the cache.
And you can't wait for a value into your widget and put the widget again as a constance. When you want to do that, you should not put your widget constant.
So do that:
```
double textSize = 10.0;
child: Text('Calculate Client Fees', style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```

Sometimes this can be tricky because the `Text` widget might not be the one which is `const` (where the error is displayed), but maybe its parent widget is `const` or the parent of that parent widget, etc. In that case it could be surprising and not immediate to spot the solution. For example:
```
const PrefLabel(
        title: Text(
          preferenceOptionTitle,
          style: Get.textTheme.headline5!,
          maxLines: 3,
        ),
        subtitle: Text(preferenceOptionDescription),
      ),
```

In this case the `Text` is not marked with `const` because the `PrefLabel` is already `const`. The corrected one which passes linting: `const` is moved to the subtitle
```
PrefLabel(
        title: Text(
          preferenceOptionTitle,
          style: Get.textTheme.headline5!,
          maxLines: 3,
        ),
        subtitle: const Text(preferenceOptionDescription),
      ),
```

if you want to use the `var` or `double textSize = 10.0;` then the text widget must not be a const. remove the `const` before the Text() 

```
child: Text('Calculate Client Fees', style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```

The simplest solution is to Just remove the `const` keyword.
replace with:
```
child: const Text('Calculate Client Fees',
               style: TextStyle(fontSize: textSize),)
```
