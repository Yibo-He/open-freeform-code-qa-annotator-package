## Why do I get the error "there is no reactor running, must be called from the context of Tokio runtime" even though I have #[tokio::main]?

I'm following [the mdns Rust documentation](https://docs.rs/mdns/1.1.0/mdns/) and pasted the example code but it throws the following error:
```
thread 'main' panicked at 'there is no reactor running, must be called from the context of Tokio runtime'
```

Here's the code that I have:
```
use futures_util::{pin_mut, stream::StreamExt};
use mdns::{Error, Record, RecordKind};
use std::{net::IpAddr, time::Duration};

const SERVICE_NAME: &'static str = "_googlecast._tcp.local";

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Error> {
    // Iterate through responses from each Cast device, asking for new devices every 15s
    let stream = mdns::discover::all(SERVICE_NAME, Duration::from_secs(15))?.listen();
    pin_mut!(stream);

    while let Some(Ok(response)) = stream.next().await {
        let addr = response.records().filter_map(self::to_ip_addr).next();

        if let Some(addr) = addr {
            println!("found cast device at {}", addr);
        } else {
            println!("cast device does not advertise address");
        }
    }

    Ok(())
}

fn to_ip_addr(record: &Record) -> Option<IpAddr> {
    match record.kind {
        RecordKind::A(addr) => Some(addr.into()),
        RecordKind::AAAA(addr) => Some(addr.into()),
        _ => None,
    }
}
```

Dependencies:
```
[dependencies]
mdns = "1.1.0"
futures-util = "0.3.8"
tokio = { version = "0.3.3", features = ["full"] }
```

What am I missing? I tried looking online but haven't found how to create a reactor for this use case.

The error message you're seeing suggests that the code is trying to use async functionality outside of an async context. The `mdns::discover::all` function is asynchronous and needs to be run within a Tokio runtime.

The `#[tokio::main]` attribute you have on your `main` function should be setting up this runtime for you. However, there might be a version mismatch issue between the version of Tokio that `mdns` is using and the version you're using in your project.

The `mdns` crate version 1.1.0 depends on Tokio 0.2. So, you should use Tokio 0.2 in your project as well. 

Here's how you can modify your dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies]
mdns = "1.1.0"
futures-util = "0.3.8"
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

After changing the version, run `cargo update` to update your dependencies and then try running your program again.

The error message you're seeing is indicating that the code is trying to use async functionality outside of an async runtime. The Tokio runtime is not being initialized properly.

The issue is likely due to the version of `tokio` you're using. The `mdns` crate requires `tokio` version 0.2.x, but you're using version 0.3.3. 

Try changing your `tokio` dependency in your `Cargo.toml` to use version 0.2.x with the full feature set:

```toml
[dependencies]
mdns = "1.1.0"
futures-util = "0.3.8"
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

Then run `cargo update` to update your dependencies, and try running your code again. This should resolve the issue. 

If you still encounter the same error after making these changes, please let me know so I can help you troubleshoot further.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message you're seeing is because the `mdns` crate requires a Tokio runtime to be running, but the version of Tokio you're using (0.3.3) is not compatible with the `mdns` crate. The `mdns` crate is using Tokio 0.2.x internally, and Tokio does not guarantee compatibility between different minor versions.

You can solve this issue by downgrading your Tokio version to 0.2.x. Here's how you can do it:

1. Change your `Cargo.toml` to use Tokio 0.2.x:

```toml
[dependencies]
mdns = "1.1.0"
futures-util = "0.3.8"
tokio = { version = "0.2", features = ["full"] }
```

2. Run `cargo update` to update your dependencies.

3. Now, your code should work as expected.

Please note that downgrading the Tokio version might affect other parts of your application if they rely on features or fixes that were introduced in Tokio 0.3.x. If that's the case, you might need to look for a different mDNS library that supports Tokio 0.3.x, or consider running the mDNS code in a separate thread with its own Tokio 0.2.x runtime.
