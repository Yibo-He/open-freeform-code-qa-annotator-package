I am trying to run a flutter app I am writing on my device but when I try to run, I never get past the "assembleDebug" stage and get this message in the terminal:

```
Launching lib\main.dart on SM N950U in debug mode...

I have recently updated to gradle 6.0.1 (I assume I did that correctly but I am very new to all this) and there are no issues with flutter doctor.

Here is my project level build.gradle:

```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        classpath 'com.google.gms:google-services:4.3.3'
    }
}

allprojects {
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
}

rootProject.buildDir = '../build'
subprojects {
    project.buildDir = "${rootProject.buildDir}/${project.name}"
}
subprojects {
    project.evaluationDependsOn(':app')
}

task clean(type: Delete) {
    delete rootProject.buildDir
}
```


Here is the app level build.gradle:

```
def localProperties = new Properties()
def localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file('local.properties')
if (localPropertiesFile.exists()) {
    localPropertiesFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader ->
        localProperties.load(reader)
    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}

def flutterVersionCode = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionCode')
if (flutterVersionCode == null) {
    flutterVersionCode = '1'
}

def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
if (flutterVersionName == null) {
    flutterVersionName = '1.0'
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'kotlin-android'

android {

    sourceSets {

    }

    defaultConfig {
        // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
        applicationId "com.example.skypeclone1"
        minSdkVersion 16

        versionName flutterVersionName
        testInstrumentationRunner "android.support.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
        multiDexEnabled true
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
            // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
    }
}

flutter {
    source '../..'
}

Here are my Gradle wrapper properties in case they are also important.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. You have specified version 5.6.2 in your project level build.gradle file, but it seems that this version is not available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

To fix this issue, you can try updating the version of the Android Gradle plugin to a more recent version that is available in the repositories. You can do this by changing the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

to:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

This will update the Android Gradle plugin to version 4.1.0, which is the latest stable version at the time of writing. You can also check for the latest version of the plugin on the official Android Gradle plugin release notes page.

After making this change, you should sync your project with Gradle by clicking on the "Sync Now" button in Android Studio or running the "gradlew clean build" command in the terminal. This should download the required version of the Android Gradle plugin and allow you to build and run your app on your device.

The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. You have specified version 5.6.2 in your project level build.gradle file, but it seems that this version is not available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

To fix this issue, you can try updating the version of the Android Gradle plugin to a more recent version. You can do this by changing the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'

```

This will update the Android Gradle plugin to version 4.1.0, which should be available in the repositories that Gradle is searching.

After making this change, try running your app again and see if the issue is resolved. If you continue to experience issues, you may need to check your Gradle configuration and ensure that all required dependencies are properly configured.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message indicates that Gradle is unable to find the required version of the Android Gradle plugin. In your project level build.gradle file, you have specified the version of the Android Gradle plugin as 5.6.2, which is not the latest version.

To fix this issue, you can update the version of the Android Gradle plugin to the latest version, which is 4.1.0. To do this, replace the following line in your project level build.gradle file:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:5.6.2'
```

with:

```
classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
```

After making this change, sync your project with Gradle by clicking on the "Sync Now" button in the top right corner of Android Studio. Once the sync is complete, try running your app again.
