[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRIAc.png)

I'm very new to flutter so I couldn't figure it out.
I need a custom AppBar with drawer and actions but arranged like the image.

I tried a StackView in the title widget

```
appBar: AppBar(
    title: Stack(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          color: CustomColors.accentColor,
        ),
        Text(
          'Title',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
```


But I get something like this

Can someone help me out? Thank you.

To achieve the desired layout, you can use a `Row` widget with three children: a `IconButton` for the drawer, a `Text` widget for the title, and a `Row` widget with the action buttons.

Here's an example code:

```
appBar: AppBar(
  backgroundColor: CustomColors.accentColor,
  elevation: 0,
  leading: IconButton(
    icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
    onPressed: () {},
  ),
  title: Text(
    'Title',
    style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
  ),
  actions: <Widget>[
    Row(
      children: <Widget>[
        IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.search),
          onPressed: () {},
        ),
        IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
          onPressed: () {},
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ],
),
```

In this code, we set the `backgroundColor` of the `AppBar` to the accent color and remove the elevation to achieve the desired look. The `leading` property is set to an `IconButton` with the drawer icon, and the `title` property is set to a `Text` widget with the title text. Finally, the `actions` property is set to a `Row` widget with two `IconButton` widgets for the search and notifications buttons.

To achieve the desired layout, you can use a Row widget as the title of the AppBar. Here's an example code:

```
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open drawer
        },
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open search screen
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

In this code, we have used a Row widget as the title of the AppBar. The `mainAxisAlignment` property of the Row widget is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to evenly distribute the child widgets along the horizontal axis. 

The first child of the Row widget is an IconButton with the menu icon. The `onPressed` property of the IconButton can be used to open the drawer.

The second child of the Row widget is a Text widget with the title of the screen.

The third child of the Row widget is an IconButton with the search icon. The `onPressed` property of the IconButton can be used to open the search screen.

You can customize the icons and their actions as per your requirements.

To achieve the desired layout, you can use a `Row` widget as the `title` of the `AppBar` and place the drawer icon and actions inside it. Here's an example code snippet:

```
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
        onPressed: () {
          // Open drawer
        },
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
      ),
      Row(
        children: <Widget>[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            onPressed: () {
              // Perform search
            },
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.notifications),
            onPressed: () {
              // Show notifications
            },
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

In this code, `mainAxisAlignment` is set to `MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to evenly distribute the drawer icon and actions on either side of the title. You can customize the icons and actions as per your requirements.
