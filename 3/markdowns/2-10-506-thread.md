I'm trying to display the minimum value within a vector in Rust and can't find a good way to do so.
Given a vector of `i32` :
```
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
```

My goal here is to get the minimum value of that vector without having to sort it.
What is the best way to get the minimum value within a `Vec<i32>` in Rust ?

```
let minValue = vec.iter().min();
match minValue {
    Some(min) => println!( "Min value: {}", min ),
    None      => println!( "Vector is empty" ),
}
```


[https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.min](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.min)

> ```
fn min(self) -> Option<Self::Item>
where
    Self::Item: Ord,
```
Returns the minimum element of an iterator.If several elements are equally minimum, the first element is returned. If the iterator is empty, None is returned.

I found this Gist which has some common C#/.NET Linq operations expressed in Swift and Rust, which is handy: [https://gist.github.com/leonardo-m/6e9315a57fe9caa893472c2935e9d589](https://gist.github.com/leonardo-m/6e9315a57fe9caa893472c2935e9d589)

```
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let minValue = *v.iter().min().unwrap();
```

Hi @octano As Dai has already answered, min/max return Option<> value, so you can only match it as in example:

```
fn main() {
    let vec_to_check = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
    let min_value = vec_to_check.iter().min();
    match min_value {
        None => println!("Min value was not found"),
        Some(i) => println!("Min Value = {}", i)
    }
}
```
