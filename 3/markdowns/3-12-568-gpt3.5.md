I am developing a Flutter app for academic purposes in university. Now, I need to run a sort of "always on" background service in order to use Bluetooth and most importantly to get periodic updates from external REST APIs.

I've already checked those two libraries from pub.dev ([this](https://pub.dev/packages/foreground_service) and [this](https://pub.dev/packages/background_fetch)) without finding the perfect solution that works out-of-the-box (as expected...). I also saw something native with Kotlin ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXuAzXY_KOo)). What I would to know is what is the best option in order to achieve my goals (in terms of best practices, completeness and with simplicity in mind).

Have a look at the following image for a more schematic view:

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

There are a few options you can consider for running a background service in your Flutter app:

1. Use the `flutter_background` plugin: This plugin provides a simple way to run a background service in your Flutter app. It supports both Android and iOS platforms and allows you to run your service even when the app is closed or the device is restarted.

2. Use the `flutter_isolate` plugin: This plugin allows you to run Dart code in a separate isolate (a lightweight thread) in your app. You can use this to run your background service and communicate with it from your main isolate using message passing.

3. Use native code: If you're comfortable with native development, you can write a background service using the native APIs for Android and iOS. This will give you more control over the behavior of your service, but will require more work to integrate with your Flutter app.

In terms of simplicity, the `flutter_background` plugin is probably the easiest to use, as it provides a high-level API for running a background service. However, if you need more control over the behavior of your service, you may want to consider using the `flutter_isolate` plugin or writing native code.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Based on your requirements, it seems like you need to implement a background service that can run indefinitely and fetch data from external REST APIs periodically. Here are some options you can consider:

1. WorkManager: WorkManager is an Android Jetpack library that provides a simple API to schedule background tasks. It can run tasks immediately or at a specific time, and it can also handle network connectivity changes. WorkManager is recommended by Google for most background tasks, and it's easy to use with Flutter using the `flutter_workmanager` package.

2. Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM): FCM is a cloud messaging service that allows you to send notifications and data messages to your app. You can use FCM to trigger background tasks in your app, even if it's not running. FCM is easy to integrate with Flutter using the `firebase_messaging` package.

3. AlarmManager: AlarmManager is an Android API that allows you to schedule tasks at specific times or intervals. It's a low-level API, but it's powerful and flexible. You can use AlarmManager to schedule periodic tasks in your app, and it's easy to use with Flutter using the `flutter_alarm_manager` package.

4. Isolate: Isolate is a Dart API that allows you to run code in a separate thread. You can use Isolate to run background tasks in your app, and it's easy to use with Flutter. However, Isolate doesn't provide any built-in scheduling or network connectivity features, so you'll need to implement those yourself.

Based on your requirements, I would recommend using WorkManager or FCM. WorkManager is a more modern and flexible API, while FCM is a simpler and more lightweight solution. Both options are well-supported and easy to use with Flutter.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Based on your requirements, it seems like you need to implement a background service that can run continuously and fetch data from external APIs periodically. Here are some options you can consider:

1. Flutter Isolate: Flutter provides an Isolate API that allows you to run code in a separate thread. You can use this API to create a background service that runs continuously and fetches data from external APIs. However, you need to be careful with memory management and ensure that your service does not consume too much memory.

2. Native Code: If you are comfortable with native code, you can use Kotlin or Java to create a background service that runs continuously and fetches data from external APIs. You can then use platform channels to communicate with your Flutter app.

3. Firebase Cloud Messaging: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) provides a way to send notifications to your app, even when it is in the background. You can use FCM to trigger your app to fetch data from external APIs periodically.

4. WorkManager: WorkManager is a library provided by Android that allows you to schedule background tasks. You can use WorkManager to schedule periodic tasks that fetch data from external APIs.

In terms of simplicity, using Flutter Isolate or WorkManager may be the easiest options. However, if you need more control over the background service, using native code may be the best option. Ultimately, the best option depends on your specific requirements and preferences.
