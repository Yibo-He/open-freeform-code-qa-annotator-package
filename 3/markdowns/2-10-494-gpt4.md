I'm using rust-analyzer version 0.2.408 on Visual Studio Code.
I'm writing a command line application that involves centering text in the terminal. This is the function I wrote to do this:
```
use console::{Alignment, pad_str};

fn get_padded_row(row: &str, width: u16, symbol: Option<char>) -> String {
    let symbol = symbol.unwrap_or(' ');
    return pad_str(row, width as usize, Alignment::Center, None)
        .to_string()
        .replace(' ', &symbol.to_string());
}
```

This function works perfectly fine, and there were no errors with it. Then I wrote a test:
```
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use crate::get_padded_row;

    #[test]
    fn row_padding_dashes() {
        let padded_row = get_padded_row("hello", 15, Some('-'));
        assert_eq!(
            padded_row, "-----hello-----".to_string(),
            "`get_padded_row` was not correct, got `{}`", padded_row
        );
    }
}
```

The code still works perfectly fine. Both `cargo run` and `cargo test` work, the function passes the test, and `cargo check` returns no issues. But rust-analyzer gives an error, highlighting everything from the `tr};` in the `use` statement to the `p` right after `return`: "could not resolve macro `$crate::format_args` rust-analyzer(macro-error)". Searching for this error returns nothing. VSCode links me to [rust-analyzer user manual](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#macro-error), which says only "This diagnostic is shown for macro expansion errors". Restarting VSCode and reinstalling rust-analyzer have done nothing. The error always comes back, and highlighting the same oddly specific region. The only way I've found to get rid of it while keeping rust-analyzer installed is to remove the test.
Judging from how the error is about macro expansion, and how removing the test fixes the issue, I'd imagine it's caused by the `#[test]` macro, but it's strange that rustc finds no issues at all with my code while rust-analyzer is freaking out about this error. So far, I've had better experiences with rust-analyzer than with the official Rust VSCode extension, but I'm on the verge of switching back to fix this issue.

This seems to be a known issue with rust-analyzer. It sometimes has trouble with macro expansion and can give false positives. The rust-analyzer team is actively working on improving macro support, but it's not perfect yet.

The good news is that if your code compiles and runs correctly, then it's likely that the problem is with rust-analyzer and not your code.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: Make sure you're using the latest version of rust-analyzer. The team is constantly making improvements, so updating might solve your problem.

2. **Check your Rust version**: Make sure you're using a recent stable version of Rust. Rust-analyzer might have trouble with older versions.

3. **Disable macro expansion**: As a last resort, you can disable macro expansion in rust-analyzer. This will stop it from trying to expand macros and should prevent the error. However, this will also disable some of rust-analyzer's features. You can disable macro expansion by adding the following to your settings.json file in VS Code:
    ```
    "rust-analyzer.procMacro.enable": false
    ```

Remember that rust-analyzer is a separate tool from the Rust compiler. While it's generally very good at catching errors, it's not perfect and can sometimes give false positives or negatives. If your code compiles and runs correctly, then you can usually trust that it's correct, even if rust-analyzer is showing an error.

This seems to be an issue with rust-analyzer itself. Rust-analyzer is a very useful tool, but it's not perfect and sometimes it can show errors that don't actually exist. This is especially true when it comes to macros, as the error message suggests.

If your code compiles and runs correctly, and the tests pass, then it's likely that the problem is with rust-analyzer and not your code. You can try to update rust-analyzer to the latest version, as the issue might have been fixed in a newer release.

If the issue persists, you can report it to the rust-analyzer team. They are very responsive and will be able to help you out. You can report issues on their GitHub page: https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues

In the meantime, if the error is too distracting, you can disable error highlighting in VSCode for rust-analyzer. To do this, go to the settings (File > Preferences > Settings or Ctrl+,), search for "rust-analyzer.diagnostics.enable" and uncheck the box.

Remember, this is just a workaround and not a solution. It's always better to report the issue so that it can be fixed in future versions of rust-analyzer.

Rust-analyzer is a very useful tool for Rust development, but it's not perfect and sometimes it may show false positives or negatives. It's important to remember that rust-analyzer and rustc (the official Rust compiler) are two different tools. Rust-analyzer aims to provide a rich IDE experience, while rustc is the official Rust compiler. They have different goals and sometimes their behavior may differ.

The error you're seeing seems to be a false positive from rust-analyzer. If your code compiles and passes tests with `cargo build` and `cargo test`, then it's likely that your code is fine.

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Update rust-analyzer**: Make sure you're using the latest version of rust-analyzer. The tool is under active development and bugs are fixed regularly.

2. **Check your Rust toolchain**: Make sure you're using the latest stable Rust toolchain. You can update your toolchain with `rustup update`.

3. **Check your project configuration**: Make sure your project is correctly configured for rust-analyzer. You can check the [rust-analyzer manual](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html) for more information on how to configure your project.

4. **Report the issue**: If none of the above solutions work, consider reporting the issue to the rust-analyzer team. They're very responsive and might be able to help you resolve the issue. You can report issues on the [rust-analyzer GitHub page](https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/issues).

Remember, if your code compiles and passes tests, then it's likely correct, even if rust-analyzer is showing an error.
