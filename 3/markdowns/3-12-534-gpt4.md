I can't wrap my head around using  for a single widget with provider? Suppose my widget is CurvedNavigationBar and I have 4 items in that widget. I also have 4 different classes that extend ChangeNotifier and 

? I looked at the documentation and could not found such an example.. is this even possible? I found that Consumer has a builder method, so that means you can build a widget  

Should I rather have a single class that extends ChangeNotifier and then update values in that widget and uses only a single Consumer to listen for updated values?

Yes, it's possible to use multiple `ChangeNotifier` providers for a single widget. However, it's also possible to use a single `ChangeNotifier` for managing multiple states. The choice depends on the complexity of your application and how you want to manage your states.

If your states are related and you want to manage them together, it's better to use a single `ChangeNotifier`. If your states are independent and you want to manage them separately, you can use multiple `ChangeNotifier` providers.

Here's an example of how you can use a single `ChangeNotifier` for your `CurvedNavigationBar`:

```dart
class NavigationModel extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  int get currentIndex => _currentIndex;

  set currentIndex(int index) {
    _currentIndex = index;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ChangeNotifierProvider(
      create: (context) => NavigationModel(),
      child: MaterialApp(
        home: Scaffold(
          body: Consumer<NavigationModel>(
            builder: (context, model, child) {
              return IndexedStack(
                index: model.currentIndex,
                children: <Widget>[
                  // Your 4 different classes here
                ],
              );
            },
          ),
          bottomNavigationBar: Consumer<NavigationModel>(
            builder: (context, model, child) {
              return CurvedNavigationBar(
                index: model.currentIndex,
                items: <Widget>[
                  // Your 4 items here
                ],
                onTap: (index) {
                  model.currentIndex = index;
                },
              );
            },
          ),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}
```

In this example, `NavigationModel` is a `ChangeNotifier` that manages the current index of the `CurvedNavigationBar`. `Consumer` is used to rebuild the `IndexedStack` and `CurvedNavigationBar` whenever the current index changes.

Yes, it is possible to use multiple ChangeNotifiers for a single widget. However, it's often more efficient and easier to manage if you have a single ChangeNotifier that manages all the state for a particular widget. 

In your case, you could have a single ChangeNotifier that manages the state of your CurvedNavigationBar. This ChangeNotifier could have a property for the currently selected index, and methods to update this index. 

Here's a simple example:

```dart
class NavigationBarNotifier extends ChangeNotifier {
  int _currentIndex = 0;

  int get currentIndex => _currentIndex;

  set currentIndex(int index) {
    _currentIndex = index;
    notifyListeners();
  }
}
```

Then, in your widget tree, you can provide this ChangeNotifier:

```dart
ChangeNotifierProvider(
  create: (context) => NavigationBarNotifier(),
  child: YourWidgetTree(),
)
```

And in your CurvedNavigationBar widget, you can use a Consumer to listen to changes:

```dart
Consumer<NavigationBarNotifier>(
  builder: (context, navigationBarNotifier, child) {
    return CurvedNavigationBar(
      index: navigationBarNotifier.currentIndex,
      items: <Widget>[
        // your items here
      ],
      onTap: (index) {
        navigationBarNotifier.currentIndex = index;
      },
    );
  },
)
```

This way, whenever the user taps on a different index in the navigation bar, the ChangeNotifier will update its state and notify all its listeners. The Consumer widget will rebuild, updating the CurvedNavigationBar with the new index.

This approach keeps all your state management for the navigation bar in one place, making it easier to manage and reason about.

Yes, it is possible to use multiple providers for a single widget. However, it's important to understand that the Provider pattern is used to manage state and pass data down the widget tree. It's not necessarily tied to the number of widgets you have.

If you have 4 different classes that extend `ChangeNotifier`, it means you have 4 different types of data that you want to manage and pass around. You can provide these at the top of your widget tree and then use `Consumer` widgets or `context.read`, `context.watch`, and `context.select` to listen to changes in these data wherever you need.

Here's an example of how you can provide multiple `ChangeNotifier`:

```dart
MultiProvider(
  providers: [
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class1()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class2()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class3()),
    ChangeNotifierProvider(create: (context) => Class4()),
  ],
  child: MaterialApp(
    home: HomeScreen(),
  ),
);
```

In your `CurvedNavigationBar`, you can use `Consumer` to rebuild the navigation bar whenever there's a change in the data:

```dart
Consumer<Class1>(
  builder: (context, class1, child) {
    return CurvedNavigationBar(
      // use class1 data
    );
  },
);
```

You can do the same for `Class2`, `Class3`, and `Class4`.

However, if the 4 classes are related and are always used together, it might be better to combine them into a single class that extends `ChangeNotifier`. This way, you only need to provide and listen to one class. This can simplify your code and potentially improve performance.

Remember, the goal of using `Provider` is to manage state and make your code more maintainable. The best approach depends on the specific needs of your app.
