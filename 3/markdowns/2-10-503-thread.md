I can not find a way to collect the values of a `HashMap` into a `Vec` in the documentation. I have `score_table: HashMap<Id, Score>` and I want to get all the `Score`s into `all_scores: Vec<Score>`.

I was tempted to use the `values` method (`all_scores = score_table.values()`), but it does not work since values is not a `Vec`.

I know that `Values` implements the `ExactSizeIterator` trait, but I do not know how to collect all values of an iterator into a vector without manually writing a for loop and pushing the values in the vector one after one.

I also tried to `use std::iter::FromIterator;` but ended with something like:

```
all_scores = Vec::from_iter(score_table.values());
```


```
expected type `std::vec::Vec<Score>`
   found type `std::vec::Vec<&Score>`
```


Thanks to [Hash map macro refuses to type-check, failing with a misleading (and seemingly buggy) error message?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52093493/hash-map-macro-refuses-to-type-check-failing-with-a-misleading-and-seemingly-b), I changed it to:

```
all_scores = Vec::from_iter(score_table.values().cloned());
```


and it does not produce errors to `cargo check`.

Is this a good way to do it?

The method `Iterator.collect` is designed for this specific task. You're right in that you need `.cloned()` if you want a vector of actual values instead of references (unless the stored type implements `Copy`, like primitives), so the code looks like this:

```
all_scores = score_table.values().cloned().collect();
```


Internally, `collect()` just uses `FromIterator`, but it also infers the type of the output. Sometimes there isn't enough information to infer the type, so you may need to explicitly specify the type you want, like so:

```
all_scores = score_table.values().cloned().collect::<Vec<Score>>();
```

If you don't need `score_table` anymore, you can transfer the ownership of `Score` values to `all_scores` by:
```
let all_scores: Vec<Score> = score_table.into_iter()
                                        .map(|(_id, score)| score)
                                        .collect();
```

This approach will be faster and consume less memory than the clone approach by @apetranzilla. It also supports any struct, not only structs that implement `Clone`.

There are three useful methods on HashMaps, which all return iterators:
- [values()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.values)`&T`- [values_mut()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.values_mut)`&mut T``score_table`- [into_values()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/collections/struct.HashMap.html#method.into_values)`T``score_table``score_table`
In your example, you call `values()` to get `&T` references, then convert them to owned values `T` via a [clone()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/clone/trait.Clone.html).
Instead, if we have an iterator of owned values, then we can convert it to a `Vec` using [Iterator::collect()](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.collect):
```
let all_scores: Vec<Score> = score_table.into_values().collect();
```

Sometimes, you may need to specify the collecting type:
```
let all_scores = score_table.into_values().collect::<Vec<Score>>();
```
