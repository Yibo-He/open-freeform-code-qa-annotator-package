My Flutter application is freezing on the splash screen and I'm getting the following error log:

Looks like the problem is here:
  [ERROR:flutter/lib/ui/ui_dart_state.cc(148)] Unhandled Exception: MissingPluginException(No implementation found for method getApplicationDocumentsDirectory on channel plugins.flutter.io/path_provider)

Already done this:

-Deleted all plugins and reinstalled with `flutter pub get`.
-Runned `flutter clean` and `flutter run`

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like the issue is with the `path_provider` plugin. The error log indicates that the method `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` is not implemented in the plugin. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file and have run `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Check if you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file where you are using it. You can import it like this:

   ```
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
   ```

3. Try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` to reinstall the dependencies.

4. If the above steps don't work, try upgrading the `path_provider` plugin to the latest version by running `flutter pub upgrade`.

5. If none of the above steps work, try deleting the `pubspec.lock` file and then running `flutter pub get` to regenerate it.

Hopefully, one of these steps will resolve the issue and your app will no longer freeze on the splash screen.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue is related to the `path_provider` plugin. The error log indicates that the method `getApplicationDocumentsDirectory` is not implemented on the channel `plugins.flutter.io/path_provider`. 

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` plugin to your `pubspec.yaml` file and ran `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Check if you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file where you are using it. You can add the following import statement at the top of your file:

   ```
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
   ```

3. Try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` to reinstall all the dependencies.

4. If the above steps don't work, try running `flutter doctor` to check if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. 

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try updating the `path_provider` plugin to the latest version by running `flutter pub upgrade`. 

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the `path_provider` plugin is not properly installed or linked in your project. Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Make sure that you have added the `path_provider` dependency in your `pubspec.yaml` file and ran `flutter pub get` to install it.

2. Check if you have imported the `path_provider` package in your Dart file where you are using it. You can add the following import statement at the top of your file:

   ```
   import 'package:path_provider/path_provider.dart';
   ```

3. Try running `flutter clean` to clear the build cache and then run `flutter pub get` to reinstall all the dependencies.

4. If the above steps don't work, try running `flutter doctor` to check if there are any issues with your Flutter installation. You can also try running the app on a different device or emulator to see if the issue persists.

5. If none of the above steps work, you can try removing the `path_provider` dependency from your `pubspec.yaml` file and then adding it again. This will force Flutter to reinstall the plugin and link it properly.

Hopefully, one of these steps will help you resolve the issue.
