I'm trying to display the minimum value within a vector in Rust and can't find a good way to do so.
Given a vector of `i32` :
```
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
```

My goal here is to get the minimum value of that vector without having to sort it.
What is the best way to get the minimum value within a `Vec<i32>` in Rust ?

You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];
let min = v.iter().min();

match min {
    Some(min) => println!("The minimum value is {}", min),
    None => println!("The vector is empty"),
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option` that contains the minimum value if the vector is not empty, or `None` if it is. The `match` statement is then used to handle both possibilities. If the vector is not empty, it prints the minimum value. If the vector is empty, it prints a message indicating that.

You can use the `iter()` method to create an iterator over the vector, and then use the `min()` method to find the minimum value. Here is how you can do it:

```rust
let mut v = vec![5, 6, 8, 4, 2, 7];

if let Some(min) = v.iter().min() {
    println!("The minimum value is {}", min);
} else {
    println!("The vector is empty");
}
```

In this code, `v.iter().min()` returns an `Option` that contains the minimum value if the vector is not empty, or `None` if the vector is empty. The `if let` syntax is used to handle this `Option`.

Please note that `min()` method returns a reference to the minimum value, not the value itself. If you need the value, you can dereference it using `*`.
