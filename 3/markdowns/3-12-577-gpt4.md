I'm new to flutter. I just created a new project in flutter and have not even altered the code.
And when I run the code I get the following error.

```
Launching lib\main.dart on SM A750F in debug mode...
Gradle task assembleDebug failed with exit code -1
Exited (sigterm)
```


I have no idea how to fix this, searched a number of ways

When I run flutter doctor I get this error,

```
Android toolchain - develop for Android devices (Android SDK version 29.0.2)
    X Android license status unknown.
      Try re-installing or updating your Android SDK Manager.
      See https://developer.android.com/studio/#downloads or visit https://flutter.dev/setup/#android-setup for detailed instructions.
```


I dont know if this has got anything to do with the error above.

build.gradle(app) 

```
def localProperties = new Properties()
def localPropertiesFile = rootProject.file('local.properties')
if (localPropertiesFile.exists()) {
    localPropertiesFile.withReader('UTF-8') { reader ->
        localProperties.load(reader)
    }
}

def flutterRoot = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.sdk')
if (flutterRoot == null) {
    throw new GradleException("Flutter SDK not found. Define location with flutter.sdk in the local.properties file.")
}

def flutterVersionCode = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionCode')
if (flutterVersionCode == null) {
    flutterVersionCode = '1'
}

def flutterVersionName = localProperties.getProperty('flutter.versionName')
if (flutterVersionName == null) {
    flutterVersionName = '1.0'
}

apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply from: "$flutterRoot/packages/flutter_tools/gradle/flutter.gradle"

android {
    compileSdkVersion 28

    lintOptions {
        disable 'InvalidPackage'
    }

    defaultConfig {
        // TODO: Specify your own unique Application ID (https://developer.android.com/studio/build/application-id.html).
        applicationId "com.dev.teamo"
        minSdkVersion 16
        targetSdkVersion 28
        versionCode flutterVersionCode.toInteger()
        versionName flutterVersionName
        testInstrumentationRunner "androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner"
    }

    buildTypes {
        release {
            // TODO: Add your own signing config for the release build.
            // Signing with the debug keys for now, so `flutter run --release` works.
            signingConfig signingConfigs.debug
        }
    }
}

flutter {
    source '../..'
}

dependencies {
    testImplementation 'junit:junit:4.12'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test:runner:1.1.1'
    androidTestImplementation 'androidx.test.espresso:espresso-core:3.1.1'
}
```


Thanks in advance

The error message from `flutter doctor` suggests that the Android SDK is not properly installed or the license agreement has not been accepted. This could be the reason why your Flutter project is not building.

Here are some steps you can follow to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android SDK**: Open Android Studio, go to `Configure -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools`. Check if there are any updates available for Android SDK Build-Tools, Android SDK Platform-Tools, and Android SDK Tools. If there are, install them.

2. **Accept Android Licenses**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Android SDK is installed (usually it's in `Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk` on Mac or `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows). Once you're in the SDK directory, navigate to the `tools/bin` directory and run the command `./sdkmanager --licenses`. Accept all the licenses.

3. **Check Flutter Doctor**: Run `flutter doctor` again in your terminal to see if the issue with the Android toolchain is resolved.

4. **Clean and Rebuild Project**: Go back to your Flutter project directory in the terminal and run `flutter clean` to clean your project. Then try to run your project again with `flutter run`.

If you're still facing issues, it might be helpful to uninstall and reinstall the Android SDK. You can do this through the Android Studio SDK Manager.

Also, make sure that your Flutter SDK and Android SDK paths are correctly set in your environment variables. You can check this by running `echo $PATH` in your terminal.

The error message from `flutter doctor` indicates that the Android SDK isn't properly installed or the license agreement hasn't been accepted. This could be the reason why your Flutter project isn't running.

Here are some steps to resolve this issue:

1. **Update Android SDK:** Open Android Studio, go to `Configure -> SDK Manager -> SDK Tools`. Make sure that the `Android SDK Command-line Tools` is installed. If not, install it. If it's already installed, you might want to try updating it.

2. **Accept Android Licenses:** Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where your Android SDK is installed. This is usually in `Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk` on Mac, and `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk` on Windows. Once you're in the SDK directory, navigate to the `tools/bin` directory and run the command `./sdkmanager --licenses`. Accept all the licenses.

3. **Set Android SDK Path:** Make sure that the Android SDK path is correctly set in your environment variables. You can do this by adding the following lines to your shell configuration file (`.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc.):

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/Users/YourUsername/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

Replace `YourUsername` with your actual username. If you're on Windows, replace the paths with the appropriate Windows paths.

4. **Update Flutter:** Run `flutter doctor -v` to check for any other issues. If everything is fine, try running `flutter clean` and then `flutter run` to see if your project runs.

If you're still facing issues, please provide more details about your development environment (OS, Flutter version, Android Studio version, etc.) so I can give a more accurate solution.
