This method submits a simple HTTP request and calls a success or error callback just fine:

```
void _getSimpleReply( String command, callback, errorCallback ) async {

    try {

      HttpClientRequest request = await _myClient.get( _serverIPAddress, _serverPort, '/' );

      HttpClientResponse response = await request.close();

      response.transform( utf8.decoder ).listen( (onData) { callback( onData ); } );

    } on SocketException catch( e ) {

      errorCallback( e.toString() );

    }
  }
```


If the server isn't running, the Android-app more or less instantly calls the errorCallback.

On iOS, the errorCallback takes a very long period of time - more than 20 seconds - until any callback gets called.

There could be several reasons why the errorCallback takes a long time to get called on iOS. One possibility is that the iOS device is using a different network connection than the Android device, and there may be network issues or delays on that particular network. Another possibility is that there could be differences in the way the iOS and Android devices handle network requests and responses.

To troubleshoot this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Check the network connection on the iOS device and ensure that it is stable and has a good signal strength.

2. Try running the same code on a different iOS device or simulator to see if the issue persists.

3. Use a network monitoring tool to analyze the network traffic and see if there are any delays or errors in the request/response cycle.

4. Check the server logs to see if there are any errors or delays on the server side.

5. Try using a different HTTP client library or framework on iOS to see if that resolves the issue.

6. Consider using a different approach to handle network requests and responses, such as using a WebSocket or a REST API.

There could be a few reasons why the errorCallback takes a long time to be called on iOS:

1. Network connectivity issues: It's possible that the iOS device is experiencing network connectivity issues, which is causing the request to take longer to fail. You can try checking the device's network settings and ensuring that it has a stable connection.

2. DNS resolution issues: The iOS device may be experiencing issues with DNS resolution, which can cause delays in establishing a connection to the server. You can try using a different DNS server or checking the DNS settings on the device.

3. Firewall or security settings: It's possible that the iOS device has firewall or security settings that are blocking the request from reaching the server. You can try checking the device's security settings and ensuring that they allow the app to make network requests.

4. Server-side issues: The delay could also be caused by issues on the server-side, such as high traffic or slow response times. You can try testing the server with other requests to see if it's experiencing any issues.

Overall, it's important to investigate the root cause of the delay and address it accordingly. You can also try optimizing the code to handle network errors more efficiently, such as setting a timeout for the request.

There could be a few reasons why the errorCallback takes a long time to get called on iOS. Here are some possible causes and solutions:

1. Network connectivity issues: Check if the iOS device has a stable internet connection. If the device is connected to a weak or unstable network, it may take longer for the request to time out and trigger the errorCallback. You can try running the same code on a different network to see if the issue persists.

2. DNS resolution issues: If the server's IP address is resolved using DNS, there may be delays in resolving the domain name to an IP address. You can try using the server's IP address directly in the code instead of the domain name to see if it improves the response time.

3. Firewall or proxy issues: If the iOS device is behind a firewall or proxy server, it may be blocking the request or causing delays in the response. You can try disabling the firewall or proxy temporarily to see if it resolves the issue.

4. iOS-specific issues: There may be some iOS-specific issues that are causing the delay. You can try searching for similar issues on iOS developer forums or contacting Apple support for assistance.

In general, it's a good practice to set a timeout for the HTTP request to avoid waiting indefinitely for a response. You can set a timeout using the `HttpClientRequest.timeout` property.
