The rule of 5 states that if a class has a user-declared destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor, then it must have the other 4.
But today it dawned on me: when do you ever need a user-defined destructor, copy constructor, copy assignment constructor, move constructor, or move assignment constructor?
In my understanding, implicit constructors / destructors work just fine for aggregate data structures. However, classes which manage a resource need user-defined constructors / destructors.
However, can't all resource managing classes be converted into an aggregate data structure using a smart pointer?
Example:
```
// RAII Class which allocates memory on the heap.
class ResourceManager {
    Resource* resource;
    ResourceManager() {resource = new Resource;}
    // In this class you need all the destructors/ copy ctor/ move ctor etc...
    // I haven't written them as they are trivial to implement
};
```

vs
```
class ResourceManager {
    std::unique_ptr<Resource> resource;
};
```

Now example 2 behaves exactly the same as example 1, but all the implicit constructors work.
Of course, you can't copy `ResourceManager`, but if you want a different behavior, you can use a different smart pointer.
The point is that you don't need user-defined constructors when smart pointers already have those so implicit constructors work.
The only reason I would see to have user-defined constructors would be when:

1. you can't use smart pointers in some low-level code (I highly doubt this is ever the case).
2. you are implementing the smart pointers themselves.


However, in normal code I don't see any reason to use user-defined constructors.
Am I missing something here?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You are correct that in many cases, smart pointers can be used to manage resources and eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors. However, there are still some cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if you need to manage multiple resources or have complex ownership semantics, smart pointers may not be sufficient. In these cases, you may need to write your own resource management class with user-defined constructors and destructors.

Additionally, there may be cases where you want to customize the behavior of the copy or move constructors/assignment operators. For example, you may want to implement a deep copy instead of a shallow copy, or you may want to transfer ownership of resources in a specific way. In these cases, you would need to write your own copy/move constructors/assignment operators.

Overall, while smart pointers can eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors in many cases, there are still situations where they are necessary for more complex resource management or customization of behavior.

You are correct that in many cases, smart pointers can be used to manage resources and eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors. However, there are still cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if you need to manage multiple resources or have complex resource management requirements, smart pointers may not be sufficient. In these cases, you may need to implement your own resource management class with user-defined constructors and destructors.

Additionally, there may be performance considerations when using smart pointers. Smart pointers can have overhead compared to raw pointers, and in some cases, you may need to optimize your code by using raw pointers and implementing your own resource management.

Overall, while smart pointers can eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors in many cases, there are still situations where they are necessary or beneficial. It's important to consider the specific requirements of your code and choose the appropriate approach.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You are correct that in many cases, smart pointers can be used to manage resources and eliminate the need for user-defined constructors and destructors. However, there are still some cases where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary.

For example, if you need to manage a resource that is not a pointer, such as a file handle or a network connection, you may need to define a custom destructor to properly release the resource.

Additionally, if you need to implement custom copy or move behavior for your class, you will need to define those constructors and assignment operators explicitly.

Finally, there may be cases where you want to enforce certain constraints on how your class is constructed or destroyed, such as ensuring that certain initialization steps are performed or that resources are released in a specific order. In these cases, user-defined constructors and destructors can be useful.

In general, while smart pointers can help simplify resource management in many cases, there are still situations where user-defined constructors and destructors are necessary or desirable.
