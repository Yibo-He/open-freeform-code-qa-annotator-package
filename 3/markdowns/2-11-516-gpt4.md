The expression `new int;` such as in `int * x = new int;` is a [new expression](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/new). The term "new operator" seems to be used interchangeably with "new expression", for example in this question : [Difference between 'new operator' and 'operator new'?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1885849/difference-between-new-operator-and-operator-new)
Is it correct to say that the keyword [new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/keyword/new) as it is used in a new expression is an operator? Why or why not?
If not, is there another justification for calling a new expression "new operator"?
I am having trouble finding an authoritative definition for what constitutes an operator.
I already understand the distinction between [operator new](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/new/operator_new) which allocates memory for an object and "new expression" which may eventually call an `operator new`.

The keyword `new` in C++ is indeed considered an operator. It is a special type of operator called a memory management operator. The `new` operator is used to allocate memory on the heap for an object of a certain type, and it returns a pointer to the first byte of the newly allocated memory.

The reason it's called an operator is because it performs an operation on its operand(s), similar to how the `+` operator performs an addition operation on its operands. In the case of the `new` operator, the operation it performs is memory allocation.

The term "new expression" is used to refer to the entire expression that includes the `new` operator and the type of the object being allocated. For example, in the expression `int * x = new int;`, `new int` is the new expression.

The term "new operator" is sometimes used interchangeably with "new expression", but this can be misleading. The `new` operator is just one part of a new expression. The new expression also includes the type of the object being allocated, and it may also include an initializer to initialize the newly allocated object.

The confusion between "new operator" and "operator new" arises because "operator new" is a function that can be overloaded to customize the behavior of the `new` operator. However, the `new` operator and "operator new" are not the same thing. The `new` operator is a built-in operator that performs a series of steps, one of which is calling "operator new" to allocate memory.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

In C++, the keyword `new` is used in the context of a new-expression, which is used to create objects with dynamic storage duration. It is not an operator in the traditional sense like `+`, `-`, `*`, etc. However, it is often referred to as an operator because it performs an operation, specifically the operation of allocating memory and constructing an object.

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression" because the `new` keyword is the most prominent part of the new-expression syntax. However, this can lead to confusion with the `operator new` function, which is a different concept.

The `operator new` function is a function that can be overloaded to customize the memory allocation behavior of new-expressions. It is called by new-expressions to allocate memory, but it does not construct objects. That is the job of the new-expression itself.

As for an authoritative definition of what constitutes an operator, the C++ standard (ISO/IEC 14882) defines an operator as one of the symbols that specifies an operation to be performed on one or more operands. The `new` keyword doesn't fit this definition exactly, but it is often referred to as an operator because it performs an operation.

In summary, while the `new` keyword is not an operator in the strictest sense, it is often referred to as such because it performs an operation. The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression", but it's important to distinguish this from the `operator new` function, which is a different concept.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The term "operator" in C++ is used to refer to a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. C++ is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators:

- Arithmetic Operators
- Relational Operators
- Logical Operators
- Bitwise Operators
- Assignment Operators
- Misc Operators

The `new` keyword in C++ is often referred to as an operator because it performs a specific operation: it allocates memory dynamically on the heap and returns a pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory. However, technically speaking, `new` is not an operator in the same sense as, for example, the addition operator `+` or the assignment operator `=`. 

The `new` keyword is part of a special kind of expression in C++ called a "new expression". A new expression begins with the `new` keyword, followed by an optional sequence of new-placement arguments enclosed in parentheses, followed by the type of object to allocate, and optionally an initializer.

The term "new operator" is often used interchangeably with "new expression", but this can be confusing because there is also a function called `operator new` which is called by new expressions to allocate raw memory. 

So, to answer your question, while it's common to hear `new` referred to as an "operator", it's more accurate to say that `new` is a keyword that is used as part of a new expression. The term "new operator" is often used colloquially to refer to a new expression, but it's important to understand the distinction between a new expression and the `operator new` function.
