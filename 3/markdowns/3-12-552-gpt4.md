[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/xRIAc.png)

I'm very new to flutter so I couldn't figure it out.
I need a custom AppBar with drawer and actions but arranged like the image.

I tried a StackView in the title widget

```
appBar: AppBar(
    title: Stack(
      children: <Widget>[
        Container(
          width: double.infinity,
          color: CustomColors.accentColor,
        ),
        Text(
          'Title',
          style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0, color: CustomColors.primaryDark),
        ),
      ],
    ),
  ),
```


But I get something like this

Can someone help me out? Thank you.

The AppBar widget in Flutter is quite flexible and can be customized to a great extent. However, to achieve the layout you want, you might need to create a custom AppBar. Here's a sample code snippet that might help you:

```dart
appBar: PreferredSize(
  preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(60.0), // here the desired height
  child: AppBar(
    backgroundColor: Colors.white,
    elevation: 0,
    leading: IconButton(
      icon: Icon(Icons.menu, color: Colors.black),
      onPressed: () {
        // handle your drawer here
      },
    ),
    title: Text(
      'Title',
      style: TextStyle(color: Colors.black),
    ),
    actions: <Widget>[
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search, color: Colors.black),
        onPressed: () {
          // handle your actions here
        },
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.notifications, color: Colors.black),
        onPressed: () {
          // handle your actions here
        },
      ),
    ],
    bottom: PreferredSize(
      child: Container(
        color: Colors.grey,
        height: 1.0,
      ),
      preferredSize: Size.fromHeight(1.0),
    ),
  ),
),
```

In this code, I have used the `PreferredSize` widget to set a custom height for the AppBar. The `leading` property is used to set the drawer icon, the `title` property is used to set the title, and the `actions` property is used to set the action icons. The `bottom` property is used to set a grey line at the bottom of the AppBar.

Please replace the `Colors.white`, `Colors.black`, and `Colors.grey` with your custom colors. Also, handle the drawer and actions in the `onPressed` methods of the respective `IconButton` widgets.

The AppBar in Flutter is quite flexible and allows you to customize its layout to a great extent. However, it's important to understand how to correctly use the widgets to achieve the desired layout.

In your case, you can use a Row widget to arrange the Drawer icon, the title, and the action buttons horizontally. Here's a sample code snippet that you can use as a starting point:

```dart
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      Builder(
        builder: (context) => IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
          onPressed: () => Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer(),
        ),
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0),
      ),
      Row(
        children: <Widget>[
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.search),
            onPressed: () {},
          ),
          IconButton(
            icon: Icon(Icons.more_vert),
            onPressed: () {},
          ),
        ],
      ),
    ],
  ),
),
```

In this code:

- The `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` property makes sure that the space between the children widgets is distributed evenly.
- The `Builder` widget is used to get the current `BuildContext` that the `IconButton` for the Drawer can use to open the Drawer when pressed.
- The `Row` widget inside the main `Row` widget is used to group the action buttons together.

Please replace the `onPressed: () {}` with your own functions.

Remember to add a `Drawer` widget to your `Scaffold` for the menu button to work.

You can achieve this by using a `Row` widget instead of a `Stack` widget. The `Row` widget allows you to place widgets side by side. Here's how you can modify your code:

```dart
appBar: AppBar(
  title: Row(
    mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween,
    children: <Widget>[
      Builder(
        builder: (context) => IconButton(
          icon: Icon(Icons.menu),
          onPressed: () => Scaffold.of(context).openDrawer(),
        ),
      ),
      Text(
        'Title',
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 22.0),
      ),
      IconButton(
        icon: Icon(Icons.search),
        onPressed: () {
          // action code
        },
      ),
    ],
  ),
  backgroundColor: CustomColors.accentColor,
),
```

In this code, we use a `Row` widget to place the menu icon, title, and search icon side by side. We use `mainAxisAlignment: MainAxisAlignment.spaceBetween` to distribute the space evenly between the widgets. The `Builder` widget is used to get the current `BuildContext` which is necessary to open the drawer.

Also, the `backgroundColor` property is moved to the `AppBar` widget to change the color of the entire AppBar.
