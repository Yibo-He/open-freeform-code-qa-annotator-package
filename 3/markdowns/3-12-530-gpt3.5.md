Do I need to convert a string? to an int if the value in the string is not null. (My routeArgs variable may be is null) I was doing according to this code before the null safety:
```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
if(routeArgs["id"] != null){
   id = int.parse(routeArgs["id"]);
 }
```

But now it displays the error stating: "The argument type 'String?' can't be assigned to the parameter type 'String'."  I tried to correct as the code below:
```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
   
    int id;
    String? idtest = routeArgs["id"]; 
    if (idtest != null){
      id = int.parse(idtest);
    }
```

This code stopped giving error, but I think this is not the correct way to solve it, I would need to do this for several variable values. Would it be correct for me to make a function just for conversion? Could anyone give me an idea of a solution?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, you can create a function to handle the conversion from `String?` to `int?`. Here's an example:

```
int? parseInt(String? value) {
  if (value == null) {
    return null;
  }
  return int.tryParse(value);
}
```

Then, you can use this function to convert the `id` value:

```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;
   
int? id = parseInt(routeArgs["id"]);
```

This way, you don't need to check for null values and convert them manually every time you need to parse an integer value.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, you are correct that the second approach is the correct way to handle null safety in this case. However, if you need to do this for several variable values, it would be a good idea to create a function that handles the conversion for you. Here's an example of how you could create a function to convert a nullable string to an int:

```
int? parseInt(String? value) {
  if (value == null) {
    return null;
  }
  return int.parse(value);
}
```

You can then use this function to convert your string values to int values:

```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;

int? id = parseInt(routeArgs["id"]);
int? otherValue = parseInt(routeArgs["otherValue"]);
```

This way, you can handle null values without having to repeat the same code for each variable.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, you can create a function to handle the conversion from `String` to `int` safely. Here's an example:

```
int? safeParseInt(String? value) {
  if (value == null) {
    return null;
  }
  return int.tryParse(value);
}
```

This function takes a nullable `String` as input and returns a nullable `int`. It first checks if the input is null and returns null if it is. Otherwise, it tries to parse the input as an integer using `int.tryParse()`. If the parsing is successful, it returns the parsed integer. If not, it returns null.

You can use this function to safely convert your `String` values to `int` like this:

```
final routeArgs = ModalRoute.of(context)!.settings.arguments as Map<String, String>;

int? id = safeParseInt(routeArgs["id"]);
```

This way, you don't have to worry about null values or parsing errors.
