docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect

I'm trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019 (Docker Desktop does not work here, my VPS does not support Hyper-V).
I run this in PowerShell (all in Administrator mode)
`docker run -it --isolation=process mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t`
Then I get error:
> docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect.: Post http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.24/containers/create: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified.
See 'docker run --help'.
I ran command `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon`, as suggested here: [Docker cannot start on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40459280/docker-cannot-start-on-windows)
However, `DockerCli.exe` does not exist in a clean Docker install:

As [suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179462/where-do-i-find-dockercli-exe) I tried copying the file `DockerCli.exe` from my local Windows 10 Docker Desktop installation and reran, but then I get:
> Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Docker.Core, Version=3.0.0.50646, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Run(IReadOnlyCollection`1 args)
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Main(String[] args)
Regardless, copying files from Docker Desktop does not feel like the right approach.
I then ran `dockerd` in PowerShell since that's the only other executable in that folder:

Since I'm a newbie, I'm not sure if I just started a container and if so, which one, I just see `start.`, but no idea where that comes from or how I can configure it.

Based on Peter Wishart's suggestion I tried `uninstall-Package -Name docker`, but then I get
```
uninstall-Package : No package found for 'docker'. At line:1 char:1

Here's the full code of what I tried:
