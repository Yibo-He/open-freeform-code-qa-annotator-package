How to set tab for zsh autocompletion?

I want to set tab for zsh autocomplition plugin. There is related part of config:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                tab-char //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```
