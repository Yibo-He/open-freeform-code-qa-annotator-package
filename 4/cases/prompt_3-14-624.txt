Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code Xcode 11.3.1

I am getting `Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code` error frequently, The below workarounds which I followed but didn't help me.

: Keychain Access -> Right-click on login -> Lock & unlock again -> Clean Xcode project ->Make build again

 Build Phases -> Targets -> Embedded pods frameworks
                 

: Deleting the derived data

: Clean project and building again.

Find the below log
