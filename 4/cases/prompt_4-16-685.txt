How to add multiple PATHs to the System Variable in Environment Variables in Windows 10?

I mistakenly deleted the entire PATH variable under System Variables. So I tried to add a variable named PATH explicitly, to the System Variable. But now whenever I try to add multiple PATHs, each PATH overwrites the previous one.

As you can see, instead of opening the list of paths, it just gives the option of one path. So I tried to append a PATH variable using command line.

`setx path "D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m`

It still overwrites the previous path. As shown, the Java path(from [Screenshot 1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4V1aj.jpg)) got overwritten by the MongoDB path.

How do I resolve this issue ? How do I add multiple paths to the PATH variable ?

P.S - I use Windows 10 (64 bit).
