GitHub Action: Pass Environment Variable to into Action using PowerShell

I am using trying to build a workflow that will run in PowerShell.  I am setting an environment for my branch name to use in a step for checkout of a different repository.
```
run: |
  $branchName = $Env:GITHUB_REF -replace "refs/heads/", ""
  echo "CURRENT_BRANCH=${branchName}" | Out-File -FilePath $Env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
```

In a later step, I'm trying to pass in the variable:
```
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${env:CURRENT_BRANCH}
```

I've tried different formats involving curly brackets, but I keep getting output from the build that shows that exact text as the path.  I'm not sure sure how to get it to evaluate.
When I do  `${{ env:CURRENT_BRANCH }}` I received the following error:
> The workflow is not valid.
.github/workflows/publish.yml (Line: 54, Col: 14):
Unexpected symbol: 'env:CURRENT_BRANCH'. Located at position 1
within expression: env:CURRENT_BRANCH
