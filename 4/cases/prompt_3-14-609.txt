Why The Navigation Title doesn't show up using SwiftUI?

I am learning `SwiftUI` using apple's official tutorial:
[https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/building-lists-and-navigation)

Everything works perfectly until I try to show navigation title on an `NavigationView` by calling `.navigationBarTitle`. 

I have tried to refresh the live view, restart Xcode, but it still doesn't show up.

here is my code:

```
import SwiftUI

struct LandmarkList : View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(landmarkData) { landmark in
                LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
            }
        }
        .navigationBarItem(title: Text("Done"))
        .navigationBarTitle(Text("Landmarks"))
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LandmarkList_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LandmarkList()
    }
}
#endif
```


The Xcode looks like this:

According to the tutorial, it should show the navigation title but it doesn't in my case.

Any idea why? Thanks!
