How to save each line of text file as array through powershell

If I have a text file, C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt that has the following information:

```
collectionA.json
collectionB.json
collectionC.json
collectionD.json
```


I am wondering how, through Powershell, I am able to store each line in the text file as elements of an array such as..

```
array arrayFromFile = new Array;
foreach(line x in collection.txt)
{
    arrayFromFile.Add(x);
}
```


..with the end goal of doing the following:

```
foreach(string x in arrayFromFile)
{
    newman run x;
}
```


My apologies for the seemingly easy question - I have never dealt with Powershell before.
