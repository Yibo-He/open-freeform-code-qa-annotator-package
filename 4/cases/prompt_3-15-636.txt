 Question for better understanding and how do i want the result is.
> Wizhi answer almost matched for my question !! But need some more
changes in his answer because which code is not working for me !! And
no need to work based on  as he answered. The split work
done based on  .
Please help someone help me to Macro Code for Split data into multiple sheet within an excel workbook based on a table format. Below is the explanation of how i have done as per my knowledge and what is my expectation is !!

Please download the [Macro_Folder](https://www.dropbox.com/t/anX1TF2qb04cjO5r) and Unzip it in you "C" Drive.
Open Macro Workbook and Press Button to run macro.
If it asked for updating formulas as shown in below picture please select "Don't Update" to continue macro.

1. I have done macro for format and Split Data into multiple Sheet,But this the not exact format result which i'm looking for.
2. The split should be done in same method but for result format should be like below formats based on macro code.
3. The split data should be in Multiple sheets of within an Excel Workbook . Not split to multiple workbooks !!


 for all
