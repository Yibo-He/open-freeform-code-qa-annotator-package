gitlab runner throws "Cleaning up file based variables 00:01 ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1" at the end

Even though all my steps pass successfully , Gitlab CI shows this -
"Cleaning up file based variables
00:01
ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1"
and fails the job at the very end . Also interestingly , this only happens for my master branch . It runs successfully on other branches. Has anyone faced this issue and found a resolution ?
```

     for dir in $(git log -m -1 --name-only -r --pretty="format:" "$CI_COMMIT_SHA"); do 
     if [[ -f "$dir" ]]; then 
     SERVICE=$(echo "$dir")
     # helm install the service
     fi
     done
    - echo "deployed"
```
