How to open 'This PC' using CMD or Powershell?

I need a way of opening the explorer at This PC , in the same way as opening in a windows explorer Gui, but I am incapable of this as using Explorer.exe in CMD opens quick access.

I tried opening it with a shortcut and that too failed. 

Does anyone know of a way to do this?

Cheers
