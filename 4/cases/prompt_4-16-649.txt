Calculate the difference between two timestamps in bash

I want to find out total system boot time by subtracting two timestamps. 
First I use this command to get the start time and end time:

```
sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}'
```


which gets me the following output:

```
2020-05-21 05:52:47 2020-05-28 19:37:36
```


(The first two fields being the start time and the last two fields being the end time)

Now I want to find the difference between the start time and end time, preferably in the format:

"0 year(s), 0 month(s), 7 day(s), HH:MM:SS"
