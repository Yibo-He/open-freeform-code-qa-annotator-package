Unable to install service fabric runtime


## Update


By looking at the processes under Task Manager, I was able to locate the installer for Service Fabric Runtime (the first of the two components that are attempted installed below, and apparently the one that fails).
I found the file and tried to run it from Powershell (after first removing the Service Fabric folder that had been created during my previous attempt). The result is shown below: Apparently it starts the installation process, then freezes and stops, and times out after 10 minutes with no further explanation.
```

### Original question:


I'm not sure if this is a valid question for SO, as it relates to the setup of a dev tool/system, rather than a programming question directly, but I hope you'll let it pass, as I think it might be useful for other programmers too:
([Service Fabric GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/issues/1307#issue-1107996432)).

### Failing to install Service Fabric SDK


This is on Windows 10 (version 10.0.19044)
I downloaded the installer from the offical site ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started) ) and ran it, as I've done previously on a different PC with no issues.

### The result this time was as follows:

Looking at the  of the two logs, I get (among other stuff) this:
```

Commandline is: 'C:\Users\*MyUserName*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Web Platform Installer\installers\ServiceFabricRuntime_8_2_CU1\B9FBB56A2D94EADC21BE8863FF10FE681EC8348E\MicrosoftServiceFabric.8.2.1363.9590.exe /AcceptEULA'.

DownloadManager Warning: 0 : Dependency failed for product 'Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK - 5.2.1363'. Skipping install
```

Looking at the  of the log files, I get this:

```

I tried to locate the additional logs mentioned (`C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\FabricSetupLog.Uninstall_637781913748003856.log`), but no such log file exists at that location. The only log files I have been able to find are the ones referred to above (located under `c:\windows\Temp`).
I also tried following the "Direct download" link in the web installer (see below), but this only confirms that the Service Fabric Runtime is required first.

Any tips that might help me track down the underlying issue here would be greatly appreciated.
 (update after comment below)
I realize there appears to be an issue with files remaining from a previous installation. One of the log files mentions the folder `C:\program files\ServiceFabric`. This folder is indeed created when I try to install, but I have removed it manually before attempting again. I've done this multiple times, and restarted my PC between this and reinstallation attempts too, just to be sure. In short, I can't find any trace of Service Fabric, yet it still tells me that it is failing to uninstall. Just to be on the safe side, I've also tried removing Visual Studio completely too, in case there was some link/dependency on it somehow, but I still get the same result.
