Corrupt VBA Project Module Not Found Error

I have a workbook that was saved yesterday afternoon, and was working perfectly. I have opened it this morning, and none of the modules in the VBE are 'found'. Visually I can see them all sitting there.

When trying to open any of these modules to edit the code, the windows are greyed out, as below.

When I try exporting the code modules, I get the 'Module Not Found' errror.

Does anyone know a) why this has happened, and b) how can I fix this?
I thought initially it was the instance of my Excel, so have restarted the PC.
Any help is appreciated!
