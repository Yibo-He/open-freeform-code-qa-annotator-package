How to install cask for homebrew on mac

I have set up git and homebrew, ran `brew reset-update`, `brew update` and `brew doctor` none of these give me errors but when I try to install glew using: `brew install glew` it gives me many errors:
```
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly30.11 MiB | 4.92 MiB/s
fatal: early EOF
fatal: index-pack failed
Error: Failure while executing; `git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask     /usr/local/Homebrew/Library/Taps/homebrew/homebrew-cask` exited with 128.
```

I figured it was because cask wasn't installed(even though from what I've read it's supposed to install with homebrew) so tried to install cask separately too but it also gives me the same error as the bottom one, I've also tried reinstalling git and homebrew, updating everything as well as restarting my mac. Any help would be appreciated.
