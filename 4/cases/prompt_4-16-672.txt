How can I read a file in cat << EOF >

I would like to print a file in cat << EOF>. e.g.
```
$cat file
ad3
c43
34e
se3
we3
```

My script is:
```
$cat run.sh
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
cat file #I would like to print the content of the file here
some commands
EOF

I can't able to print as desire with `./run.sh`
Desire output
```
$cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands

we3
some commands
