How can I minify JSON in a shell script?

I've been looking for a way to uglify some JSON while in my bash console. This help using it afterward in another command (for example, to pass json inline to `httpie`)

Giving:

```
{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}
```


I want to obtain:

```
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```
