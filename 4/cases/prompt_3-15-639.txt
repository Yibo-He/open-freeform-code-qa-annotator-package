Running Excel 4.0 macro using button

Macros on my spreadsheet that have been working for years, stopped working via buttons, though they still work from the VBA Developer window.
I use a normal shape (rectangle) as the button and assigned the macro to it (selecting from "ThisWorkbook").
To head off suggested fixes I've seen for other similar posts:
- - - - - - - - - 
I created a new program to show the problem is not the code itself:
```
Sub button_not_working()
    MsgBox "button_not_working"
End Sub
```

This program works using the green Play button in the VBA screen, but not via an assigned button on a sheet.
Code is in a normal VBA code Module (not "ThisWorkbook" area on VBA screen).
Macro is assigned by right-clicking shape, and the list of available Macros is just those in "This Workbook" on the Assign Macro popup.

When clicking the Shape to run the assigned macro I get this error message.
