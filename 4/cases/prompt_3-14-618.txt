SwiftUI @Binding Initialize

Been playing around with SwiftUI and understood the concept of `BindableObjects` etc so far (at least I hope I do). 

I bumped into a stupid problem I can't seem to find an answer for: 
How do you initialize a `@Binding` variable?

I have the following code:

```
struct LoggedInView : View {

    @Binding var dismissView: Bool

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}
```


In my preview code, I want to pass that parameter of type `Binding<Bool>`:

```
#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: **Binding<Bool>**)
    }
}
#endif
```


How would I go an initialize it? tried:

```
Binding<Bool>.init(false)
Binding<Bool>(false)
```


Or even:

```
@Binding var dismissView: Bool = false
```


But none worked... any ideas?
