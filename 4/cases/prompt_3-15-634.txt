Getting Error 3340 Query ' ' is corrupt while executing queries DoCmd.RunSQL

Since installing [the windows update for Office 2010 resolving KB 4484127] I get an error while executing queries which contain a WHERE clause.

For example executing this query:

```
DoCmd.RunSQL "update users set uname= 'bob' where usercode=1"
```


Results in this error:

> Error number = 3340 Query ' ' is corrupt


How can I successfully run my queries? Should I just uninstall this update?
