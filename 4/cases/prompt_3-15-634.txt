Getting Error 3340 Query ' ' is corrupt while executing queries DoCmd.RunSQL

Since installing [the windows update for Office 2010 resolving KB 4484127](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4484127/security-update-for-office-2010-november-12-2019) I get an error while executing queries which contain a WHERE clause.

For example executing this query:

```
DoCmd.RunSQL "update users set uname= 'bob' where usercode=1"
```


Results in this error:

> Error number = 3340 Query ' ' is corrupt

The [update in question](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/20191112/security-update-deployment-information-november-12-2019) is currently still installed:

How can I successfully run my queries? Should I just uninstall this update?
