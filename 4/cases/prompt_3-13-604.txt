Android Studio: Set Text in fragment

I've recently picked up an Android Studio project I started a year ago in Kotlin.
It features three fragments that can be navigated through by a bottom navigation bar.
Now, to break my current issue down to a simple example that even doesn't work for me:
Given there's a the editText object `exercise` in `fragment_home.xml` and I want to call and alter it in `HomeFragment.kt`.
I checked every source of advice I could find from Google & Stackoverflow and came up with the following code in `HomeFragment.kt` (partially pre-coded by AndroidStudio):
```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        val view: View = inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home,container,false)

        view.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

The last line stands for every object I tried to reach. I also tried onClickListening for buttons like so:
```
val btnNewExercise =  view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {view

            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
```

but nothing happens when I start the app/ hit the buttons - I seem to can't get through to the actual view's objects to access them. Even ran into NullPointerExceptions on my way to a solution.
I could supply the fragment and layout files if needed - just thought this way it might be easier at first.
If anybody could tell me where I'm wrong I'd be really grateful! Thanks in advance!
