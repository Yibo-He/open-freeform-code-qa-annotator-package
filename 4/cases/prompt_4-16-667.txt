Tomcat 9 running on docker - Cannot find /usr/local/tomcat/bin/setclasspath.sh

I'm running a tomcat (tomcat:9-jre11) on docker, when launching it, it logs the following, then crashes :
```
Cannot find /usr/local/tomcat/bin/setclasspath.sh
This file is needed to run this program
```

My first issue was actually getting inside the container because I can't use docker exec on a crashed container, but I managed it by setting an entry point as /bin/bash in Rancher.
Now setclasspath.sh is very much in the /usr/local/tomcat/bin/ inside the container. It previously had all read and execution rights, I've set it to 777 just to be sure, still have the same issue. Same goes with changing the owner (tomcat seems to be using root, even if I launch the catalina.sh manually on another user, having changed the file owner). I used the heavy handed approch and set the whole damn folder as 777, and still the same :
```
drwxrwxrwx 1 root root   4096 Jun 29 14:53 .
drwxr-xr-x 1 root root   4096 Jun 29 14:31 ..

-rwxrwxrwx 1 root root   1918 Jun 28 03:01 version.sh
```

I've looked at the catalina.sh script, the part which cause the issue is the following :
```
if [ -r "$CATALINA_HOME"/bin/setclasspath.sh ]; then
    . "$CATALINA_HOME"/bin/setclasspath.sh
  else
    echo "Cannot find $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setclasspath.sh"
    echo "This file is needed to run this program"
  fi
```

The  inside the condition is borked. I've read it looked if the file exists and is readable, it fill all conditions. I've added elif with  and  condition and the do return true, but the rights seems to be the issue despite them being set to 777 or not. I've add a whoami inside the script as well, and it's the root user, so not an issue of ownership.
The startup.sh script has a similar issue, with a -x condition, where it cannot find the catalina.sh ...
