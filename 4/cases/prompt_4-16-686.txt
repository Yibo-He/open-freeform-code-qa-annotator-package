field is immutable k8s

I am trying to deploy an application to GCP on kubernetes, however, the deployment fails with the error `the job spec is invalid ... the field is immutable`.

In the migration job, I have a section of bash in the following format:

```
args:
        - |
          /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
          CHILD_PID=$!
          (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
          wait 
          if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```


but when the file is executed, in the yaml on GCP I see that the command has been enclosed in quotes and then it returns the above mention error.
