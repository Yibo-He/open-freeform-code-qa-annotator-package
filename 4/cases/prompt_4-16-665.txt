How can I convert an array into a comma separated string?

I have an array and I am printing it like this:

```
echo "${data[*]}"
```




```
/QE-CI-RUN-71/workspace/QE-AU/57/testng-results_1.xml 
/QE-CI-RUN-71/workspace/QE-AU/57/testng-results_2.xml
```


I want to store the above output as a comma separated value. How can I achieve this in Bash?

The data array is dynamic, it may have any number of values.
