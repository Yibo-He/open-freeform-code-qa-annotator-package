How to grep for case insensitive string in a file?

I have a file `file1` which ends with
`Success...` OR
`success...`
I want to `grep` for the word `success` in a way which is not case sensitive way.
I have written the following command but it is case sensitive
```
cat file1 | grep "success\.\.\."
```

How can i change it so that it `returns 0` with both `Success...` OR
`success...`
