How does one output bold text in powershell?

I got a  script that do some automatic procedures, I use a "Write-Host" at the end of each one of them to tell the technical user that step is finished, but I realize is kind of hard to read and keep track so, Â¿Is there a way to output a bold text?

Thank you in advance.
