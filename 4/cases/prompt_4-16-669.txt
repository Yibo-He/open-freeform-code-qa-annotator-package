How to list file and folder names in powershell?

I want to write all files and folders' names into a `.gitignore` file like the below:
```
Folder1
Folder2
File1.bar
File2.foo
```

and so on.
The writing part can be achieved with the `Out-File` command, but I'm stuck in printing those names like the format above.
I'm aware of the command `Get-ChildItem` but it prints out a bunch of metadata like dates and icons too which are useless for the matter. btw, I'm looking for a single-line , not a script.
