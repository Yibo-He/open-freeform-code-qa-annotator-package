SwiftUI @Binding update doesn't refresh view

I feel like I'm missing something very basic, but this example SwiftUI code will not modify the view (despite the Binding updating) when the button is clicked

[Tutorials](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/swiftui-understanding-binding-8e20269a76bc?) I have read suggest this is the correct way to use a binding and the view should refresh automatically

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```
