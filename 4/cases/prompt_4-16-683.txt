Changing username, hostname, and path color in iterm2

How can I change the username, hostname, and path color in iTerm2? I'm using the built-in Solarized colorscheme.

In Ubuntu, the same built-in colorscheme is highlighted like:

In iTerm2:

Current iTerm2 settings:

and

I've been playing around the settings but can't get it to work. I've also gone through numerous links, but those also settings don't work.

I'm on macOS 10.15.4
