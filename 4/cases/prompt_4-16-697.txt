Why `~/.bashrc` is not executed when run docker container?

I have a docker file as below. `launch.sh` is the entry point in this docker image. 

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        vim \
        net-tools \
        git \
        iputils-ping \
        wget

RUN apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ make libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install 7.9.0 && npm install -g npm@5.6.0

ADD ./Docker/launch.sh /workspace/

CMD ["/bin/sh", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


The content of `launch.sh` is:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```


when I run the docker container: `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, I got this error:

```
npm: not found
node: not found
```


The `node` in this image is managed by `nvm` which has been installed and its script has been set on `/root/.bashrc` file. But I don't know why it can't find the nodejs commands. But if I run the container by `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash`, then manually run `workspace/launch.sh` command, everything works fine. It seems the `~/.bashrc` is not executed when run the image. How can I let the container source .bashrc?

The content of `/root/.bashrc` is:
