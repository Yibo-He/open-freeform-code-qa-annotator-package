This error message suggests that the preview instance cannot be found in any targets in the current scheme. Here are a few things you can try to fix the issue:

1. Check your scheme settings: Make sure that the target containing the preview code is included in the current scheme. You can do this by going to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme and selecting the Build tab. Make sure that the target containing the preview code is checked.

2. Clean and rebuild your project: Sometimes Xcode can get confused and fail to build previews. Try cleaning your project (Product > Clean Build Folder) and rebuilding it (Product > Build).

3. Try a different device: Sometimes previews fail to launch on certain devices. Try changing the preview device to a different one and see if that helps.

4. Update Xcode: Make sure you are using the latest version of Xcode. If you are not, try updating to the latest version and see if that fixes the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your project and the specific error message you are seeing.
