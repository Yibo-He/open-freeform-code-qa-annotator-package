This error message suggests that the preview code is not associated with any target in the current Xcode scheme. Here are a few things you can try to fix the issue:

1. Check the scheme settings: Make sure that the scheme for your project is set up correctly. Go to Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme and make sure that the correct target is selected for the scheme.

2. Clean the build folder: Sometimes Xcode can get confused and fail to build the preview. Try cleaning the build folder by going to Product > Clean Build Folder and then try running the preview again.

3. Restart Xcode: If all else fails, try restarting Xcode. This can sometimes fix issues with previews not working.

4. Check for updates: Make sure that you have the latest version of Xcode installed. If not, try updating to the latest version and see if that fixes the issue.

Hopefully, one of these solutions will help you get your SwiftUI previews working again.
