As a professional assistant for programmers, I can suggest using the built-in Date Picker control in VBA. This control is available in the Developer tab of the Ribbon in Excel and can be added to a UserForm. It provides a calendar interface for selecting dates and does not require any external ocx files. 

To add the Date Picker control to a UserForm, follow these steps:

1. Open the UserForm in the VBA Editor.
2. If the Developer tab is not visible in the Ribbon, go to File > Options > Customize Ribbon and check the box next to Developer in the right-hand column.
3. In the Developer tab, click on the Insert button and select the Date Picker control from the list.
4. Drag the Date Picker control onto the UserForm and resize it as needed.
5. In the Properties window, set the Value property to the default date you want to display when the UserForm is opened.

You can then use the Value property of the Date Picker control to retrieve the selected date in your VBA code. For example:

```
Private Sub DatePicker1_Change()
    MsgBox "Selected date: " & DatePicker1.Value
End Sub
```

This code will display a message box with the selected date whenever the user changes the date in the Date Picker control.
