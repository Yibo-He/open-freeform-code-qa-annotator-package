To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to define a type that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol. Here's an example of how you can modify your code to conform to `ShapeStyle`:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedStyle())
    }
}

struct RedStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Self.Configuration) -> some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

In this example, we define a new type called `RedStyle` that conforms to `ShapeStyle`. The `makeBody(configuration:)` method returns a `View` that represents the style. In this case, we return `Color.red`, which is a `View` that represents a solid color. 

Now you can use `RedStyle()` as a `ShapeStyle` to fill your `Circle`.
