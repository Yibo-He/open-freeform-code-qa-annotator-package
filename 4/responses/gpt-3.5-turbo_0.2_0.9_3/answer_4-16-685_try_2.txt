To add multiple paths to the PATH variable, you need to separate each path with a semicolon (;). Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Environment Variables window by pressing the Windows key + Pause/Break key.

2. Click on the "Environment Variables" button at the bottom of the window.

3. Under "System Variables", find the "PATH" variable and click on "Edit".

4. In the "Edit environment variable" window, click on "New" and enter the first path you want to add.

5. Click on "New" again and enter the second path, separated by a semicolon from the first path.

6. Repeat step 5 for each additional path you want to add.

7. Click "OK" to close all the windows.

Alternatively, you can use the command line to add multiple paths to the PATH variable. Here's an example:

`setx PATH "%PATH%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m`

This command will append the MongoDB path to the existing PATH variable. Note that you need to include the existing PATH variable (%PATH%) in the command, followed by a semicolon (;) and the new path you want to add.
