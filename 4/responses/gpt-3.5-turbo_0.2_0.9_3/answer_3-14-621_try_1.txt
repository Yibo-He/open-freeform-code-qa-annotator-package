The error message is telling you that you cannot access a `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of a `View`. This is because `@State` is a property wrapper that is designed to work specifically with SwiftUI's view rendering system.

To achieve what you want, you can use a different property wrapper called `@Binding`. `@Binding` allows you to create a two-way connection between a property in a parent view and a property in a child view.

Here's an updated version of your code that uses `@Binding` instead of `@State`:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @Binding var fullText: String

    init(letter: String, fullText: Binding<String>) {
        self._fullText = fullText
        self.fullText = list[letter]!
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("", text: $fullText)
    }
}
```

In this version, we've changed `fullText` to be a `@Binding` instead of a `@State`. We've also added a new parameter to the `init` method that takes a `Binding<String>` as an argument. This allows us to create a two-way connection between the `fullText` property in this view and a property in a parent view.

To use this view, you would create a parent view that passes in a `@State` property as a `Binding<String>` to the `StateFromOutside` view:

```
struct ParentView: View {
    @State var text = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            StateFromOutside(letter: "a", fullText: $text)
            Text("You typed: \(text)")
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, we're creating a `ParentView` that has a `@State` property called `text`. We're then passing this property as a `Binding<String>` to the `StateFromOutside` view. When the user types into the `TextField`, the `text` property in the `ParentView` will be updated automatically.
