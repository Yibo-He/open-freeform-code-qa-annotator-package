To reference an environment variable in a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use the `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` syntax. In your case, you can try using `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}` instead of `${env:CURRENT_BRANCH}` in your checkout step.

Here's an updated version of your workflow:

```
run: |
  $branchName = $Env:GITHUB_REF -replace "refs/heads/", ""
  echo "CURRENT_BRANCH=${branchName}" | Out-File -FilePath $Env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append

- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This should evaluate the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable and use its value as the `ref` parameter for the `actions/checkout` action.
