A NuGet provider is a PowerShell module that allows you to interact with NuGet-based repositories. It is not the same as the `nuget.exe` command-line tool, although the provider may use `nuget.exe` under the hood.

To install the NuGet provider without an internet connection, you can download the NuGet provider module from the PowerShell Gallery on a computer with internet access, transfer it to the offline computer, and then install it manually.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. On a computer with internet access, open a PowerShell console and run the following command to download the NuGet provider module:

   ```
   Save-Module -Name NuGet -Path C:\Temp
   ```

   This will download the latest version of the NuGet provider module and save it to the `C:\Temp` directory.

2. Transfer the `NuGet` directory from `C:\Temp` to the offline computer.

3. On the offline computer, open a PowerShell console and run the following command to install the NuGet provider module:

   ```
   Import-Module C:\Path\To\NuGet\NuGet\2.8.5.201\NuGet.psd1
   ```

   Replace `C:\Path\To\NuGet` with the path to the directory where you transferred the `NuGet` directory.

4. Once the NuGet provider is installed, you should be able to install the `PSWindowsUpdate` module using the following command:

   ```
   Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -RequiredVersion 2.0.0.4 -AllowClobber -Verbose -SkipPublisherCheck -Scope AllUsers -Repository C:\Path\To\PSWindowsUpdate\PSWindowsUpdate\2.0.0.4
   ```

   Replace `C:\Path\To\PSWindowsUpdate` with the path to the directory where you saved the `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` file.

Note that the `-SkipPublisherCheck` parameter is used to bypass the publisher check for the `PSWindowsUpdate` module, since it is not signed. This is necessary to install the module without an internet connection.
