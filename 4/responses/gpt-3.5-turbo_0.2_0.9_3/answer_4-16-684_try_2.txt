To reference an environment variable in a GitHub Actions workflow, you can use the `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}` syntax. In your case, you can try the following:

```
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This should evaluate the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable and use its value as the `ref` parameter for the `actions/checkout` action.
