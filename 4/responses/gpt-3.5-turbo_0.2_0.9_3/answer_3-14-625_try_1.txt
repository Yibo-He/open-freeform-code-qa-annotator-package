To check if the keyboard is present when a button is pressed, you can use the following code:

```
if (Input.anyKeyDown) {
    if (Event.current.isKey) {
        Debug.Log("Keyboard is present");
    }
}
```

This code checks if any key is pressed and then checks if the event is a key event. If it is, then it logs that the keyboard is present.

Note that this code should be placed in the `Update()` function of a script attached to a GameObject in your scene. Also, make sure that you have imported the `UnityEngine` namespace at the top of your script.
