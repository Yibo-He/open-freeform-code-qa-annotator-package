Yes, you can disable the interactive pager by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. This will prevent the AWS CLI from opening the interactive pager and instead display the output directly in the terminal.

You can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable in your bash script before running the `aws` command like this:

```
AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo;
```

This will disable the interactive pager and allow the `for` loop to continue to the next iteration without any manual intervention.

Alternatively, you can redirect the output of the `aws` command to a file using the `>` operator like this:

```
aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt;
```

This will redirect the output of the `aws` command to a file called `output.txt` instead of displaying it in the terminal. You can then review the output later if needed.
