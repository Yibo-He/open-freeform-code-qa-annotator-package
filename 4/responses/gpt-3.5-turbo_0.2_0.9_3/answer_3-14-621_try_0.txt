The error message is indicating that you are trying to access the `@State` variable outside of the `body` property of the `View`. This is not allowed in SwiftUI.

To achieve what you are trying to do, you can use a different approach. Instead of initializing the `@State` variable in the `init()` method, you can pass the dictionary value as a parameter to the `TextField` directly.

Here's an updated version of your code that should work:

```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    let letter: String

    var body: some View {
        TextField(list[letter] ?? "", text: $fullText)
    }
    
    @State private var fullText: String = ""
}
```

In this version, we are passing the dictionary value as a default value to the `TextField` using the nil-coalescing operator (`??`). We are also declaring the `@State` variable inside the `View`'s `body` property, which is the correct place to use it.

Now you can create an instance of `StateFromOutside` and pass the letter you want to use as a parameter:

```
let view = StateFromOutside(letter: "a")
```

This should initialize the `TextField` with the value "Letter A".
