The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelectedListener` is triggered only when an item is selected in the spinner. Until then, the `itemSelected` variable remains empty. When an item is selected, the `onItemSelected` method is called and the `itemSelected` variable is assigned the selected item from the list. That's why you see the log with `itemSelected` value after the log without any value.

If you want to return the selected item from the function, you can't do it synchronously because the selection happens asynchronously. One way to achieve this is by using a callback function. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this modified function, instead of returning the selected item, we pass a callback function as a parameter. The callback function takes a `String` parameter, which is the selected item from the spinner. When an item is selected, we call the callback function with the selected item as the argument.

To use this function, you can pass a lambda function as the callback parameter. Here's an example:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
    Log.e("categoryLog", "Selected item: $selectedItem")
}
```

In this example, we pass a lambda function that takes the selected item as a parameter and logs it. You can replace the log statement with any other code that you want to execute with the selected item.
