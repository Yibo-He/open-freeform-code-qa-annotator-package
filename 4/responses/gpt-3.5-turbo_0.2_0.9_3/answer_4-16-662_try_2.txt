You can use the `jq` command-line tool to achieve this. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor that can be used to manipulate and transform JSON data.

To uglify your JSON, you can use the following command:

```
jq -c . input.json
```

This will read the JSON data from the `input.json` file and output it in a compact format. The `-c` option tells `jq` to output the data in a compact form, and the `.` argument specifies that the entire input should be processed.

If you want to pass the JSON data directly to another command, you can use command substitution to capture the output of the `jq` command and use it as input to the next command. For example, to pass the uglified JSON to `httpie`, you can use the following command:

```
http POST http://example.com/api data="$(jq -c . input.json)"
```

This will send a POST request to `http://example.com/api` with the uglified JSON data as the request body. The `$()` syntax is used to capture the output of the `jq` command and insert it into the `data` parameter of the `http` command.
