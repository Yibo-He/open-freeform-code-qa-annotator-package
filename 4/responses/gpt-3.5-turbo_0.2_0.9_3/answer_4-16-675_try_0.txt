To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch --show-current
```

This command will display the name of the current branch that your HEAD is pointing to.

If you want to display the branch name in the terminal prompt, you can modify your PS1 environment variable. Here's an example:

```
export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\$ '
```

This will display the current branch name in parentheses at the end of your terminal prompt. You can add this line to your .bashrc file to make it permanent.
