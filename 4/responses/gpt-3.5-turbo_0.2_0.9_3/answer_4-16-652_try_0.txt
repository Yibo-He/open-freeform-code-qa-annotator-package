Yes, you can disable the interactive pager by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. This will cause the AWS CLI to output the results directly to the console instead of opening the interactive pager.

You can set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable in your bash script before running the `aws` command, like this:

```
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This should prevent the interactive pager from popping up and allow your `for` loop to continue to the next iteration without any manual intervention.

Alternatively, you can redirect the output of the `aws` command to a file using the `>` operator. This will save the output to a file instead of displaying it on the console. Here's an example:

```
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > /dev/null; 
done
```

In this example, the `> /dev/null` redirects the output to the null device, which discards it. This will prevent the output from being displayed on the console and allow your `for` loop to continue to the next iteration without any manual intervention.
