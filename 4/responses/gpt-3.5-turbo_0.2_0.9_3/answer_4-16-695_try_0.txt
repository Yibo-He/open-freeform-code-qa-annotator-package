On macOS, Docker Desktop uses a different logging driver than on Linux. By default, it uses the `json-file` driver, which only shows a brief overview of the build process.

To see the full log output, you can switch to the `tty` logging driver by adding the `--progress=auto --tty` flags to your `docker build` command. This will show the full log output, including the `ls -la` commands you are expecting.

Here's an example command:

```
docker build --progress=auto --tty -t myimage .
```

Alternatively, you can change the default logging driver in Docker Desktop settings. Open Docker Desktop, go to Preferences > Docker Engine, and add the following line to the JSON configuration:

```
"features": {
    "buildkit": true
},
"registry-mirrors": [],
"debug": true,
"experimental": true,
"metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323",
"experimental": true,
"debug": true,
"log-driver": "local",
"log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
}
```

Save the changes and restart Docker Desktop. This will switch the logging driver to `local`, which should show the full log output by default.
