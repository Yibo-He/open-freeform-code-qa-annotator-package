To add multiple paths to the PATH variable, you need to separate each path with a semicolon (;). Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Environment Variables window by pressing the Windows key + Pause/Break key. Alternatively, you can right-click on This PC/My Computer and select Properties. Then click on Advanced system settings and click on the Environment Variables button.

2. Under System Variables, select the PATH variable and click on Edit.

3. In the Edit Environment Variable window, add a semicolon (;) at the end of the existing value and then add the path you want to add. For example, if the existing value is "C:\Windows\System32", you can add a new path "D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" by typing ";D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" at the end of the existing value.

4. Click on OK to save the changes.

5. Repeat step 3 for each path you want to add, separating each path with a semicolon (;).

6. Click on OK to close the Environment Variables window.

Alternatively, you can use the command line to add multiple paths to the PATH variable. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Command Prompt as an administrator.

2. Type the following command to add a new path to the PATH variable:

   `setx path "%path%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m`

   This command appends the new path to the existing value of the PATH variable.

3. Repeat step 2 for each path you want to add, separating each path with a semicolon (;).

4. Close the Command Prompt.

After adding the paths to the PATH variable, you may need to restart any open command prompt windows or applications for the changes to take effect.
