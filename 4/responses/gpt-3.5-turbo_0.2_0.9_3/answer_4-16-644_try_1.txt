This error message indicates that you do not have the necessary permissions to execute the `startup.sh` script. 

You can try changing the permissions of the script using the `chmod` command. For example, you can run the following command to give execute permissions to the owner of the file:

```
chmod u+x startup.sh
```

Alternatively, you can try running the command with elevated privileges using `sudo`:

```
sudo ./startup.sh nginx:start
```

This will prompt you for your password and then execute the command with root privileges. However, be cautious when using `sudo` as it can potentially cause damage to your system if used improperly.
