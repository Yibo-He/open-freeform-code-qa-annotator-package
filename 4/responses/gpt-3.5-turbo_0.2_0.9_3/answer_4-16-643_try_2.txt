To achieve this, you can use the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable in your `.bashrc` file to set the terminal window title to the current working directory and the last executed command.

Here's an example of how you can set it up:

1. Open your `.bashrc` file in a text editor:
```
$ nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:
```
PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${PWD##*/} (${BASH_COMMAND})\007"'
```

This will set the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable to a command that echoes the current working directory and the last executed command, separated by a space, and sets the terminal window title to this string.

3. Save and close the file.

4. Reload your `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:
```
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, whenever you execute a command in the terminal, the window title will be updated to show the current working directory and the last executed command.
