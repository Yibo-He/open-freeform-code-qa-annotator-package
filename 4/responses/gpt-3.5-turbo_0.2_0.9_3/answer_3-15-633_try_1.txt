Yes, you can achieve the same result in Office Pro Plus 2019 using the `IF` and `INDEX` functions. Here's the formula you can use:

`=IFERROR(INDEX(B:B,SMALL(IF(A:A="x",ROW(A:A)),ROW(1:1))),"")`

This is an array formula, so you need to enter it with `Ctrl + Shift + Enter` instead of just pressing Enter. Then you can drag it down to get all the values.

Alternatively, you can use a macro to achieve the same result. Here's an example macro that does the same thing:

```
Sub FilterData()
    Dim lastRow As Long
    Dim i As Long
    Dim j As Long
    
    lastRow = Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    j = 1
    
    For i = 1 To lastRow
        If Cells(i, "A").Value = "x" Then
            Cells(j, "B").Value = Cells(i, "B").Value
            j = j + 1
        End If
    Next i
End Sub
```

This macro loops through all the rows in `Column A`, and if it finds a value of "x", it copies the corresponding value from `Column B` to a new sheet. You can modify it to suit your needs.
