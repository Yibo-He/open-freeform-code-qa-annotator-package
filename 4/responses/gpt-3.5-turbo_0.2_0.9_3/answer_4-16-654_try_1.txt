To add your existing SSH key to Git Bash, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` and pressing Enter.

2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh` and pressing Enter.

3. Move your SSH key file to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv /d/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/` and pressing Enter. Replace `/d/keys` with the path to your key file and `id_rsa` with the name of your key file.

4. Change the permissions of your SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa` and pressing Enter.

5. Open the `config` file in the `.ssh` directory by typing `nano ~/.ssh/config` and pressing Enter.

6. Add the following lines to the `config` file:

```
Host github.com
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

Replace `github.com` with the hostname of the remote repository you want to clone.

7. Save the `config` file by pressing Ctrl+X, then Y, then Enter.

Now you should be able to clone the remote repository using Git Bash without having to enter your SSH key passphrase every time.
