It sounds like the VBA project may have become corrupted. Here are a few steps you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make a backup copy of your workbook before proceeding.
2. Try opening the workbook on a different computer to see if the issue persists.
3. Open a new workbook and import the modules from the corrupted workbook. To do this, go to the VBE, right-click on the project, and select "Import File." Select the module you want to import and repeat for all modules.
4. If the above steps don't work, you can try exporting all the modules to a text file, then deleting the VBA project and re-importing the modules. To export the modules, go to the VBE, select the project, and go to File > Export. Save the file as a text file. Then, delete the VBA project by right-clicking on it and selecting "Remove." Finally, re-import the modules by going to File > Import File and selecting the text file you exported earlier.

Hopefully one of these steps will help you fix the issue.
