To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a variable that can be modified by the parent view. Here's an example:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isDismissed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $isDismissed)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In this example, the `ContentView` initializes a `@State` variable called `isDismissed`. It then passes a reference to this variable to the `LoggedInView` using the `$` syntax to create a `Binding` to the variable. 

In the preview code, you can use the `.constant` method to create a `Binding` to a constant value. In this case, we're passing in `false` as the constant value. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
