The issue with your code is that you are not passing the `isSelected` binding to the `Button` view. You need to use the `$` prefix to pass the binding to the `Button` view. Here's the modified code:

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

Notice the `$` prefix before `selected` in the `ContentView` preview. This passes the binding to the `ContentView` view, allowing it to update the view when the button is clicked.
