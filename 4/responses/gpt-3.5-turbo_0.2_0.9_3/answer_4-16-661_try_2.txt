You can modify your shell script to extract the required value from the output of the SQL query. Here's an example:

```
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -S $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT << EOF
set pagesize 0 feedback off verify off heading off echo off;
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF
)
echo "Total data is ${size} GB"
```

In this modified script, we have added the following SQL*Plus commands to suppress unnecessary output:

- `set pagesize 0` - to remove the page header and footer
- `feedback off` - to suppress the "X rows selected" message
- `verify off` - to disable verification of substitution variables
- `heading off` - to remove the column headings
- `echo off` - to suppress the SQL query itself

We have also removed the `group by` clause from the SQL query, as we are only interested in the total size. Finally, we have used the `-S` option with `sqlplus` to suppress SQL*Plus commands and output.

The output of the SQL query will now be stored in the `size` variable as a single value (e.g. "12.2345"), which you can use as required.
