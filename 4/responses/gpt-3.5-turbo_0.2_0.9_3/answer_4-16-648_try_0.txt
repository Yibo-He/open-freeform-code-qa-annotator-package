The error message you are receiving indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing ones. 

To create a new directory in the main directory, you need to make sure that the file system is mounted as read-write. You can try remounting the file system with the following command:

```
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
```

This will remount the root file system as read-write, allowing you to create new directories. Once you have created the directory, you can remount the file system as read-only with the following command:

```
sudo mount -o remount,ro /
```

This will remount the root file system as read-only, ensuring that the system remains stable and secure.
