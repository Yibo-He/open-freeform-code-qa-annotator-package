The issue with your code is that you are using a `@Binding` property in your `ContentView` struct, but you are not passing a binding to it when you create an instance of the view in your `ContentView_Previews` struct. 

To fix this, you need to create a binding to the `selected` state variable in your `ContentView_Previews` struct and pass it to the `ContentView` view like this:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

By using the `$` symbol before the `selected` state variable, you create a binding to it that can be passed to the `ContentView` view. 

With this change, your code should work as expected and the view should update when the button is clicked.
