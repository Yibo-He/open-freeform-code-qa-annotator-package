You can use the Power Automate API to trigger the flow using a PowerShell script. Here are the steps to do so:

1. First, you need to get the HTTP POST URL for your flow. To do this, open your flow in Power Automate and click on the "..." menu in the top right corner. Then, select "Settings" and scroll down to the "HTTP POST URL" section. Copy the URL.

2. Open PowerShell and use the following command to trigger the flow:

```
Invoke-RestMethod -Method Post -Uri <HTTP POST URL>
```

Replace `<HTTP POST URL>` with the URL you copied in step 1.

3. Save the PowerShell script with a .ps1 extension.

4. To run the script using a keyboard shortcut, you can create a shortcut to the script on your desktop. Then, right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties". In the "Shortcut" tab, click on the "Shortcut key" field and press the desired keyboard shortcut.

5. Alternatively, you can create a batch file that runs the PowerShell script and call the batch file from a keyboard shortcut. To do this, create a new text file and paste the following command:

```
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "<path to PowerShell script>"
```

Replace `<path to PowerShell script>` with the path to your PowerShell script. Save the file with a .bat extension.

6. Create a shortcut to the batch file on your desktop and set a keyboard shortcut for it as described in step 4.

Now, when you press the keyboard shortcut, the PowerShell script will run and trigger your Power Automate flow.
