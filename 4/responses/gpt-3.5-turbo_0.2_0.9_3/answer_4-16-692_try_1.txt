Yes, Windows Terminal is a great tool for managing multiple terminal sessions in one place. To add SSH connections to Windows Terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow icon in the tab bar to open the drop-down menu.
2. Click on "Settings" to open the settings file in your default text editor.
3. Scroll down to the "profiles" section and add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```
{
    "guid": "{YOUR_GUID_HERE}",
    "name": "SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@hostname",
    "icon": "C:\\path\\to\\icon.png"
}
```

Replace `{YOUR_GUID_HERE}` with a unique identifier for this profile. You can generate a new GUID using an online tool. Replace `user@hostname` with your SSH username and hostname. Replace `C:\\path\\to\\icon.png` with the path to an icon file for this profile (optional).

4. Save the settings file and close the text editor.
5. Click on the down arrow icon again and select "SSH Connection" (or whatever you named your profile) to open the SSH session in a new tab.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside other terminal sessions.
