It seems like you are trying to access the `exercise` EditText before it has been inflated in the view hierarchy. You should be accessing the `exercise` EditText after the view has been inflated in the `onViewCreated` method of the fragment. Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in `HomeFragment.kt`:

```
class HomeFragment : Fragment() {

    private lateinit var binding: FragmentHomeBinding

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        val btnNewExercise = view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
        btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```

In this example, we are accessing the `exercise` EditText in the `onViewCreated` method after the view has been inflated. We are also setting the click listener for the `btnNewExercise` button in the same method. Make sure to replace `FragmentHomeBinding` with the name of your generated binding class.
