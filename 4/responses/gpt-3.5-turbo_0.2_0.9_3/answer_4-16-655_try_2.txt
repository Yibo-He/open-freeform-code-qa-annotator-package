The variable expansion in the `GIT_BRANCH` definition looks correct, so the issue might be with the `echo` command. 

Try enclosing the variable in double quotes to ensure that any special characters are properly interpreted:
```
job1:
  script:
    - echo "$GIT_BRANCH"
```

If that doesn't work, you can try using `set -x` to enable debugging and see what's happening with the variable expansion:
```
job1:
  script:
    - set -x
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This will print the expanded value of `$GIT_BRANCH` to the console, along with any other commands that are executed. You can use this output to help diagnose the issue.
