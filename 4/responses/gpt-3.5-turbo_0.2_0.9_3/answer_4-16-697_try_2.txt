You can try adding the following line to your `launch.sh` script before running `npm` and `node` commands:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will source the `.bashrc` file and load all the environment variables and aliases defined in it. 

So, your updated `launch.sh` script will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
``` 

This should solve the issue of not finding `npm` and `node` commands in your Docker container.
