This error can be caused by a number of different issues, so it's important to try a few different solutions to see if any of them work for you.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Clean your project: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all of the build files for your project and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Update your pods: Make sure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed (you can check by running `pod --version` in your terminal). Then, run `pod update` to update all of your pods to their latest versions.

3. Check for any pod conflicts: Sometimes, two or more pods can have conflicting dependencies. You can use a tool like `pod outdated` to check for any outdated or conflicting pods in your project.

4. Check your build settings: Make sure your build settings are configured correctly. Check the "Build Settings" tab in Xcode and make sure everything is set up correctly for your project.

5. Check for any missing files: Make sure all of the files in your project are present and accounted for. Sometimes, a missing file can cause this error.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to dig deeper into the specific error messages you're seeing to try to pinpoint the issue. You can also try reaching out to the developers of the pods you're using to see if they have any suggestions.
