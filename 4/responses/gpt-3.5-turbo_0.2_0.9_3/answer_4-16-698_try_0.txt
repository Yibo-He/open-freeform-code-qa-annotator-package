In MacOS, you can restart your current terminal session by using the following command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you have made to it. You can also use this command to reload any other configuration files that you have modified.

Alternatively, you can use the `exec bash` command in MacOS terminal as well, but you need to use it slightly differently. Instead of typing `exec bash` directly into the terminal, you need to type:

```
exec $SHELL
```

This will restart your current terminal session and reload your updated `.bash_profile` file.
