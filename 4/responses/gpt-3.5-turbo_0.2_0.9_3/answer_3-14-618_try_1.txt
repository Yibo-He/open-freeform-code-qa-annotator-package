To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a `Bool` variable that will be used as the source of truth for the binding. Here's an example:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isDismissed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $isDismissed)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In the above example, we initialize the `isDismissed` variable as a `@State` variable in the `ContentView`. We then pass in a reference to this variable using the `$` symbol to create a binding to it in the `LoggedInView`. 

In the preview code, we use the `.constant` method to create a constant binding to `false`. This is because we cannot use a `@State` variable in the preview code.
