You can use the `declare` command in bash to get a list of environment variables with their values. Here's an example:

```
$ export MYVAR=$(echo -e "something\nMYVAR=10")
$ declare -p | grep -E '^declare -x [^=]+='
declare -x MYVAR="something\nMYVAR=10"
```

The `declare -p` command prints all defined variables in a format that can be used to recreate them, and the `grep` command filters out only the lines that define environment variables. This way, you can get a list of environment variables with their values, even if they contain newlines or other special characters.
