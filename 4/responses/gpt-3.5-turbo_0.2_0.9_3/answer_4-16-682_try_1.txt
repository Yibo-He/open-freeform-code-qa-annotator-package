It seems like there might be an issue with your internet connection or with the GitHub server. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your internet connection: Make sure you have a stable internet connection and try running the command again.

2. Clear your Homebrew cache: Run `brew cleanup` to clear your Homebrew cache and then try installing glew again.

3. Manually install glew: Instead of using Homebrew, you can try manually installing glew by downloading the source code from the glew website and following the installation instructions.

4. Use a VPN: If you are still having issues, try using a VPN to connect to the internet and then try running the command again.

If none of these solutions work, you can try reaching out to the Homebrew community for further assistance.
