To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2
```

This command will display the current branch name in the terminal. To make it easier to use, you can create an alias in your `.bashrc` file:

```
alias current_branch="git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2"
```

After adding this alias, you can simply type `current_branch` in the terminal to display the current branch name.

Note: This assumes that you are currently in a Git repository. If you are not in a Git repository, the command will not display anything.
