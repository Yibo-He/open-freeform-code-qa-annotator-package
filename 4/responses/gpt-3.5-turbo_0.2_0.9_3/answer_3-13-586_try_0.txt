The error message indicates that you need to specify either `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` or `FLAG_MUTABLE` when creating a `PendingIntent` in Android SDK 31 and above. 

To fix the error, you can update the `getBroadcast()` method call in the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor to include the `FLAG_IMMUTABLE` flag as follows:

```
mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context, 0, mediaButtonIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE);
```

This should resolve the issue and allow you to update your application to Android SDK 31.
