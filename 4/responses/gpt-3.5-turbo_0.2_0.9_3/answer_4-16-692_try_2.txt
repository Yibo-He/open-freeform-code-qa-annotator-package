Yes, Windows Terminal is a great tool for managing multiple terminal sessions in one place. To add SSH connections to Windows Terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow icon in the tab bar to open the drop-down menu.

2. Click on "Settings" to open the settings file in your default text editor.

3. Scroll down to the "profiles" section and add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```
{
    "guid": "{YOUR_GUID_HERE}",
    "name": "SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@host",
    "icon": "C:\\path\\to\\icon.png",
    "hidden": false
}
```

Replace `{YOUR_GUID_HERE}` with a unique identifier for this profile. You can generate a new GUID using an online tool or by running the `New-Guid` command in PowerShell.

Replace `user@host` with your SSH username and hostname.

Replace `C:\\path\\to\\icon.png` with the path to an icon file for this profile. This is optional, but it can help you quickly identify your SSH connection in the tab bar.

4. Save the settings file and close it.

5. Open a new tab in Windows Terminal and select your SSH profile from the drop-down menu.

6. Enter your SSH password when prompted and you should be connected to your remote host.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside your other terminal sessions.
