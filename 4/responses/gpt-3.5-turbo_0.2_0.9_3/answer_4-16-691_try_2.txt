It seems like Flutter is not installed or not added to the system path. Here are the steps to install Flutter and add it to the system path:

1. Download the Flutter SDK from the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Extract the downloaded file to a desired location.
3. Add the Flutter SDK path to the system path. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:
```
export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
```
Replace [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK_DIRECTORY] with the actual path to the Flutter SDK directory.
4. Verify the installation by running the following command:
```
flutter doctor
```
This command will check if all the necessary dependencies are installed and provide guidance on how to install any missing components.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run Flutter commands in the terminal of Android Studio.
