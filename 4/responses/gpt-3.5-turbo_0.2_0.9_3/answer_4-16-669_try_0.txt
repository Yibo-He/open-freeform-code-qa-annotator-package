You can use the `Get-ChildItem` command with the `-Name` parameter to only retrieve the names of the files and folders. Then you can use the `Out-File` command to write the names to a `.gitignore` file. Here's an example:

```
Get-ChildItem -Name | Out-File .gitignore
```

This will write the names of all files and folders in the current directory to a `.gitignore` file. If you want to exclude certain files or folders, you can use the `-Exclude` parameter with `Get-ChildItem`. For example:

```
Get-ChildItem -Name -Exclude *.log,Folder1 | Out-File .gitignore
```

This will exclude all files with the `.log` extension and the `Folder1` folder from the list of names written to the `.gitignore` file.
