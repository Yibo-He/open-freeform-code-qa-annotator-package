The variable expansion in the `GIT_BRANCH` definition looks correct. However, the issue might be with the `bash` runner interpreting the `${}` syntax differently than expected.

Try changing the variable expansion syntax to use `$()` instead of `${}`:
```
variables:
  GIT_BRANCH: "$(echo ${CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME:-${CI_COMMIT_BRANCH:-$CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH}})"

job1:
  script:
    - echo $GIT_BRANCH
```

This should ensure that the variable expansion is evaluated correctly by the `bash` runner.
