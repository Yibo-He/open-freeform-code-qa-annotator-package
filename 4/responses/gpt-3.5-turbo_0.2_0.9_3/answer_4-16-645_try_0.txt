A NuGet provider is a PowerShell module that allows you to interact with NuGet-based repositories. It is not the same as the NuGet command-line tool (nuget.exe), although the provider does use the tool to perform some of its functions.

To install the NuGet provider without an internet connection, you can download the NuGet provider module from the PowerShell Gallery on a computer that is connected to the internet, and then copy it to the target computer.

Here are the steps to do this:

1. On a computer that is connected to the internet, open a PowerShell console and run the following command to download the NuGet provider module:

   ```powershell
   Save-Module -Name NuGet -Path C:\temp
   ```

   This will download the latest version of the NuGet provider module and save it to the C:\temp directory.

2. Copy the downloaded module to the target computer using a USB drive or other method.

3. On the target computer, open a PowerShell console and run the following command to import the NuGet provider module:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module C:\path\to\NuGet\2.8.5.201\NuGet.psd1
   ```

   Replace "C:\path\to\NuGet\2.8.5.201" with the path to the directory where you copied the NuGet provider module.

4. Once the NuGet provider is installed, you should be able to install the PSWindowsUpdate module using the following command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module -Name PSWindowsUpdate -RequiredVersion 2.0.0.4 -AllowClobber -Verbose -SkipPublisherCheck -Force
   ```

   Replace "-RequiredVersion 2.0.0.4" with the version of the PSWindowsUpdate module that you want to install, and adjust the other parameters as needed.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
