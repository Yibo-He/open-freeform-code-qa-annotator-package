It seems like the issue is not with the file permissions, but with the environment variable `CATALINA_HOME`. The error message indicates that the script cannot find the `setclasspath.sh` file in the `$CATALINA_HOME/bin` directory.

You can try setting the `CATALINA_HOME` environment variable explicitly in your Dockerfile or in the container's environment variables. For example, add the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
ENV CATALINA_HOME /usr/local/tomcat
```

Alternatively, you can modify the `catalina.sh` script to explicitly set the `CATALINA_HOME` variable before the `if` statement that checks for the `setclasspath.sh` file. For example:

```
CATALINA_HOME=/usr/local/tomcat

if [ -r "$CATALINA_HOME"/bin/setclasspath.sh ]; then
  . "$CATALINA_HOME"/bin/setclasspath.sh
else
  echo "Cannot find $CATALINA_HOME/bin/setclasspath.sh"
  echo "This file is needed to run this program"
fi
```

Make sure to rebuild your Docker image after making any changes to the Dockerfile.
