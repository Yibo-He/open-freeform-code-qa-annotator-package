Great idea! Windows Terminal is a powerful tool that can be used to manage multiple terminal sessions in one place. Here's how you can set up SSH connections in Windows Terminal:

1. Install OpenSSH client on your Windows machine. You can do this by going to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Optional features > Add a feature > OpenSSH Client.

2. Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow next to the "+" icon in the tab bar. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. In the settings file, scroll down to the "profiles" section and add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```
{
    "guid": "{your-ssh-guid-here}",
    "name": "SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@hostname",
    "icon": "C:/path/to/icon.png"
}
```

Replace `{your-ssh-guid-here}` with a unique identifier for your SSH connection, `user` with your username, `hostname` with the hostname or IP address of the remote machine, and `C:/path/to/icon.png` with the path to an icon file for your connection.

4. Save the settings file and restart Windows Terminal.

5. You should now see your SSH connection profile in the dropdown menu in the tab bar. Click on it to open a new tab with your SSH session.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside other terminal sessions.
