The error message indicates that the `TextInputLayout` requires the app theme to be `Theme.MaterialComponents` or a descendant of it. However, in your `styles.xml`, the parent of your app theme is `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar`. 

To fix the error, you can change the parent of your app theme to `Theme.MaterialComponents` or one of its descendants, such as `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light` or `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar`. 

For example, you can change your app theme to:

```
<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents">
```

Or:

```
<style name="AppTheme" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light">
```

After making the change, make sure to clean and rebuild your project to ensure that the changes are applied correctly.
