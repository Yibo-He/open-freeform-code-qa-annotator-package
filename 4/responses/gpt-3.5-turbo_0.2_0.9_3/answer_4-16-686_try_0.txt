It looks like the issue is with the way you are defining the `args` field in your Kubernetes deployment YAML file. The error message suggests that you are trying to modify an immutable field, which could be caused by the quotes around the command.

To fix this issue, you can try defining the `args` field as an array of strings instead of using a multi-line string with a pipe symbol. Here's an example:

```
args:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
    CHILD_PID=$!
    (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
    wait 
    if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```

This should define the `args` field as an array of strings, with each line of the command as a separate string element. This should prevent the quotes from being added around the command and allow the deployment to succeed.
