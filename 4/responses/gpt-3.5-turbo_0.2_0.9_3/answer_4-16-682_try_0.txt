It seems like there might be an issue with your internet connection or with the GitHub server. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your internet connection: Make sure that you are connected to the internet and that your connection is stable. You can try running a speed test to see if your internet connection is slow or unstable.

2. Clear your Homebrew cache: Run the following command to clear your Homebrew cache:

   ```
   brew cleanup
   ```

3. Reset your Homebrew installation: Run the following command to reset your Homebrew installation:

   ```
   ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/uninstall)"
   ```

   Then, reinstall Homebrew by running:

   ```
   /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
   ```

4. Try installing GLEW using a different method: Instead of using Homebrew, you can try downloading and installing GLEW manually from the official website.

5. Contact GitHub support: If none of the above solutions work, you can try contacting GitHub support to see if there is an issue with their servers.
