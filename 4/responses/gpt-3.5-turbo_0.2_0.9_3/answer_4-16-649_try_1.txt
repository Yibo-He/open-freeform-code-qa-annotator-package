You can use the following command to calculate the difference between the start time and end time:

```
start_time="2020-05-21 05:52:47"
end_time="2020-05-28 19:37:36"
duration=$(($(date -d "$end_time" +%s) - $(date -d "$start_time" +%s)))
printf '%d year(s), %d month(s), %d day(s), %02d:%02d:%02d\n' $(($duration/31536000)) $(($duration%31536000/2592000)) $(($duration%2592000/86400)) $(($duration/3600%24)) $(($duration/60%60)) $(($duration%60))
```

Replace the `start_time` and `end_time` variables with the output you got from the previous command.

This will give you the duration in the format you specified.
