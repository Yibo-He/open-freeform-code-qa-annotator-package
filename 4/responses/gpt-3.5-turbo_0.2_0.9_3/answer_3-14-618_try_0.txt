To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a `Bool` variable that is marked with `@State` in the parent view. Here's an example:

```
struct ParentView: View {
    @State var dismissView = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $dismissView)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In this example, the `ParentView` has a `@State` variable called `dismissView` that is passed as a reference to the `LoggedInView` using the `$` symbol to create a `Binding`. In the preview, you can use the `.constant` method to create a `Binding` to a constant value.
