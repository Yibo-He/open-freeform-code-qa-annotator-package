You can use the `$(cat file)` syntax to insert the contents of the file into the script. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will insert the contents of `file` into the script at the location where `$(cat file)` appears. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create `test.sh` with the desired output.
