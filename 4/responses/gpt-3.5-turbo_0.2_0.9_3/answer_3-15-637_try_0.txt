It's possible that the issue is related to the version of the Selenium WebDriver that you're using. Excel 2019 may require a different version than Excel 2013. 

You can try updating the Selenium WebDriver to the latest version and see if that resolves the issue. You can download the latest version from the Selenium website: https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/

If that doesn't work, you can try using a different browser driver. For example, instead of using the Internet Explorer driver, you can try using the Chrome driver or the Firefox driver. You'll need to download the appropriate driver and update your code to use it. 

Finally, you can try checking the references in your VBA project to make sure they're all pointing to the correct versions. In the VBA editor, go to Tools > References and make sure all the references are checked and there are no missing references.
