To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional line of code to remove the spaces. Here is the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, the `Replace` function is used to remove all spaces from the string after the special characters have been replaced with spaces. The `Replace` function takes two arguments - the first argument is the string to be searched for spaces, and the second argument is the string to replace the spaces with (in this case, an empty string). The modified code will now output the string without any spaces.
