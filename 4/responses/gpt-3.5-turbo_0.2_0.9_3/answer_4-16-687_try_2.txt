To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one.
3. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's an example code snippet in PHP:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode('-', $var1);
$camelCase = $words[0];
for ($i = 1; $i < count($words); $i++) {
  $camelCase .= ucfirst($words[$i]);
}
echo $camelCase; // Output: "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the underscore (`_`) as the delimiter.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.
3. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's an example code snippet in PHP:

```
$var2 = "my_Name_is";
$words = explode('_', $var2);
$pascalCase = "";
foreach ($words as $word) {
  $pascalCase .= ucfirst($word);
}
echo $pascalCase; // Output: "MyNameIs"
```
