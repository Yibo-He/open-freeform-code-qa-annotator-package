The issue might be related to the file permissions. Starting from Android 10 (API level 29), the access to external storage is restricted by default. You need to request the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission in your app's manifest file and also request the permission at runtime.

To request the permission at runtime, you can use the following code:

```
if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(
        context,
        Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE
    ) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED
) {
    ActivityCompat.requestPermissions(
        activity,
        arrayOf(Manifest.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE),
        REQUEST_CODE_WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_PERMISSION
    )
}
```

Replace `context` with your app's context and `activity` with your current activity. Also, define the `REQUEST_CODE_WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_PERMISSION` constant with a unique integer value.

After requesting the permission, you can check if it is granted or not in the `onRequestPermissionsResult` method:

```
override fun onRequestPermissionsResult(
    requestCode: Int,
    permissions: Array<String>,
    grantResults: IntArray
) {
    if (requestCode == REQUEST_CODE_WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE_PERMISSION) {
        if (grantResults.isNotEmpty() && grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
            // Permission granted, you can now create the file
        } else {
            // Permission denied, show a message to the user
        }
    }
}
```

Make sure to handle the permission request result accordingly.

Also, starting from Android 11 (API level 30), you need to use the `MediaStore` API to save files to external storage. You can check if your app is running on Android 11 or higher and use the `MediaStore` API instead of creating a file directly on the file system.
