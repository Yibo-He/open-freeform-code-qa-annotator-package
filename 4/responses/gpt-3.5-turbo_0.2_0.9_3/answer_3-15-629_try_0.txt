You can try using the `Clipboard.SetText` method to copy the text value to the Windows clipboard. Here's an example code snippet that you can modify to suit your needs:

```
Dim objData As New DataObject
objData.SetText Me.NodeKey.Value
objData.PutInClipboard
```

This code creates a new `DataObject` and sets its text value to the `NodeKey.Value`. Then it puts the data object in the clipboard using the `PutInClipboard` method. 

If you're still having trouble copying the node path value to the clipboard, you can try using the `SendKeys` method to simulate the Ctrl+C keystroke combination. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdSelectRecord
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy
```

This code sets the focus on the `NodeKey` control, selects the record, and then copies it to the clipboard using the `acCmdCopy` command. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
