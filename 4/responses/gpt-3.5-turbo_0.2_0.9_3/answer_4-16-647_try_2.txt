To run a Power Automate flow using a keyboard shortcut or a PowerShell script, you can use the following steps:

1. Create a new flow in Power Automate and save it.
2. Click on the "..." menu on the top right corner of the flow and select "Export".
3. Choose the "Power Automate CLI" option and download the .zip file.
4. Extract the .zip file to a folder on your computer.
5. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the folder where you extracted the .zip file.
6. Run the following command to install the Power Automate CLI:

```
npm install -g @microsoft/powerautomate-cli
```

7. Once the installation is complete, run the following command to log in to your Power Automate account:

```
paw login
```

8. Follow the prompts to log in to your account.
9. Run the following command to get a list of your flows:

```
paw list
```

10. Note the ID of the flow you want to run.
11. Create a new PowerShell script and add the following code:

```
$flowId = "your_flow_id_here"
paw run $flowId
```

12. Replace "your_flow_id_here" with the ID of the flow you noted in step 10.
13. Save the PowerShell script.
14. Create a shortcut to the PowerShell script on your desktop.
15. Right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties".
16. In the "Shortcut" tab, click on the "Shortcut key" field and press the keyboard shortcut you want to use to run the flow.
17. Click "Apply" and "OK" to save the changes.
18. Double-click on the shortcut or press the keyboard shortcut to run the flow.

This should allow you to run the Power Automate flow using a keyboard shortcut or a PowerShell script without having to manually start it in the Power Automate interface.
