Yes, it is possible to create similar scope functions in JavaScript/TypeScript. There are several libraries available that provide similar functionality. Some of the popular ones are:

1. Lodash: Lodash provides a `_.tap` function that allows you to chain a function and pass the result to the next function in the chain.

2. Ramda: Ramda provides a `tap` function that allows you to pass a value to a function and return the original value.

3. Underscore.js: Underscore.js provides a `tap` function that allows you to pass a value to a function and return the original value.

4. RxJS: RxJS provides a `tap` operator that allows you to perform side effects on the source observable without modifying it.

These libraries provide similar functionality to Kotlin's scope functions and can be used to write more concise and readable code.
