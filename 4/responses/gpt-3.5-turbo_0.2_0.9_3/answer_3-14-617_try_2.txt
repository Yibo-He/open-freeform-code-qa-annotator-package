The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command. This command is typically used to run scripts during the build process. 

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the build log for any additional error messages or warnings that may provide more information about the issue.

2. Try cleaning the project by selecting Product > Clean Build Folder from the Xcode menu. This will delete the build folder and any intermediate files that may be causing the issue.

3. Check if any of the libraries you are using have been updated recently. If so, try updating your project to use the latest version of the library.

4. Try removing the libraries one by one and see if the issue persists. This will help you identify if one of the libraries is causing the issue.

5. Try disabling any custom build scripts or phases that you may have added to the project.

6. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new Xcode project and adding your code and libraries to it. This will help you identify if the issue is specific to your project or if it is a more general issue with Xcode or the libraries you are using.
