It looks like you are trying to load data from a Power Query into a new sheet using VBA. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim queryName As String
    
    ' Set variables
    Set wb = ThisWorkbook
    Set ws = wb.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change to the sheet with your data
    queryName = "Query - Sheet1" ' Change to the name of your Power Query
    
    ' Refresh the Power Query
    For Each conn In wb.Connections
        If conn.Name = queryName Then
            conn.Refresh
            Exit For
        End If
    Next conn
    
    ' Load the data into a new sheet
    Set qt = ws.ListObjects(queryName).QueryTable
    qt.Refresh
    Set ws = wb.Sheets.Add(After:=wb.Sheets(wb.Sheets.Count))
    ws.Name = "New Sheet"
    qt.ResultRange.Copy ws.Range("A1")
    
End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have already created a Power Query and named it "Query - Sheet1". It refreshes the query, loads the data into a new sheet named "New Sheet", and copies the result range to the new sheet. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs, such as changing the name of the new sheet or the name of the Power Query.
