This error is caused by the Jacoco plugin trying to use a version of Groovy that is not compatible with the Java version being used. 

To fix this issue, you can try updating the Jacoco plugin to a version that is compatible with the Java version being used. You can also try updating the Groovy version being used by the Jacoco plugin.

You can update the Jacoco plugin by changing the `toolVersion` property in your `build.gradle` file to a version that is compatible with the Java version being used. For example, if you are using Java 8, you can try using Jacoco version 0.8.7 or higher.

```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

If updating the Jacoco plugin does not work, you can try updating the Groovy version being used by the Jacoco plugin. You can do this by adding the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```
configurations.all {
    resolutionStrategy {
        force 'org.codehaus.groovy:groovy-all:3.0.9'
    }
}
```

This will force the Jacoco plugin to use Groovy version 3.0.9, which is compatible with Java 8 and higher.

After making these changes, try running the test coverage report task again to see if the issue has been resolved.
