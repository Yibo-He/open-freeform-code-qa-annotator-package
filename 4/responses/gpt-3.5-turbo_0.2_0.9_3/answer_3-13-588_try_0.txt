The error message you are seeing is related to a problem with the Kotlin compiler. It seems that the compiler is unable to access a module descriptor, which is causing the error.

One possible solution is to try cleaning and rebuilding your project. Sometimes, this can help resolve issues related to the build process.

If that doesn't work, you can try updating your Kotlin version to the latest stable release. You can do this by changing the `kotlin_version` variable in your top-level `build.gradle` file to the latest version, which is currently `1.5.31`.

If neither of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your project setup and the specific error message you are seeing in order to diagnose the problem more accurately.
