The error message you are seeing is related to a problem with the Kotlin compiler and the module descriptor. This can happen when there is a mismatch between the version of Kotlin used in your project and the version used by the Kotlin plugin.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. Make sure that you are using the latest version of the Kotlin plugin in your project. You can check the version in your `build.gradle` file under `ext.kotlin_version`.

2. Clean and rebuild your project to ensure that all dependencies are up-to-date.

3. If the problem persists, try deleting the `.idea` and `.gradle` directories in your project and then re-importing the project into Android Studio.

4. If none of the above steps work, you can try upgrading your version of Android Studio to the latest stable release.

If you are still having issues after trying these steps, you may want to post a question on the Kotlin forums or reach out to the Kotlin team for further assistance.
