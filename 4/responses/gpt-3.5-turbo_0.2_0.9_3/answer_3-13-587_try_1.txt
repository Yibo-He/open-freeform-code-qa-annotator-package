This error occurs because the version of Jacoco you are using is not compatible with the version of Java you are using. Jacoco 0.8.6 requires Java 9 or higher, but it seems that your project is using an older version of Java.

To fix this issue, you can either upgrade your Java version to Java 9 or higher, or downgrade your Jacoco version to a version that is compatible with your current Java version.

You can also try adding the following lines to your build.gradle file to force the use of a specific Java version:

```
compileTestJava {
    options.compilerArgs << "-source" << "1.8"
    options.compilerArgs << "-target" << "1.8"
}
```

This will force the use of Java 8 for your test code, which should be compatible with Jacoco 0.8.6.
