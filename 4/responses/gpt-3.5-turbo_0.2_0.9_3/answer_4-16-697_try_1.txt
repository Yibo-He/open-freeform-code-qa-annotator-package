You can try sourcing the `.bashrc` file in your `launch.sh` script before executing the `node` command. You can add the following line at the beginning of your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` script is loaded and the `node` command is available in the environment. Your updated `launch.sh` script will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc
cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Save the changes to the `launch.sh` file and rebuild the Docker image. Then, run the Docker container again and see if it resolves the issue.
