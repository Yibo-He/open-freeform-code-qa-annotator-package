You can use the `$(cat file)` command substitution to include the contents of the file in the script. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will include the contents of the `file` in the `test.sh` script. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create the `test.sh` file with the desired output.
