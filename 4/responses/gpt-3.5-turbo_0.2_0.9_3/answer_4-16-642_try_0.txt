I understand your concern. One way to convert the hashtable to a PSCustomObject is to use the `ConvertTo-Json` and `ConvertFrom-Json` cmdlets. Here's an example:

```
$psdnode = Import-PowerShellDataFile .\nodefile.psd1

$json = $psdnode | ConvertTo-Json -Depth 10

$obj = $json | ConvertFrom-Json

$obj.AllNodes[0].NodeName
```

This will output `SRV1`, which is the value of the `NodeName` property of the first object in the `AllNodes` array.

By converting the hashtable to a PSCustomObject, you can navigate the data structure using dot notation, which is much easier to read and understand.
