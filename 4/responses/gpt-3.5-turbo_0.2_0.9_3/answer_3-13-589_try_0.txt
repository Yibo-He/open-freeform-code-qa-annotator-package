The error message suggests that there is a problem with the converter used to parse the response from the server into the `JConfig` object. 

One possible cause of this error is that the JSON response from the server does not match the structure of the `JConfig` object. You can try printing the response body to the console to see if it matches the expected structure.

Another possible cause is that the Moshi converter is not properly configured. In your `AppModule`, you are providing a `MoshiConverterFactory` instance, but you are not specifying the `Moshi` instance to use. You can try creating a `Moshi` instance with the `JsonClass` annotation processor and passing it to the `MoshiConverterFactory.create()` method, like this:

```
@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideConverterFactory(): MoshiConverterFactory {
    val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
        .add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory())
        .build()
    return MoshiConverterFactory.create(moshi)
}
```

Also, make sure that the `JConfig` and `Config` classes are properly annotated with the `@JsonClass` and `@Json` annotations, respectively.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
