To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to define a `fill` method that takes a `Content` view and returns a new view with the specified fill style. Here's an example implementation for your `RedView`:

```
struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func makeBody(configuration: Self.Configuration) -> some View {
        configuration.fill(Color.red)
    }
}
```

With this implementation, you can use `RedView()` directly as a fill style for any shape:

```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}
```

This will create a red circle with the specified fill style.
