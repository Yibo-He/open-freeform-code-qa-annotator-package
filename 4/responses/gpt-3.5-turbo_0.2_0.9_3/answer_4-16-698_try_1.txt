In MacOS, you can restart your current terminal session without closing the window by using the following command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This will reload your updated `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you made to it. 

Alternatively, you can also use the following command to reload your current shell:

```
exec $SHELL
```

This will restart your current shell session and apply any changes you made to your `.bash_profile` file.
