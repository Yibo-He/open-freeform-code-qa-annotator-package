You can add the `Az.Accounts` module as a dependency in your Azure DevOps pipeline. Here's how:

1. Go to your Azure DevOps project and select the pipeline you want to modify.
2. Click on the "Edit" button to open the pipeline editor.
3. Find the PowerShell task that invokes your script and click on it to open its settings.
4. Scroll down to the "Advanced" section and click on the "Add" button next to "Inline Script".
5. In the new field that appears, add the following command: `Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Force`.
6. Save your changes and run the pipeline again.

This will install the `Az.Accounts` module on the agent machine before running your script, so it should be able to find and load the module without any issues.
