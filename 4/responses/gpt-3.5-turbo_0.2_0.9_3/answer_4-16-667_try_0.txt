It seems like the issue is not with the file permissions or ownership, but with the environment variable `CATALINA_HOME`. The error message suggests that the script is unable to find the `setclasspath.sh` file in the specified directory.

You can try setting the `CATALINA_HOME` environment variable explicitly in your Dockerfile or in the container's environment variables. For example, add the following line to your Dockerfile:

```
ENV CATALINA_HOME /usr/local/tomcat
```

Alternatively, you can try modifying the `catalina.sh` script to print out the value of `CATALINA_HOME` and make sure it is set correctly. You can add the following line before the `if` statement:

```
echo "CATALINA_HOME is set to $CATALINA_HOME"
```

This will print out the value of `CATALINA_HOME` to the console when the script is run.

If the issue persists, you can try running the container with the `--privileged` flag to see if it is a permission issue. However, this is not recommended for security reasons and should only be used as a last resort.
