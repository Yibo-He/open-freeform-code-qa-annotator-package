It seems that the update has caused some issues with Access databases. One solution is to uninstall the update, but it's not recommended as it may leave your system vulnerable to security threats.

Instead, you can try the following workaround:

1. Open the Access database that contains the query.
2. Open the query in Design view.
3. Remove the WHERE clause from the query.
4. Save and close the query.
5. Open the query in SQL view.
6. Add the WHERE clause back to the query.
7. Save and close the query.
8. Try running the query again.

This workaround should allow you to run your queries without encountering the error. If the issue persists, you may need to contact Microsoft support for further assistance.
