To change the title of the Terminal window dynamically based on the currently running process, you can use the `PROMPT_COMMAND` environment variable in your `bash` shell.

Here's an example of how you can set the `PROMPT_COMMAND` variable to update the Terminal window title with the current working directory and the last executed command:

```
export PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${PWD##*/} (${BASH_COMMAND})\007"'
```

This will set the Terminal window title to the name of the current working directory and the last executed command. You can customize this to suit your needs.

You can add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file to make it persistent across Terminal sessions.
