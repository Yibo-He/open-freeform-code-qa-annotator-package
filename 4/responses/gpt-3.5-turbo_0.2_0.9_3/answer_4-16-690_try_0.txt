To set the environment variable permanently, you need to add the export command to the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` file. Here are the steps to do it:

1. Open the terminal and type the following command to open the `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```

Note: Replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.

3. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, and then `Enter`.

4. Type the following command to reload the `~/.bash_profile` file:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

5. Verify that the environment variable is set by typing the following command:

```
echo $JBOSS_HOME
```

You should see the path to your JBoss installation directory.

If you still can't see the environment variable, try adding the export command to the `~/.profile` file as well and repeat the above steps.
