You can use the `jq` command-line tool to achieve this. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. Here's how you can use it to uglify your JSON:

```
$ echo '{ "foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum" }' | jq -c '.'
```

The `-c` option tells `jq` to output the result in compact (uglified) form. The `.` argument is a filter that selects the entire input object.

The above command will output:

```
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can then pipe this output to another command, such as `httpie`, like this:

```
$ echo '{ "foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum" }' | jq -c '.' | http POST http://example.com/api -j
```

The `-j` option tells `httpie` to read the request body as JSON.
