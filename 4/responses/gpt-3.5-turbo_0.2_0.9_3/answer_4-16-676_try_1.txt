One possible solution to this problem is to use the Windows registry to store the required environment variables and then retrieve them in the elevated instance of the script. Here's how you can do it:

1. In the non-elevated instance of the script, set the required environment variables and then write them to the registry using the following command:

```
reg add HKCU\Environment /v VAR_NAME /t REG_SZ /d VAR_VALUE /f
```

Replace VAR_NAME and VAR_VALUE with the name and value of the environment variable you want to store.

2. In the elevated instance of the script, retrieve the environment variables from the registry using the following command:

```
$env:VAR_NAME = (Get-ItemProperty -Path "Registry::HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment" -Name VAR_NAME).VAR_NAME
```

Replace VAR_NAME with the name of the environment variable you want to retrieve.

3. You can now use the retrieved environment variables in the elevated instance of the script.

Note that this solution requires the script to have write access to the registry, which may not be possible in some environments. Also, storing sensitive information in the registry is not recommended.
