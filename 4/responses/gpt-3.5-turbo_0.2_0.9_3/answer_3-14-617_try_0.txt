The error message indicates that there was a problem with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command during the archive process. This could be caused by a variety of issues, such as missing dependencies or build settings.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check your build settings: Make sure that your build settings are correct and that all required dependencies are included. Check that the correct version of Xcode is being used and that the deployment target is set correctly.

2. Clean your project: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will remove any cached build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

3. Check your code: Check your code for any errors or warnings. Fix any issues that are found and try building again.

4. Update your pods: Update your pods to the latest version by running `pod update` in the terminal. This will ensure that you have the latest bug fixes and improvements.

5. Remove and re-add problematic pods: Try removing the problematic pods (`IQKeyboardManagerSwift`, `SDWebImage`, `KRPullLoader`, `Paytm-Payments`) from your project and then re-adding them. This can sometimes resolve issues with dependencies.

6. Try a different build configuration: Try building with a different build configuration (e.g. Debug instead of Release) to see if the issue persists.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to seek further assistance from a more experienced developer or the library's support team.
