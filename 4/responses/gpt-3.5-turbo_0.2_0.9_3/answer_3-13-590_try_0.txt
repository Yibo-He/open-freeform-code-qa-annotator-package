The error message indicates that the `TextInputLayout` requires the app theme to be `Theme.MaterialComponents` or a descendant. However, your app theme is defined as `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.DarkActionBar`. 

To fix this error, you can either change your app theme to `Theme.MaterialComponents` or a descendant, or you can override the theme for the specific activity where you are using the `TextInputLayout`. 

To override the theme for the activity, add the `android:theme` attribute to the activity tag in your `Manifest` file and set it to a theme that is a descendant of `Theme.MaterialComponents`. For example:

```
<activity
    android:name=".MyActivity"
    android:theme="@style/MyActivityTheme">
```

Then, define the `MyActivityTheme` in your `styles.xml` file as a descendant of `Theme.MaterialComponents`. For example:

```
<style name="MyActivityTheme" parent="Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar">
    <!-- Customize your theme here. -->
</style>
```

This will override the app theme for the specific activity and allow you to use the `TextInputLayout` without getting the inflate error.
