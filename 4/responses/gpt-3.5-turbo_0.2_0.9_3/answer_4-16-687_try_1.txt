To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the delimiter `-`.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one.
3. Join the words back together without any delimiter.

Here's an example code snippet that does this:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode('-', $var1);
$camelCase = $words[0] . implode('', array_map('ucfirst', array_slice($words, 1)));
echo $camelCase; // Output: "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow similar steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the delimiter `_`.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.
3. Join the words back together without any delimiter.

Here's an example code snippet that does this:

```
$var2 = "my_Name_is";
$words = explode('_', $var2);
$pascalCase = implode('', array_map('ucfirst', $words));
echo $pascalCase; // Output: "MyNameIs"
```
