You can use the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) variable to set the delimiter to a comma and then use the `echo` command to print the array elements separated by a comma. Here's an example:

```
IFS=','; echo "${data[*]}"
```

This will set the delimiter to a comma and then print the array elements separated by a comma. The output will be:

```
/QE-CI-RUN-71/workspace/QE-AU/57/testng-results_1.xml,/QE-CI-RUN-71/workspace/QE-AU/57/testng-results_2.xml
```

Note that the `IFS` variable is set only for the `echo` command and will not affect the rest of your script.
