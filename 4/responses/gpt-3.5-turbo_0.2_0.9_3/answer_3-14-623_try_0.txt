This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project or one of the pods. Here are some steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all the build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Check for any syntax errors: Go through your code and make sure there are no syntax errors or typos. If you're using a pod, check the pod's documentation to make sure you're using it correctly.

3. Check for any missing dependencies: Make sure all the required dependencies are installed and up-to-date. You can do this by running "pod install" in the terminal.

4. Check for any conflicting dependencies: Make sure there are no conflicting dependencies between your project and the pods you're using. You can use the "pod dependency" command to see a list of all the dependencies and their versions.

5. Try updating Xcode: If none of the above steps work, try updating Xcode to the latest version. This may fix any compatibility issues with the pods you're using.

If none of these steps work, you may need to reach out to the developers of the pods you're using for further assistance.
