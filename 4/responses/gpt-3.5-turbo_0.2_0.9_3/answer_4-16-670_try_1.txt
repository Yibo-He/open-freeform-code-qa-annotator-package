1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then it will ask you to enter a new passphrase (you can leave this blank if you don't want a passphrase). After that, your key will be converted to RSA format and saved in the same file.

2. You don't need to transfer your id_rsa.pub file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on the server, so you can use your newly converted RSA private key to access the server without any issues.
