It sounds like the issue may be with the button itself. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Delete the button and create a new one. Sometimes buttons can become corrupted and need to be recreated.

2. Check the properties of the button to make sure it is properly linked to the macro. Right-click on the button and select "Assign Macro". Make sure the correct macro is selected.

3. Check the security settings in Excel. If macros are disabled, the button will not work. Go to File > Options > Trust Center > Trust Center Settings. Make sure "Disable all macros without notification" is not selected.

4. Try running the macro from a different workbook. If the macro works in a different workbook, there may be an issue with the original workbook.

5. Check for any updates or changes to your Excel version. Sometimes updates can cause issues with macros and buttons.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get your button working again.
