It seems like there might be an issue with the network connection or the GitHub server. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check your internet connection and make sure it's stable.
2. Try running `brew update-reset` again to reset and update Homebrew.
3. Try running `brew update` again to update Homebrew.
4. Try running `brew doctor` again to check for any issues with your Homebrew installation.
5. Try running `git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask` to see if you can clone the repository manually. If this fails, it might indicate an issue with your network connection or GitHub server.
6. If none of the above steps work, you can try installing GLEW manually by downloading the source code from the GLEW website and building it yourself. Instructions for building GLEW can be found on their website.

If you continue to have issues, you can try reaching out to the Homebrew community for further assistance.
