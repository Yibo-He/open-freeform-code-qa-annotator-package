You can modify your script to extract only the required value from the SQL query output using the `grep` and `awk` commands. Here's an example:

```
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -S $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
set feedback off
set heading off
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF
)
size=$(echo $size | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*')
echo "Total data is ${size} GB"
```

In this modified script, we have added the following changes:

- We have added the `-S` option to `sqlplus` command to suppress unnecessary output.
- We have added `set feedback off` and `set heading off` commands to suppress SQL*Plus output.
- We have modified the SQL query to directly select the required value without the owner column.
- We have used `grep` command to extract the floating-point number from the SQL query output.
- We have assigned the extracted value to the `size` variable and used it in the output message.

This should give you the desired output with only the value of the SQL query output stored in the `size` variable.
