It seems like you are looking for a way to use globbing to match specific files or file types for various commands such as `ls`, `cp`, `cat`, `chown`, and `rm`. While globbing can be a powerful tool for matching files based on patterns, it may not always be the best solution for every use case.

In your specific example, you are looking to match only PHP files that contain a certain string. One way to achieve this is to use the `find` command with the `-name` and `-exec` options:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec grep "find me" {} \;
```

This will search for all PHP files in the current directory and its subdirectories, and then execute the `grep` command on each file that contains the string "find me".

For other commands such as `ls`, you can use globbing to match specific file types or patterns:

```
ls *.php      # matches all PHP files in the current directory
ls dir/*.txt  # matches all TXT files in the "dir" directory
```

You can also use globbing with other commands such as `cp`, `cat`, `chown`, and `rm`:

```
cp *.txt backup/      # copies all TXT files in the current directory to the "backup" directory
cat *.log             # concatenates all log files in the current directory
chown user:group *.sh # changes ownership of all shell scripts in the current directory
rm *.bak              # removes all backup files in the current directory
```

However, keep in mind that globbing can sometimes match unintended files or patterns, so it's important to double-check the results before executing any commands.
