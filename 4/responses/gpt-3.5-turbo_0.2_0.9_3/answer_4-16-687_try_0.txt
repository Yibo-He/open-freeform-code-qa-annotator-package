To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the hyphen as a delimiter.
2. Convert the first word to lowercase.
3. Convert the first letter of each subsequent word to uppercase.
4. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's some sample code in PHP:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode("-", $var1);
$camelCase = lcfirst(array_shift($words)) . implode("", array_map("ucfirst", $words));
echo $camelCase; // Outputs "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow similar steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the underscore as a delimiter.
2. Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase.
3. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's some sample code in PHP:

```
$var2 = "my_Name_is";
$words = explode("_", $var2);
$pascalCase = implode("", array_map("ucfirst", $words));
echo $pascalCase; // Outputs "MyNameIs"
```
