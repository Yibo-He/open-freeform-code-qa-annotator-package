The convention for character names used in Zsh is to use the name of the character preceded by "self-insert-". For example, the character "a" would be named "self-insert-a". 

In the case of the tab character, it is named "self-insert-tab". Therefore, you can replace "tab-char" with "self-insert-tab" in your config to set the tab key as an accept widget for the Zsh autosuggest plugin. 

Here's the updated code:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                self-insert-tab // updated line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```
