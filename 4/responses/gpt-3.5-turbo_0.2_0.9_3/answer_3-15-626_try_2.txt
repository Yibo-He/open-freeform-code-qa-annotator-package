It looks like you are trying to load data from a Power Query into a new sheet using VBA. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable
    Dim connString As String
    Dim queryName As String
    
    ' Set variables
    Set wb = ThisWorkbook
    Set ws = wb.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change to the name of your source sheet
    queryName = "Query - Sheet1" ' Change to the name of your Power Query
    
    ' Build connection string
    connString = "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=" & wb.FullName & ";Location=" & queryName
    
    ' Add QueryTable to new sheet
    Set qt = ws.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=xlSrcExternal, Source:=Array(connString), Destination:=Range("A1")).QueryTable
    
    ' Refresh QueryTable
    qt.Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    
End Sub
```

This code assumes that your Power Query is named "Query - Sheet1" and that you want to load the data into a new sheet. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs by changing the sheet names and query names.
