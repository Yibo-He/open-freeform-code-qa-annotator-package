Unfortunately, the latest version of CMake may not always be available in the default repositories of your Linux distribution. However, you can try adding a PPA (Personal Package Archive) to your system to get the latest version of CMake.

Here are the steps to install the latest version of CMake on Ubuntu:

1. Add the Kitware repository to your system:

```
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://apt.kitware.com/keys/kitware-archive-latest.asc
sudo apt-add-repository 'deb https://apt.kitware.com/ubuntu/ focal main'
```

Note: Replace "focal" with your Ubuntu version codename (e.g. bionic, xenial, etc.)

2. Update the package list:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

3. Install CMake:

```
sudo apt-get install cmake
```

This should install the latest version of CMake on your system. You can check the version by running:

```
cmake --version
```

I hope this helps!
