To set the environment variable permanently, you need to add the export command to the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` file. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` file in a text editor. You can use the following command to open the file in the nano editor:

   ```
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```

2. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```
   export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
   ```

   Replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.

3. Save the file by pressing `Ctrl+O` and then `Ctrl+X` to exit nano.

4. To apply the changes, either restart your terminal or run the following command:

   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   This will reload the `~/.bash_profile` file and apply the changes.

5. Finally, run the following command to check if the environment variable is set correctly:

   ```
   echo $JBOSS_HOME
   ```

   If everything is set up correctly, you should see the path to your JBoss installation.
