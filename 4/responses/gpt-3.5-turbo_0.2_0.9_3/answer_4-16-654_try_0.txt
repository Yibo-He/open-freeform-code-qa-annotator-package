To add your existing SSH key to Git Bash, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open Git Bash and navigate to your home directory by typing `cd ~` in the terminal.

2. Create a new directory called `.ssh` by typing `mkdir .ssh`.

3. Move your SSH key file to the `.ssh` directory by typing `mv D:/keys/id_rsa ~/.ssh/`.

4. Change the permissions of the SSH key file by typing `chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

5. Add the SSH key to the ssh-agent by typing `ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa`.

6. Verify that the SSH key has been added by typing `ssh-add -l`.

Now you should be able to clone a repository from a remote server using Git Bash.
