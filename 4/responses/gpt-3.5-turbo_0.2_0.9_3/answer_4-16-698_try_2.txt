In macOS, you can restart your current terminal session without closing the window by using the following command:

```
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will reload your `.bash_profile` file and apply any changes you have made to it. Your prompt and aliases should be updated immediately.

Alternatively, you can use the following command to start a new shell session within the same terminal window:

```
bash
```

This will start a new instance of the Bash shell within your current terminal window, allowing you to see any changes you have made to your `.bash_profile`.
