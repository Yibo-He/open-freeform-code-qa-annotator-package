It seems like the Flutter SDK is not properly installed or added to the system path. Here are the steps you can follow to fix this issue:

1. Check if Flutter is installed: Open a terminal window and run the following command:

   ```
   flutter --version
   ```

   If Flutter is not installed, you can follow the installation guide from the official Flutter website.

2. Add Flutter to the system path: If Flutter is installed but not added to the system path, you can add it manually. Here are the steps to add Flutter to the system path:

   - Open the terminal and run the following command to open the bash profile:

     ```
     nano ~/.bash_profile
     ```

   - Add the following lines at the end of the file:

     ```
     export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
     export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin"
     ```

     Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]` with the actual path to the Flutter SDK directory.

   - Save the file and exit the editor.

3. Refresh the terminal: Close and reopen the terminal window or run the following command to refresh the terminal:

   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

4. Verify Flutter installation: Run the following command to verify if Flutter is added to the system path:

   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```

   You should see the path to the Flutter SDK directory in the output.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Flutter commands in the terminal of Android Studio.
