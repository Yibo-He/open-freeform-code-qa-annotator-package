The error message suggests that there is a problem with the converter used to convert the response from the server into the `JConfig` object. 

One possible cause of this error is that the `MoshiConverterFactory` is not properly configured. Make sure that you have added the `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)` annotation to your `JConfig` and `Config` classes, as this is required for Moshi to generate the necessary adapter code.

Another possible cause of this error is that the server is returning a response that cannot be converted into the `JConfig` object. Check the response from the server to make sure that it is in the expected format.

You can also try adding a logging interceptor to your `OkHttpClient` to see the actual response from the server and debug the problem. To do this, add the following code to your `provideHttpClient` function:

```
@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
    val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
        level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY
    }
    return OkHttpClient
        .Builder()
        .readTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .connectTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
        .build()
}
```

This will log the response from the server to the console, which can help you identify the problem.
