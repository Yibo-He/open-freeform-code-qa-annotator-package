It seems like you are inflating the layout twice, once in the `onCreateView` method and once in the `val view` line. You should remove the `val view` line and use `_binding` to access the views in the layout. Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in `HomeFragment.kt`:

```
override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater,
    container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
    val root: View = binding.root

    _binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

    _binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
        Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        println("Generated a new exercise")
    }

    return root
}
```

Note that I also changed `view.context` to `requireContext()` in the `Toast.makeText` method, as it's a safer way to get the context in a fragment.
