The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the `android:name` attribute of the `<application>` tag. For example:

```
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...
```

Also, make sure that the `HomeActivity` is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file with the `android:name` attribute pointing to the fully qualified name of the `HomeActivity` class. For example:

```
<activity
    android:name="com.example.vcare.home.HomeActivity"
    ...
```

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project, and ensure that all dependencies are up to date.
