In Kotlin, you can use the `ArrayList` constructor that specifies an initial capacity just like in Java. The syntax is the same as in Java:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Type>(initialCapacity)
```

So, in your case, you can use this constructor to create a `MutableList` with an initial capacity. This should result in slightly faster code, as you mentioned.

Therefore, the recommended/idiomatic Kotlin solution in this case would be to use the `ArrayList` constructor with an initial capacity.
