It sounds like the output of the `aws` command is being piped to the `vi` editor instead of being displayed in the terminal. This can happen if the `EDITOR` environment variable is set to `vi` or if the `aws` command is aliased to `vi` in your shell configuration.

To check if `EDITOR` is set to `vi`, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```
echo $EDITOR
```

If it returns `vi`, you can unset it by running:

```
unset EDITOR
```

If that doesn't work, you can try running the `aws` command with the `-T` option to disable the use of the pager:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --output json -T
```

This should output the JSON string directly to the terminal.

If you want to make this change permanent, you can add the following line to your shell configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

This will disable the use of the pager for all `aws` commands.
