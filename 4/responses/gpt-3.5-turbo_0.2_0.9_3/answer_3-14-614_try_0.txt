It looks like you have the correct code for previewing your `ContentView` in the canvas. However, make sure that you have selected the preview canvas in Xcode. You can do this by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top left corner of the Xcode window, or by pressing "Command + Option + P" on your keyboard. If the canvas still doesn't show up, try cleaning your project and rebuilding it. You can do this by going to "Product" in the menu bar and selecting "Clean Build Folder", then rebuilding your project by pressing "Command + B" on your keyboard.
