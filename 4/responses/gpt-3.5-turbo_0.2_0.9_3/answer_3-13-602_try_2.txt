The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the `android:name` attribute of the `<application>` tag. 

Also, check that the `build.gradle` file of the app module includes the `kapt` plugin and the necessary dependencies for Hilt. 

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project.
