The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is correctly annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp` and is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the application class. 

Also, check if you have added the `HiltAndroidRule` in your test class if you are using Hilt for testing. 

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project.
