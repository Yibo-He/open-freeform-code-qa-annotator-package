To achieve your goal, you can modify the code to check the value of cell B14 and if it is "list1", then make the target cell a multiple selection list. Here's the modified code:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim rngDV As Range
    Dim oldVal As String
    Dim newVal As String
    
    On Error Resume Next
    
    If Target.Count > 1 Then GoTo exitsub
    
    Set rngDV = Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation)
    
    If rngDV Is Nothing Then GoTo exitsub
    
    If Intersect(Target, Range("B14")) Is Nothing Then GoTo exitsub
    
    If Target.Value = "list1" Then
        'make the target cell a multiple selection list
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=list1"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
    Else
        'make the target cell a single selection list
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=INDIRECT(B14)"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
    End If
    
exitsub:
    Application.EnableEvents = True
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
```

In this code, we first check if the changed cell has data validation applied to it. If it does, we check if the changed cell is B14. If it is, we check the value of B14. If it is "list1", we make the target cell a multiple selection list, otherwise, we make it a single selection list.

Note that in the code, we are deleting the existing validation and adding a new one with the appropriate formula. This is necessary because we cannot modify the existing validation formula directly.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.
