To add multiple paths to the PATH variable, you need to separate each path with a semicolon (;). Here's how you can do it:

1. Open the Environment Variables window by searching for "Environment Variables" in the Start menu and clicking on "Edit the system environment variables".

2. Click on the "Environment Variables" button.

3. Under "System Variables", select the "PATH" variable and click on "Edit".

4. In the "Edit environment variable" window, click on "New" and enter the first path you want to add.

5. Click on "New" again and enter the second path, and so on.

6. Make sure to separate each path with a semicolon (;).

7. Click on "OK" to close all the windows.

Alternatively, you can use the command line to add multiple paths to the PATH variable. Here's how:

1. Open the command prompt as an administrator.

2. Type the following command to add the first path:

   `setx path "%PATH%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m`

   This will append the MongoDB path to the existing PATH variable.

3. Type the following command to add the second path:

   `setx path "%PATH%;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_221\bin" /m`

   This will append the Java path to the existing PATH variable.

4. Make sure to separate each path with a semicolon (;).

5. Close the command prompt.

After adding the paths, you may need to restart any open command prompt or terminal windows for the changes to take effect.
