It seems like the VBA project may have become corrupted. Here are a few steps you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make a backup copy of the workbook before proceeding with any of the following steps.

2. Try opening the workbook in a different version of Excel. Sometimes, the issue may be related to a compatibility issue between the workbook and the version of Excel you are using.

3. Try opening the workbook in safe mode. To do this, hold down the Ctrl key while opening Excel. This will prevent any add-ins or macros from running, which may be causing the issue.

4. Try exporting the modules to a new workbook. To do this, open a new workbook and go to the VBE. From there, select the module you want to export, right-click, and select "Export File". Save the module to a new workbook and see if you can open it there.

5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to recreate the VBA project. To do this, go to the VBE and select "Tools" > "References". Uncheck any references that are not needed and then save and close the workbook. Reopen the workbook and re-add the necessary references.

If none of these steps work, you may need to seek further assistance from a VBA expert or Microsoft support.
