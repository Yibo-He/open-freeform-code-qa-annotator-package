To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2
```

This command will display the name of the current branch. You can add this command to your PS1 environment variable to display the branch name in your terminal prompt.

To add this command to your PS1 environment variable, you can add the following line to your .bashrc file:

```
export PS1='\u@\h:\w $(git branch 2>/dev/null | grep -e ^* | sed -E s/^\\\\\*\ \(.+\)$/\(\\\\\1\)\ /) $ '
```

This will display the current branch name in parentheses in your terminal prompt.
