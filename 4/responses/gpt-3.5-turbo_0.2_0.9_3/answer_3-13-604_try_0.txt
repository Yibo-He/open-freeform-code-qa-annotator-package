It seems like you are inflating the layout twice, once in the `onCreateView` method and once in the `setOnClickListener` method. You should only inflate the layout once in the `onCreateView` method and then use the `_binding` variable to access the views in that layout.

Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in the `HomeFragment.kt` file:

```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        // Access the exercise EditText using the _binding variable
        _binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        val btnNewExercise = _binding.btnNewExercise
        btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }

        return root
    }
```

Make sure that you have also defined the `exercise` EditText and `btn_new_exercise` Button in the `fragment_home.xml` layout file and that you have initialized the `_binding` variable at the top of the `HomeFragment.kt` file.
