To create a reference plane using a selected face and point, you can use the following steps:

1. Get the handle for the selected face and point objects.
2. Create a reference point on the selected edge using the `CreatePoint` method of the `ModelDocExtension` object.
3. Use the `SelectByID2` method to select the face and point objects.
4. Use the `InsertRefPlane` method of the `FeatureManager` object to create the reference plane.

Here is the updated code:

```
Dim swApp As SldWorks.SldWorks
Dim swModel As SldWorks.ModelDoc2
Dim swPart As SldWorks.PartDoc
Dim swSelMgr As SldWorks.SelectionMgr
Dim swModelDocExt As SldWorks.ModelDocExtension
Dim swFeatMgr As SldWorks.FeatureManager

Dim selBool As Boolean
Dim longstatus As Long, longwarnings As Long

Sub main()

Set swApp = Application.SldWorks
Set swModel = swApp.ActiveDoc
Set swModelDocExt = swModel.Extension
Set swPart = swModel
Set swSelMgr = swModel.SelectionManager
Set swFeatMgr = swModel.FeatureManager

' Check which file is opened
Dim filePath As String: filePath = swModel.GetPathName()
Debug.Print "File path is:" & filePath

'   User has to select the face and the edge of the body to create plane and
'   sketch to convert face entities
' Gets selection from SelectionManager
Dim numSelectedObjs As Long
Dim selectionMark As Long: selectionMark = -1

numSelectedObjs = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectCount2(selectionMark)
Debug.Print "Number of selected objects:" & numSelectedObjs

Dim faceObj As SldWorks.Face2
Dim edgeObj As SldWorks.Edge
Dim midpointObj As Object

If (numSelectedObjs > 0) Then
    ' Get and validate selection
    Dim selObj As Object
    Dim selObjIndex As Long
    Dim selObjType As Long
    For selObjIndex = 1 To numSelectedObjs ' This method uses 1 as first index
        selObjType = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObjectType3(selObjIndex, selectionMark)
        ' Check selected object type and assign it to appropriate variable
        If (selObjType = SwConst.swSelFACES) Then
            Set faceObj = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(selObjIndex, selectionMark)
            Dim faceFeat As Object
            Set faceFeat = faceObj.GetFeature()
        ElseIf (selObjType = SwConst.swSelEDGES) Then
            Set edgeObj = swSelMgr.GetSelectedObject6(selObjIndex, selectionMark)
            midpointObj = swModelDocExt.CreatePoint(edgeObj.GetStartVertex().GetPoint())
        Else
            MsgBox "Wrong objects selected, select only face and edge"
            Exit For
        End If
    Next
End If

' Select the face and point objects
Dim faceName As String: faceName = faceObj.GetNameForSelection()
Dim pointName As String: pointName = midpointObj.GetNameForSelection()
Dim objType As Long: objType = SwConst.swSelectType_e.swSelFACES + SwConst.swSelectType_e.swSelPOINTS
Dim selAppend As Boolean: selAppend = True
Dim objMark As Long: objMark = 0
Dim objCallout As Callout
Dim selOption As swSelectOption_e: selOption = 0

selBool = swModel.Extension.SelectByID2(faceName, objType, 0, 0, 0, selAppend, objMark, objCallout, selOption)
selBool = swModel.Extension.SelectByID2(pointName, objType, 0, 0, 0, selAppend, objMark, objCallout, selOption)

' Create reference plane using face and a point
swFeatMgr.InsertRefPlane swRefPlaneReference, False, False, False

End Sub
```

In this updated code, we create a reference point on the selected edge using the `CreatePoint` method of the `ModelDocExtension` object. We then use the `GetNameForSelection` method to get the names of the selected face and point objects, and use the `SelectByID2` method to select them. Finally, we use the `InsertRefPlane` method of the `FeatureManager` object to create the reference plane.
