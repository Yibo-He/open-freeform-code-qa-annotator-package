You can use the `jq` command-line tool to achieve this. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor.

To uglify your JSON, you can pipe it to `jq` and use the `-c` option to output the JSON in compact form:

```
$ echo '{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}' | jq -c
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can then use this output in another command, such as `httpie`:

```
$ echo '{"foo": "lorem", "bar": "ipsum"}' | jq -c | http POST http://example.com/api/data
```

This will send the uglified JSON to the specified URL using the `POST` method.
