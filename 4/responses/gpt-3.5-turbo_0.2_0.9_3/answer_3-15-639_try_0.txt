It sounds like the issue may be with the button itself. Here are a few things you can try:

1. Check that the button is properly linked to the macro. Right-click on the button and select "Assign Macro". Make sure the correct macro is selected.

2. Check that the button is enabled. Sometimes buttons can become disabled, which would prevent them from running the macro. Right-click on the button and select "Format Control". Under the "Control" tab, make sure the "Enabled" checkbox is selected.

3. Try deleting the button and creating a new one. Sometimes buttons can become corrupted, which would prevent them from running the macro. Delete the existing button and create a new one. Then, assign the macro to the new button.

4. Check that the button is not hidden or obscured. Make sure the button is visible and not covered by any other objects on the sheet.

Hopefully one of these solutions will help you get your macros working again via buttons.
