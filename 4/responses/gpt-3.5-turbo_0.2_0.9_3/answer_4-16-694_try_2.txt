You can use a regular expression to extract the language code from the HTML code. Here's an example using `grep` and `sed`:

```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+' | sed -n 1p
```

Explanation:

- `grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+'` searches for the string `lang="` and extracts all characters that follow until the next double quote.
- `sed -n 1p` prints only the first line of the output (in case there are multiple matches).

This should work for both cases where the language code is written as `lang="he-IL"` or `lang="he_IL"`.
