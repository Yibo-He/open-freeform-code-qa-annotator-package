You can use the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) variable to set the delimiter to a comma and then use the `echo` command to print the array with the delimiter. Here's an example:

```
IFS=','; echo "${data[*]}"
```

This will print the array with each element separated by a comma. If you want to store the output in a variable, you can use command substitution like this:

```
csv=$(IFS=','; echo "${data[*]}")
```

This will store the comma-separated values in the `csv` variable.
