The error message suggests that there is a problem with the converter used to convert the response from the server into the `JConfig` object. 

One possible solution is to check if the `JConfig` class is properly annotated with `@JsonClass(generateAdapter = true)` and all the fields of the `Config` class are annotated with `@Json(name = "fieldName")` where `fieldName` is the name of the corresponding field in the JSON response.

Another possible solution is to check if the `MoshiConverterFactory` is properly configured. Make sure that the `MoshiConverterFactory` is created with the `Moshi` instance that has the necessary adapters for the `JConfig` and `Config` classes. You can create a `Moshi` instance with the necessary adapters like this:

```
val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
    .add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory())
    .build()
```

Then, pass this `Moshi` instance to the `MoshiConverterFactory` like this:

```
@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideConverterFactory(): MoshiConverterFactory {
    val moshi = Moshi.Builder()
        .add(KotlinJsonAdapterFactory())
        .build()
    return MoshiConverterFactory.create(moshi)
}
```

Also, make sure that the `MoshiConverterFactory` is added to the `Retrofit` instance like this:

```
@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideRetrofit(
    okHttpClient: OkHttpClient,
    moshiConverterFactory: MoshiConverterFactory
): Retrofit {
    return Retrofit.Builder()
        .baseUrl(BASE_URL)
        .client(okHttpClient)
        .addConverterFactory(moshiConverterFactory)
        .build()
}
```

If the above solutions do not work, you can try to add logging to the `OkHttpClient` to see the actual response from the server and debug the issue. You can add logging to the `OkHttpClient` like this:

```
@Singleton
@Provides
fun provideHttpClient(): OkHttpClient {
    val loggingInterceptor = HttpLoggingInterceptor().apply {
        level = HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BODY
    }
    return OkHttpClient
        .Builder()
        .readTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .connectTimeout(15, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
        .addInterceptor(loggingInterceptor)
        .build()
}
```

This will log the HTTP request and response to the console, which can help you identify the issue.
