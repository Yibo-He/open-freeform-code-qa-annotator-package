To achieve your desired result, you can modify the code as follows:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim rngDV As Range
    Dim oldVal As String
    Dim newVal As String
    
    On Error Resume Next
    
    If Target.Count > 1 Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    Set rngDV = Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation)
    
    If rngDV Is Nothing Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    If Not Intersect(Target, Range("B14")) Is Nothing Then
        If Target.Value = "list1" Then
            Target.Offset(1, 0).ClearContents
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.Delete
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.Add xlValidateList, xlValidAlertStop, xlBetween, "=list1"
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.InCellDropdown = True
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.ShowError = False
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Select
            Exit Sub
        End If
    End If
    
    Application.EnableEvents = False
    newVal = Target.Value
    
    Application.Undo
    oldVal = Target.Value
    Target.Value = newVal
    
    If Target.Column = 4 And Target.Row > 13 Then
        If Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1) = "=list1" Then
            Target.Validation.Delete
            Target.Validation.Add xlValidateList, xlValidAlertStop, xlBetween, "=list1"
            Target.Validation.InCellDropdown = True
            Target.Validation.ShowError = False
            Target.Select
            Target.Value = oldVal
        End If
    End If
    
    Application.EnableEvents = True
    
    Exitsub:
        Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, we first check if the changed cell is B14 and its value is "list1". If it is, we clear the cell below it (D15 in your example), delete its validation, and add a new validation with the source "=list1" and InCellDropdown set to True. This will make the cell a multiple selection drop-down list.

If the changed cell is not B14 or its value is not "list1", we proceed with the rest of the code as before. However, we add an additional check to see if the validation formula of the changed cell is "=list1". If it is, we delete its validation, add a new validation with the source "=list1" and InCellDropdown set to True, and restore its old value. This will make the cell a multiple selection drop-down list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
