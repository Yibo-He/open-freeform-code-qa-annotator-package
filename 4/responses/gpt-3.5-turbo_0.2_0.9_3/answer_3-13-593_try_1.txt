To use Jetpack Compose in an existing Android Studio project, you need to follow these steps:

1. Update your Android Studio to the latest version (4.2 or higher) and make sure you have the latest version of the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) installed.

2. Add the following dependencies to your app-level build.gradle file:

```
dependencies {
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.material:material:1.0.0"
    implementation "androidx.compose.ui:ui-tooling:1.0.0"
}
```

3. Add the following code to your app-level build.gradle file to enable Jetpack Compose:

```
android {
    ...
    buildFeatures {
        compose true
    }
    ...
}
```

4. Sync your project with Gradle.

5. Create a new Composable function in your existing activity or fragment. You can start by replacing the existing layout with a Composable function.

6. Run your app and make sure everything works as expected.

Note: If you encounter any issues, make sure to check the Jetpack Compose documentation and the Android Studio release notes for any updates or changes.
