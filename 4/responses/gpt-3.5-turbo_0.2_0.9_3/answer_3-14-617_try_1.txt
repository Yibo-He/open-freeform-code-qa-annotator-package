The error message indicates that there was a problem with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command during the archive process. This could be caused by a number of issues, such as missing dependencies or build settings.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check your build settings: Make sure that your build settings are correct and that all required dependencies are included. You can check this by going to your project settings and looking at the Build Phases tab.

2. Clean your project: Try cleaning your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode. This will remove any temporary files and build artifacts that may be causing the issue.

3. Update your pods: Make sure that your pods are up to date by running `pod update` in your project directory. This will update all of your pods to their latest versions.

4. Check for conflicts: Make sure that there are no conflicts between your pods and other dependencies in your project. You can check this by running `pod outdated` in your project directory.

5. Try a different version of Xcode: If none of the above steps work, try using a different version of Xcode. Sometimes, certain versions of Xcode can have issues with specific libraries or dependencies.

If none of these steps work, you may need to consult the documentation for the specific library or dependency that is causing the issue, or seek help from the library's support team.
