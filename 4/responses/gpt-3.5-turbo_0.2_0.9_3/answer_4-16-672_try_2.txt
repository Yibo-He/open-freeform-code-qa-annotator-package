You can use the `cat` command with the file name as an argument inside the `cat << EOF` block to achieve the desired output. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will insert the contents of `file` into the `test.sh` script at the position where `$(cat file)` is located. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create the `test.sh` file with the desired output.
