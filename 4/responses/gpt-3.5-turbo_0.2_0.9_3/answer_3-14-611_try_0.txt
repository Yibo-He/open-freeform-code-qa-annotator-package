You can add spacing between `List` items by using the `.listRowBackground()` modifier and setting a background color with a padding. Here's an example:

```
List (ratesVM.ratesList, id: \.self) { rate in
    Button(action: {print("pressed")}) {
        Text(rate.hebrewCurrencyName)
    }
    .listRowBackground(Color.green.padding(.vertical, 8))
}
```

This will add 8 points of vertical padding between each `List` item and set the background color to green. You can adjust the padding value to your liking.
