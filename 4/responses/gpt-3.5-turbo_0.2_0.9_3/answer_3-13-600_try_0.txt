To achieve this behavior, you can set the `ViewPager2`'s `offscreenPageLimit` to 0. This will prevent the `ViewPager2` from preloading any pages, and will only load the page when it is selected by the user via the `TabLayout`.

Here's an example of how to do it:

```kotlin
// Set the offscreenPageLimit to 0
viewPager2.offscreenPageLimit = 0

// Set up the TabLayout with the ViewPager2
TabLayoutMediator(tabLayout, viewPager2) { tab, position ->
    // Set the tab text and icon here
}.attach()

// Disable user input for the ViewPager2
viewPager2.isUserInputEnabled = false
```

With this setup, when the user clicks on a tab in the `TabLayout`, the `ViewPager2` will only load the selected page and display it immediately, without any animation or preloading of other pages.
