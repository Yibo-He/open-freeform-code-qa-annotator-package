The error message you are receiving indicates that the file system is mounted as read-only, which means that you cannot create new directories or modify existing files. 

To resolve this issue, you need to remount the file system as read-write. You can do this by running the following command:

```
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
```

This will remount the root file system as read-write, allowing you to create new directories and modify files. Once you have done this, you can try creating the new folder again using the `mkdir` command.
