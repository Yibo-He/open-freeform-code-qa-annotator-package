You can use the `Get-ChildItem` command with the `-Name` parameter to only retrieve the names of the files and folders. Then, you can pipe the output to the `Out-File` command to write it to a file. Here's an example:

```
Get-ChildItem -Name | Out-File .gitignore
```

This will write all the file and folder names in the current directory to a file named `.gitignore`. If you want to exclude certain files or folders, you can use the `-Exclude` parameter with `Get-ChildItem`. For example:

```
Get-ChildItem -Name -Exclude *.txt,Folder1 | Out-File .gitignore
```

This will exclude all files with the `.txt` extension and the folder named `Folder1` from the output. You can customize the `-Exclude` parameter to fit your needs.
