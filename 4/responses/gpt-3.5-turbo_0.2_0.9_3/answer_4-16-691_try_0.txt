It seems like the Flutter SDK is not properly installed or added to the system path. Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. First, make sure that you have installed the Flutter SDK on your system. You can download it from the official Flutter website.

2. Once you have downloaded the Flutter SDK, extract the contents of the archive to a suitable location on your system.

3. Next, add the Flutter SDK to your system path. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]/bin"
   ```

   Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]` with the actual path to the Flutter SDK on your system.

4. Finally, verify that the Flutter SDK is properly installed and added to the system path by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

   This command will check your system for any missing dependencies and provide guidance on how to install them.
