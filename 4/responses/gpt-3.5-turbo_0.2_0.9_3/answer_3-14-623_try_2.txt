This error can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as outdated pods, incompatible Swift versions, or missing frameworks. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check the version of Swift used in your project and make sure it is compatible with the version used in the pods. You can do this by checking the Podfile.lock file.

2. Update your pods to the latest version by running the command "pod update" in your project directory.

3. Clean your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode or by running the command "clean" in the terminal.

4. Check if any of the pods have missing frameworks or dependencies. You can do this by opening the pod's .xcworkspace file and checking for any errors or missing files.

5. If none of the above steps work, try removing the problematic pods and adding them back again.

If the issue still persists, you can try reaching out to the developers of the problematic pods for further assistance.
