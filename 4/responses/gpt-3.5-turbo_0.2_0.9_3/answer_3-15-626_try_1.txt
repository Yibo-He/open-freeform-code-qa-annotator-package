It looks like you are trying to use VBA to load data from a Power Query into a new worksheet. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim myWorkbook As Workbook
    Dim myWorksheet As Worksheet
    Dim myQuery As WorkbookQuery
    
    ' Set references to workbook and worksheet
    Set myWorkbook = ThisWorkbook
    Set myWorksheet = myWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    ' Set reference to Power Query
    Set myQuery = myWorkbook.Queries("MyPowerQuery")
    
    ' Refresh the Power Query
    myQuery.Refresh
    
    ' Load the data into a new worksheet
    myQuery.Result.LoadToWorksheet myWorksheet.Range("A1")
    
End Sub
```

In this code, you first define variables for your workbook, worksheet, and Power Query. Then, you set references to those objects using the `Set` keyword. 

Next, you refresh the Power Query using the `Refresh` method. This ensures that the data is up-to-date before you load it into your worksheet.

Finally, you use the `LoadToWorksheet` method to load the data into a new worksheet. In this example, the data is loaded into cell A1 of Sheet1. You can modify this to fit your specific needs.

Note that this code assumes that you have already created a Power Query and named it "MyPowerQuery". If you have a different name for your query, you will need to modify the code accordingly.
