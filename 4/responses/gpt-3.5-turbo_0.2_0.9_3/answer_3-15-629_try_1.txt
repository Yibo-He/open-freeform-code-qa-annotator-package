You can use the `Clipboard.SetText` method to copy the text value to the Windows clipboard. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Dim textValue As String
textValue = "Your text value here"
Clipboard.SetText textValue
```

Regarding your issue with copying the node path value into the Windows clipboard, you can try using the `DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy` method after setting the focus to the node key control. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy
```

If this doesn't work, you can try using the `SendKeys` method to simulate the Ctrl+C key combination. Here's an example code snippet:

```
Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
SendKeys "^c"
```

This should copy the node path value to the Windows clipboard.
