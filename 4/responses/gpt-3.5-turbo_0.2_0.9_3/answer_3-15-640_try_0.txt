It seems like the VBA project in your workbook has become corrupted. This can happen due to various reasons, such as a sudden power outage or a virus infection.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Open the workbook in a different version of Excel: Sometimes, the issue can be caused by a compatibility issue between the workbook and the version of Excel you are using. Try opening the workbook in a different version of Excel to see if the issue persists.

2. Use a backup copy: If you have a backup copy of the workbook, try opening it to see if the VBA project is intact. If it is, you can copy the VBA code from the backup copy and paste it into the corrupted workbook.

3. Use a VBA recovery tool: There are several third-party tools available that can help recover a corrupted VBA project. You can try using one of these tools to see if it can recover your code.

4. Recreate the VBA project: If all else fails, you may need to recreate the VBA project from scratch. This can be time-consuming, but it will ensure that your code is free from any corruption.

It's always a good idea to make regular backups of your workbooks to avoid losing important data.
