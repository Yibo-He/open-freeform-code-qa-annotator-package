It seems like the issue is with the way you are defining the command in your YAML file. When you enclose the command in quotes, Kubernetes treats it as a single string and tries to set it as an immutable field. To fix this, you can define the command as an array of strings instead of a single string. Here's an example:

```
args:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - |
    /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
    CHILD_PID=$!
    (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
    wait 
    if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```

In this example, we define the command as an array of strings, where the first element is the path to the shell (`/bin/bash`), the second element (`-c`) tells the shell to execute the command that follows, and the third element is the actual command that you want to execute. 

Try updating your YAML file with this format and see if it resolves the issue.
