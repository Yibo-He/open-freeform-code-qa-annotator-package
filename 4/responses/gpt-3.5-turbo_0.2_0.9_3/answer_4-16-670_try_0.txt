1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then allow you to choose a new passphrase (if desired). The resulting key will be in PEM format and will start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

2. Yes, you should also transfer your id_rsa.pub file to the server administrator, as this is the public key that corresponds to your private key. You can simply copy the contents of the file and provide it to the administrator. The lack of a header in the id_rsa.pub file is not an issue, as it is still a valid public key.
