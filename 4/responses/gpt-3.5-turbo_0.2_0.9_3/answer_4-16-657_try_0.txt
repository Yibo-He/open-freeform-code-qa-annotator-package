Yes, you can output bold text in PowerShell by using the escape sequence for bold text. Here's an example:

```
Write-Host "This is normal text. This is $(tput bold)bold$(tput sgr0) text."
```

In this example, `$(tput bold)` is the escape sequence for bold text, and `$(tput sgr0)` resets the text formatting back to normal. You can replace "bold" with any text that you want to output in bold.

Note that this may not work in all PowerShell environments, as it relies on the `tput` command being available. If it doesn't work for you, you may need to look for an alternative method of outputting bold text.
