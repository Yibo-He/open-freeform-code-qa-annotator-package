You can use the `Split-Path` cmdlet to split the PATH environment variable into an array of directories, and then use the `Contains` method to check if the specified directory is in the array. Here's the updated function:

```
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    $path_dirs = $env:Path -split ';'
    return $path_dirs.Contains($Path_to_directory)
}
```

This function takes a path to a directory as an argument and returns `true` if the directory is in the PATH environment variable, and `false` otherwise.
