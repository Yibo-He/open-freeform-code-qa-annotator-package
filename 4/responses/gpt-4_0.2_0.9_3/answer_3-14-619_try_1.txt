The code you provided is correct, but it seems like you're trying to use it in a standalone way. The `@Binding` property wrapper is used to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. 

In your case, `isSelected` is a binding variable in `ContentView` which means it doesn't own the data but it can read and write it. The owner of the data is the `selected` state property in `ContentView_Previews`.

The problem is that you're trying to use `ContentView` alone. It needs to be used as a part of another view which provides the binding. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var selected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
            Text("Current selection: \(selected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ParentView()
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` is the owner of the data and it passes a binding to this data to `ContentView`. When you click the button in `ContentView`, it updates the `selected` state in `ParentView` and the text in `ParentView` changes accordingly.
