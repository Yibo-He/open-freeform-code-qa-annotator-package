This alert is indicating that the app you're trying to open is a developer-signed app, and you need to trust the developer on your device before you can use it. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "General".
3. Scroll down to "Device Management" or "Profiles & Device Management". 
4. Under the "Developer App" section, you should see the developer of the app you're trying to open. Tap on it.
5. You'll see a blue "Trust" button. Tap on it, and when the confirmation alert pops up, tap "Trust" again.

After doing this, you should be able to open and use the app. If the problem persists, it might be due to the fact that the app was built with a developer profile that doesn't match the one on your device. In this case, you'll need to get a new build of the app that's signed with the correct developer profile.
