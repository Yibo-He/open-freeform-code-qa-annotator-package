The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify mutability for your `PendingIntent`s. This is a new requirement in Android 12 to improve app security.

The AndroidX Media library has been updated to handle this requirement, but it seems like you're still encountering an issue. This might be due to the fact that the library is using the `Build.VERSION.CODENAME` to check the Android version, which is not a reliable way to do it.

As a workaround, you can try to create the `PendingIntent` yourself and pass it to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor that takes a `PendingIntent` as an argument.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()

  val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
  mediaButtonIntent.setComponent(ComponentName(this, MediaService::class.java))
  val mbrIntent = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S) {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
  } else {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, 0)
  }

  mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG, mbrIntent, null).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
  }
...
```

This way, you're creating the `PendingIntent` yourself and you're specifying the mutability based on the Android version. You're then passing this `PendingIntent` to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor.

Please note that this is a workaround and the issue should be properly fixed in a future version of the AndroidX Media library.
