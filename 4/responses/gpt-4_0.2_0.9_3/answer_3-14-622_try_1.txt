The error message is telling you that the `fill` method requires a `ShapeStyle` as its parameter, but you're trying to pass a `View`. `Color.red` is a `ShapeStyle`, but `RedView` is a `View`.

To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you can make `RedView` a `ShapeStyle` instead of a `View`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}

struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedView` is a `ShapeStyle` that applies `Color.red` to the shape it's used with. Now you can use `RedView()` as a `ShapeStyle` in your `fill` method.
