The issue you're facing is due to the fact that `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` is trying to evaluate the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)`, which is a reference to a cell, not a value. 

To solve this, you need to first evaluate the cell reference `B14` to get the value it contains, and then compare that value to `"list1"`. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)

If rng.Value = "list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

This code first evaluates the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)` to get the range it refers to, then gets the value of that range, and finally compares it to `"list1"`.

However, you should be aware that this code will only work if `B14` contains a valid cell reference. If `B14` contains an error value or a value that is not a valid cell reference, `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` will raise an error. To handle this, you can use error handling code like this:

```vba
On Error Resume Next
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)
On Error GoTo 0

If Not rng Is Nothing Then
    If rng.Value = "list1" Then
        ' Your code here
    End If
End If
```

This code will ignore any errors raised by `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)`, and if no error is raised, it will proceed to compare the value of the range to `"list1"`. If an error is raised, `rng` will be `Nothing`, and the comparison will be skipped.
