In MacOS, you can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, it will apply those changes to your current terminal session.

Note: If you're using zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you should modify `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile`, and you can reload it with `source ~/.zshrc`.
