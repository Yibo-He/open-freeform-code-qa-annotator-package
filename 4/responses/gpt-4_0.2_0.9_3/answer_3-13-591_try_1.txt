The reason why you are seeing log 2 before log 1 is because of the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is not called immediately when you set the listener, it is called later when an item is actually selected in the spinner. 

However, the `return` statement and the log 2 are executed immediately after you set the listener, not waiting for an item to be selected. That's why you see log 2 before log 1, and why the function returns an empty string if no item has been selected yet.

To fix this, you could use a callback function to return the selected item when it is actually selected. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected) // call the callback function with the selected item
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then you can use the function like this:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // do something with selectedItem
}
```

This way, the `selectedItem` is returned to you as soon as it is selected in the spinner.
