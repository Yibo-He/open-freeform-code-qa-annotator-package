It seems like your AWS CLI is configured to use `vi` as the default pager. The AWS CLI uses a pager to handle the output of its commands. By default, it uses the pager specified by the `PAGER` environment variable. If this variable is not set, it will use `less` as the default pager.

You can change the pager used by the AWS CLI by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable. If you want to disable the pager and print the output directly to the terminal, you can set `AWS_PAGER` to an empty string.

Here's how you can do this:

1. Open your `.zshrc` file:

```bash
nano ~/.zshrc
```

2. Add the following line to the end of the file:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

3. Save and close the file.

4. Apply the changes by running:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Now, when you run your AWS CLI commands, the output should be printed directly to the terminal.

If you want to set this change only for the current terminal session, you can simply run `export AWS_PAGER=""` directly in the terminal.
