Setting environment variables in `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` should work, but you need to make sure that these files are actually being sourced when you start a new terminal session. 

Here are the steps to set the environment variable:

1. Open `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` with a text editor. If they don't exist, you can create them.

2. Add the following line to both files:

    ```
    export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
    ```

    Replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.

3. Save and close the files.

4. Now, you need to source these files to apply the changes. You can do this by restarting your terminal or using the `source` command:

    ```
    source ~/.bash_profile
    source ~/.profile
    ```

5. Now, if you echo `$JBOSS_HOME`, you should see the path you set:

    ```
    echo $JBOSS_HOME
    ```

If this still doesn't work, it's possible that your terminal is not using bash. You can check your default shell with the following command:

```
echo $SHELL
```

If it's not bash (for example, it might be zsh), you'll need to add the `export` line to the appropriate configuration file for that shell (for example, `~/.zshrc` for zsh).
