1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. Here is the command you need to run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) and then rewrite the private key in place with the RSA version. The `-p` option tells ssh-keygen to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. No, you don't need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have the same OpenSSH vs RSA format issue. The public key file (id_rsa.pub) can be used as is. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key because it's a simpler format, just a single line of text.
