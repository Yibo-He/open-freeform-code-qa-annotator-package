The error you're seeing is related to Git, not Homebrew or GLEW. It seems that Git is having trouble cloning the repository. This can be due to a variety of reasons such as network issues, GitHub server problems, or local machine problems.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection. Try to clone another repository to see if the problem persists.

2. **Increase Git's HTTP buffer size**: Sometimes, this error can occur if the repository is large and Git's HTTP buffer isn't large enough to handle it. You can increase the buffer size with the following command:

    ```
    git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
    ```

3. **Change the cloning method**: If increasing the buffer size doesn't work, you can try to change the cloning method from HTTPS to SSH or vice versa. If you're using HTTPS, you can switch to SSH by using the following command:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:Homebrew/homebrew-cask.git
    ```

    If you're using SSH, you can switch to HTTPS by using the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask.git
    ```

4. **Check for any firewall or VPN that might be interfering**: If you're behind a firewall or using a VPN, it might be interfering with Git. Try disabling them temporarily to see if that solves the problem.

5. **Try to manually download and install GLEW**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try to manually download and install GLEW. You can download it from the official website, extract the files, and follow the installation instructions provided.

Remember to replace the URLs in the clone commands with the URL of the repository you're trying to clone.
