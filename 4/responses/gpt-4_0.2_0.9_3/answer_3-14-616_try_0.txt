The error is occurring because you are trying to use `card` as an index to access elements in `properties`. However, `card` is not an index, it's an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`.

In your `ForEach` loop, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert` that you are iterating over. So, you don't need to use it as an index to access `properties`. You can directly use `card.label` and `card.value`.

Here is the corrected code:

```swift
ForEach(properties) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert` that you are iterating over in the `ForEach` loop. You can directly access its `label` and `value` properties.
