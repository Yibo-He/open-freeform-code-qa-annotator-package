The error you're seeing is related to the Kotlin compiler and not directly related to your usage of Navigation SafeArgs. 

Here are a few things you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild the project:** This is the simplest solution and it often works. Go to `Build > Clean Project` and then `Build > Rebuild Project`.

2. **Invalidate Caches and Restart:** Sometimes, the caches of the IDE can cause issues. You can clear them by going to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

3. **Update Kotlin Plugin:** Make sure you're using the latest version of the Kotlin plugin. You can check for updates by going to `File > Settings > Plugins > Installed > Kotlin > Update`.

4. **Update Gradle Plugin:** Similarly, make sure you're using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin. You can update it in your project-level `build.gradle` file.

5. **Check for conflicting dependencies:** Make sure there are no conflicting dependencies in your `build.gradle` files. For example, you might have different versions of the same library or libraries that are not compatible with each other.

6. **Check your code for errors:** Make sure there are no errors in your Kotlin code. The error message suggests that there might be an issue with the `FavDish` class or the way it's used.

7. **Try using a different version of Kotlin:** Sometimes, certain versions of Kotlin can have bugs. You can try downgrading or upgrading your Kotlin version to see if it resolves the issue.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider creating a new project and gradually moving your code over to see if you can isolate the issue.
