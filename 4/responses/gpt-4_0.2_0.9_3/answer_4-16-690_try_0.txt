The issue might be due to the fact that `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile` is not being sourced when you open a new terminal. 

Here are the steps to set the environment variable:

1. Open the terminal.

2. Open `~/.bash_profile` with a text editor. You can use nano for this:

   ```
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```

3. Add the following line at the end of the file:

   ```
   export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
   ```

   Replace `{USERNAME}` with your actual username.

4. Save the changes and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm the save, and finally `Enter` to confirm the file name.

5. Now, you need to source `~/.bash_profile` so that the changes take effect in the current terminal:

   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

6. You can now check if the environment variable is set correctly:

   ```
   echo $JBOSS_HOME
   ```

   This should output `/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7`.

If you still face the issue, you can add the `export` line to `~/.bashrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.profile`. The `~/.bashrc` file is sourced every time you open a new terminal, so this should definitely work.

If you're using a shell other than bash, like zsh for example (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you should add the `export` line to `~/.zshrc` instead.
