In SwiftUI, you can't directly initialize a `@Binding` variable. `@Binding` is used to create a two-way connection between a variable that's stored somewhere else.

However, in your preview, you can use the `.constant()` function to create a binding to a constant value. This is useful in previews and other places where you don’t have a mutable value to bind to.

Here is how you can do it:

```swift
#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In this case, `.constant(false)` creates a binding to the constant value `false`. This is useful in previews and other places where you don’t have a mutable value to bind to.
