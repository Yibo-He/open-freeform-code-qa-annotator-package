The error message you're seeing indicates that the `/data` directory is on a filesystem that has been mounted as read-only. This means you can't make changes to it, including creating new directories.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the filesystem's mount options.** You can do this by running the `mount` command with no arguments, which will list all mounted filesystems and their options. Look for the `/data` directory in this list and see if it's been mounted with the `ro` (read-only) option.

2. **Try remounting the filesystem as read-write.** If the filesystem is currently mounted as read-only, you can try remounting it as read-write using the `mount` command with the `-o remount,rw` option. For example:

   ```
   sudo mount -o remount,rw /data
   ```

   Note that this may not work if the filesystem is read-only due to a hardware issue or filesystem corruption.

3. **Check for filesystem errors.** If the filesystem is read-only due to errors, you may be able to fix it using the `fsck` command. Be aware that this can potentially cause data loss, so you should only do this if you have a backup of any important data. The command to check and repair filesystem errors depends on the type of filesystem, but for an ext4 filesystem, you would use:

   ```
   sudo fsck.ext4 -f /dev/sdXY
   ```

   Replace `/dev/sdXY` with the actual device node of your filesystem (you can find this in the output of the `mount` command).

4. **Check if the filesystem is physically write-protected.** If you're using a physical device like an SD card or USB drive, it may have a write-protect switch that's been set to the "locked" position. If this is the case, you'll need to physically switch it back to the "unlocked" position before you can write to the device.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to provide more information about your system and the specific filesystem you're trying to write to.
