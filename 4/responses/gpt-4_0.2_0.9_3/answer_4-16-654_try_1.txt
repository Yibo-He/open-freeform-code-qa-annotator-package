You can add your SSH key to Git Bash by following these steps:

1. Open Git Bash.

2. If you haven't already, you should first ensure ssh-agent is running using the command:

   ```bash
   eval $(ssh-agent -s)
   ```
   This will start ssh-agent if it's not already running, and set up the necessary environment variables.

3. Now you can add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file.

   ```bash
   ssh-add 'D:/keys folder/id_rsa'
   ```
   Replace `id_rsa` with your private key file name.

4. Now your SSH key has been added to Git Bash and you should be able to use it to clone your repository.

Note: Make sure your private key is in OpenSSH format. If it's not, you can convert it using PuTTYgen: Load your private key -> Conversions -> Export OpenSSH key.
