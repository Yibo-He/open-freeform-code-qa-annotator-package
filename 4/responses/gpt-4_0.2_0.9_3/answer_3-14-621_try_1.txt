The error you're seeing is because you're trying to access a `@State` variable outside of the `body` property. `@State` variables are designed to be used within the SwiftUI view's `body` property, and SwiftUI doesn't allow them to be accessed elsewhere.

However, you can use a different property wrapper, `@StateObject`, to achieve your goal. `@StateObject` is designed to be initialized in the `init()` method and can be used to store complex data that will survive for the lifetime of your view.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```swift
class TextModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var fullText: String
    
    init(letter: String) {
        self.fullText = letter
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    
    @StateObject var textModel: TextModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _textModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: TextModel(letter: list[letter]!))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $textModel.fullText)
    }
}
```

In this code, `TextModel` is a class that conforms to `ObservableObject` and has a `@Published` property `fullText`. This property will automatically notify the view to update whenever it changes. We initialize `TextModel` with the desired letter in the `init()` method of `StateFromOutside` and store it in a `@StateObject` property. Then we bind `TextField` to `textModel.fullText` so that it displays and updates the text.
