The error message "zsh: permission denied: ./startup.sh" means that the script `startup.sh` does not have the necessary permissions to execute.

This usually happens when the file's permissions do not allow execution. In Unix-like operating systems, you need to have execute ('x') permission to run a script like `startup.sh`.

You can add execute permissions to the script by running the following command:

```
chmod +x startup.sh
```

This command changes the mode of the file to add (+) execute (x) permissions. After running this command, you should be able to start the script with `./startup.sh nginx:start`.
