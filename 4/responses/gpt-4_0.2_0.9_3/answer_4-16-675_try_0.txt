You can show the current branch name in your terminal prompt by modifying your bash prompt. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your bash profile file. This is typically located at `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. You can open it with a text editor like nano or vim. For example:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

This script adds a function `parse_git_branch` that fetches the current git branch and adds it to your bash prompt.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you used nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm saving changes, then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Apply the changes by sourcing your bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your terminal prompt should show the current git branch whenever you're in a git repository directory.

Please note that this will only work if you have git installed in your WSL environment. If you don't have it installed, you can install it with `sudo apt install git`.
