You can use the `Get-ChildItem` command with the `-Name` parameter to get only the names of the files and folders. Then, you can pipe the output to the `Out-File` command to write it to the `.gitignore` file. Here is a single-line command that does this:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Name | Out-File .gitignore
```

This command will write the names of all files and folders in the current directory to the `.gitignore` file. If you want to include files and folders from subdirectories, you can use the `-Recurse` parameter:

```powershell
Get-ChildItem -Name -Recurse | Out-File .gitignore
```

Please note that this will also include the path of the files and folders from subdirectories relative to the current directory.
