The error message you're seeing is likely due to trying to update an immutable field in a Kubernetes object. Once a Kubernetes object is created, some fields are immutable and cannot be changed. If you try to change these fields, you will get an error message like the one you're seeing.

In your case, it seems like you're trying to update the `args` field of a Kubernetes Job. This field is immutable once the Job has been created. If you need to change the `args` field, you will need to delete the existing Job and create a new one with the updated `args`.

However, the issue you're facing might be due to the way you're formatting your bash script in the `args` field. Kubernetes expects the `args` field to be a list of strings, not a single string containing a bash script. 

You can try to split your bash script into separate strings like this:

```yaml
args:
  - "/bin/bash"
  - "-c"
  - |
    /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
    CHILD_PID=$!
    (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill $CHILD_PID; echo "Killed $CHILD_PID as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
    wait $CHILD_PID
    if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```

This way, the bash script is passed as a single argument to the `/bin/bash -c` command, which should be able to execute it correctly.
