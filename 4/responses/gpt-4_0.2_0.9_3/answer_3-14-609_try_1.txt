The issue is with the placement of your `.navigationBarTitle` modifier. It should be applied to the `List` inside the `NavigationView`, not the `NavigationView` itself. 

Here is the corrected code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct LandmarkList : View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(landmarkData) { landmark in
                LandmarkRow(landmark: landmark)
            }
            .navigationBarTitle(Text("Landmarks"))
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LandmarkList_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LandmarkList()
    }
}
#endif
```

In SwiftUI, the order and placement of modifiers is important. The `.navigationBarTitle` modifier sets the title of the navigation bar when the view is presented by a navigation view. Therefore, it should be applied to the view that will be presented, which in this case is the `List`, not the `NavigationView` itself.
