It seems like your AWS CLI is configured to use `vi` as the default pager. The AWS CLI uses a pager to manage the output of its commands. By default, it uses the pager defined in the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable. If this variable is not set, it will use the pager defined in the `PAGER` environment variable. If neither of these variables are set, it will use `less` as the default pager.

You can disable the pager by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. You can do this in the current terminal session by running:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the above line to your shell's profile script. If you're using `zsh`, you can add it to the `.zshrc` file:

```bash
echo 'export AWS_PAGER=""' >> ~/.zshrc
```

Then, source the `.zshrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

After doing this, the output of the `aws` command should be printed directly to the terminal.
