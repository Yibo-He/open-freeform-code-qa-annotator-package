The variable expansion you're using should work correctly in GitLab CI/CD. However, the issue you're experiencing might be due to a couple of reasons:

1. The variables `CI_MERGE_REQUEST_SOURCE_BRANCH_NAME`, `CI_COMMIT_BRANCH`, and `CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH` might not be defined in your GitLab CI/CD environment. You should ensure that these variables are correctly defined and accessible in your pipeline.

2. There might be an issue with the GitLab version you're using. You're using GitLab Enterprise Edition 14.1.8-ee. There might be a bug in this version that's causing the issue. You could try updating to the latest version of GitLab and see if the issue persists.

3. The issue might be with the `bash` runner you're using. You could try using a different runner and see if the issue persists.

If none of these solutions work, you should consider reaching out to GitLab support for further assistance.
