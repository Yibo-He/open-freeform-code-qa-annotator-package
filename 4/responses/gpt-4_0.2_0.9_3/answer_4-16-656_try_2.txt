Yes, you can get the detailed description of a service using the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet. The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not provide a description of the service. 

Here is how you can do it:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get you the Name, DisplayName, and Description of all the services on your machine. 

If you want to get the description of a specific service, you can filter the output like this:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Where-Object { $_.Name -eq 'YourServiceName' } | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description
```

Just replace 'YourServiceName' with the name of the service you want to get the description for.
