The error message suggests that the Java version being used is not compatible with the Gradle version. Gradle 7.0.2 requires Java 11 or later to run. 

You can check your Java version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
java -version
```

If your Java version is less than 11, you need to update it. 

If you are using multiple versions of Java in your system, you can specify which one to use for your project in the `gradle.properties` file:

```properties
org.gradle.java.home=/path/to/your/jdk
```

Replace `/path/to/your/jdk` with the actual path to your JDK 11 or later.

If you are using the Gradle Wrapper, you can specify the Java version in the `build.gradle` file:

```groovy
sourceCompatibility = '11'
targetCompatibility = '11'
```

After updating the Java version, try running the test coverage report task again. If the problem persists, please provide more details about your project configuration.
