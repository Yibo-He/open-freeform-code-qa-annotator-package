The issue you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding PendingIntent mutability. In Android 12 and above, you must explicitly specify whether a PendingIntent is mutable or immutable when you create it.

The error message suggests that the MediaSessionCompat class is trying to create a PendingIntent without specifying the mutability flag, which is not allowed when targeting Android 12 and above.

The issue seems to be in the AndroidX Media library, specifically in the MediaSessionCompat class. As you've pointed out, the library tries to handle the new requirement by using a mutable PendingIntent, but it seems like it's not working as expected.

Unfortunately, as this issue is within the AndroidX library, you can't directly fix it in your code. However, you can try the following workaround:

1. Downgrade your `targetSdkVersion` to 30 in your `build.gradle` file. This will allow your app to bypass the new PendingIntent requirement in Android 12. However, this is only a temporary solution, as you'll eventually need to update your `targetSdkVersion` to meet Play Store requirements.

2. Keep an eye on the AndroidX Media library for updates. The Android team is likely aware of this issue and will probably fix it in a future update. You can check the issue tracker for updates: [Android Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues)

3. Report the issue to the Android team if it hasn't been reported yet. Providing them with detailed information about the issue will help them fix it faster.

Remember to update your library as soon as a fix is available and test your app thoroughly to ensure the fix works as expected.
