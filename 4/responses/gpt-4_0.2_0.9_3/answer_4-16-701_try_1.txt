You can check if a specified folder is in your PATH by splitting the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and then checking if your specified directory is in that array. Here is a PowerShell function that does this:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # Get the PATH environment variable and split it into an array of directories
    $pathArray = $env:Path -split ';'

    # Check if the specified directory is in the array
    if ($pathArray -contains $Path_to_directory) {
        # If it is, return true
        return $true
    } else {
        # If it isn't, return false
        return $false
    }
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```powershell
if (FolderIsInPATH("C:\Some\Directory")) {
    Write-Host "The directory is in the PATH"
} else {
    Write-Host "The directory is not in the PATH"
}
```

This will print "The directory is in the PATH" if "C:\Some\Directory" is in your PATH, and "The directory is not in the PATH" otherwise.
