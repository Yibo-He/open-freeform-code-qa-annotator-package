The issue you're experiencing might be due to a few reasons. Here are some suggestions that might help you solve the problem:

1. **Check the Selenium WebDriver version**: Make sure that the Selenium WebDriver version you're using is compatible with the version of the browser you're trying to automate. 

2. **Check the Selenium Basic version**: Ensure that the Selenium Basic version is compatible with your Excel version. You might need to upgrade or downgrade Selenium Basic.

3. **Check the Internet Explorer version**: The code you've provided is starting an Internet Explorer driver. Ensure that the version of Internet Explorer installed on your machine is compatible with the Selenium WebDriver version you're using. 

4. **Check the Internet Explorer settings**: Selenium requires certain settings to be enabled in Internet Explorer. Go to Internet Options > Security tab, and ensure that "Enable Protected Mode" is checked for all zones (Internet, Local intranet, Trusted sites, Restricted sites).

5. **Try using a different browser**: If none of the above solutions work, you might want to try automating a different browser. If you decide to use Chrome or Firefox, make sure to download the corresponding WebDriver and add its location to your system's PATH.

Here is an example of how you can start a Chrome driver:

```vba
Dim driver As New WebDriver

driver.Start "chrome"
driver.Window.Maximize
driver.Get "https://www.google.com/"
```

Remember to replace "chrome" with "firefox" if you want to use Firefox. 

6. **Check the references in VBA**: In VBA, go to Tools > References and make sure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's not in the list, you might need to browse for the Selenium Basic .dll file and add it manually.

7. **Reinstall Selenium Basic**: If all else fails, try uninstalling and reinstalling Selenium Basic. 

If none of these suggestions work, please provide the exact error message you're getting so I can provide a more specific solution.
