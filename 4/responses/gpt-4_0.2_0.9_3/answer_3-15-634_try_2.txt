The error you're experiencing is a known issue that was introduced by the November 12, 2019, updates for Office. It affects all versions of Microsoft Access. The issue specifically affects queries that have a WHERE clause.

Microsoft has released updates to fix this issue. Here are the updates you should install based on your version of Office:

- Office 2010: Description of the security update for Office 2010: December 10, 2019 (KB4484193)
- Office 2013: Description of the security update for Office 2013: December 10, 2019 (KB4484186)
- Office 2016: Description of the security update for Office 2016: December 10, 2019 (KB4484180)

You can find these updates on the Microsoft Update Catalog website or they may be available through Windows Update.

After installing the appropriate update, you should be able to run your queries without encountering the "Query ' ' is corrupt" error.

If for some reason you can't install these updates, a workaround is to change your queries to avoid the issue. Instead of using a WHERE clause directly in the Update statement, you can use a domain function, like DLookup. Here's how you can modify your query:

```
DoCmd.RunSQL "update users set uname= 'bob' where usercode=" & DLookup("usercode", "users", "usercode=1")
```

This workaround may not be practical if you have a large number of queries to change, so installing the update to fix the issue is the recommended solution.
