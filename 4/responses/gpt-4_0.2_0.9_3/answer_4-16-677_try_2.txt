The issue is that you are using single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, which means your variable is not being expanded to its value. 

You should use double quotes instead, which will allow for variable expansion. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `grep -wi` is used to ignore the case and match the whole words. The `wc -l` command is used to count the number of lines. The `grep` command inside `echo` is used to print the matching lines.
