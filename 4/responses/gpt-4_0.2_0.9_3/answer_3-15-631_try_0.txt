You can achieve this by simply replacing the space character with an empty string. You can use the `Replace` function in VBA to do this. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = ""
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this code, `Replace(strVal, " ", "")` will replace all spaces in `strVal` with an empty string.
