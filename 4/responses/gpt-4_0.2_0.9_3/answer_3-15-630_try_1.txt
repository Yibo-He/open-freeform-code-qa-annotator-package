Sure, I can provide methods in Excel, Python, and SQL as these are commonly used tools for data manipulation.

1. Excel:
   - You can use the "Text to Columns" feature in Excel. This feature splits the text in a cell based on a delimiter, in this case, a comma. The reason this method is preferred is because it's straightforward and doesn't require any coding knowledge. However, it's not ideal for large datasets.

2. Python:
   - You can use the pandas library in Python. The `str.split()` function can split the strings in a column based on a delimiter and `explode()` function can transform each element of a list-like to a row.
   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Assuming df is your DataFrame and 'The Data' is your column
   df['The Data'] = df['The Data'].str.split(',')
   df = df.explode('The Data')
   ```
   This method is preferred when dealing with large datasets or when you need to automate the data cleaning process. It's also preferred when the data cleaning task is complex and cannot be easily done in Excel.

3. SQL:
   - In SQL, you can use the STRING_SPLIT function. However, this function is available only in SQL Server 2016 and later versions.
   ```sql
   SELECT value
   FROM YourTable
   CROSS APPLY STRING_SPLIT([The Data], ',')
   ```
   This method is preferred when the data is stored in a SQL Server database. It's also preferred when you need to perform other SQL operations on the data.

Each method has its own advantages and is preferred in different scenarios. The best method to use depends on the specific requirements of your task.
