The error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" is a common error in Xcode and can be caused by a variety of issues. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your script**: The error message suggests that a script you're running in the "Build Phases" of your Xcode project is failing. Check any scripts you have there for errors.

2. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed and updated. You can do this by running `pod install` or `pod update` in your terminal.

3. **Check your certificates**: This error can sometimes be caused by issues with your certificates. Try refreshing your certificates in Xcode by going to Xcode > Preferences > Accounts, selecting your Apple ID, and clicking on "Download Manual Profiles".

4. **Clean and rebuild your project**: Try cleaning your project (Shift + Command + K) and then rebuilding it (Command + B).

5. **Check your code signing settings**: Make sure your code signing settings are correct. Go to your target's settings, select "Build Settings", and check the "Code Signing Identity" and "Provisioning Profile" settings.

6. **Update Xcode**: If none of the above solutions work, the problem might be with Xcode itself. Try updating to the latest version of Xcode.

7. **Check for spaces in the directory path**: Sometimes, having spaces in the directory path can cause this issue. If there are spaces, try removing them or enclosing the path in quotes.

8. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that the Podfile is correctly configured and that all the dependencies are correctly listed.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to provide more information or error messages to further diagnose the problem.
