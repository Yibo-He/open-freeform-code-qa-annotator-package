Yes, you can get the detailed description of a service using the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet. The `Get-Service` cmdlet does not provide the description of the service. Here is how you can get the description:

```powershell
Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_Service | Select-Object Name, DisplayName, Description | Out-GridView
```

This command will get all the services with their names, display names, and descriptions and output them in a grid view.
