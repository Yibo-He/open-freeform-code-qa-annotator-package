The error message you're seeing indicates that the `Az.Accounts` module is not installed on the agent running your pipeline. 

To fix this, you can add a task in your pipeline to install the `Az.Accounts` module before your PowerShell script runs. Here's an example of how you can do this:

```yaml
steps:
- task: PowerShell@2
  displayName: 'Install Az.Accounts'
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: 'Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser'

- task: PowerShell@2
  displayName: 'Run PowerShell Script'
  inputs:
    filePath: 'path\to\your\script.ps1'
```

This will install the `Az.Accounts` module on the agent before your script runs. 

Please note that `-AllowClobber` parameter is used to overwrite any commands that have the same names as those in the module you're installing. `-Force` parameter is used to force the installation without any prompts. `-Scope CurrentUser` installs the module only for the current user, which is necessary in environments where you don't have admin rights.

Also, keep in mind that installing modules can take some time, so this might increase the total time it takes for your pipeline to run. If the agent you're using is persistent, you might consider installing this module as part of the agent setup to save time on each pipeline run.
