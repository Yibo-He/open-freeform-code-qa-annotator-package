The error you're experiencing might be due to several reasons. Here are a few things you could try:

1. **Check the Selenium WebDriver version**: Ensure that you're using the latest version of Selenium WebDriver. If not, try updating it.

2. **Check the Internet Explorer Driver Server**: If you're using Internet Explorer, you need to download the Internet Explorer Driver Server. This is a separate component from Selenium WebDriver and needs to be installed and configured separately.

3. **Check the SeleniumBasic references**: In VBA, go to Tools > References and ensure that Selenium Type Library is checked. If it's not, scroll through the list to find it and check it.

4. **Check the browser version and corresponding WebDriver**: The WebDriver you're using should correspond to the version of the browser you're using. For example, if you're using Chrome, you should be using ChromeDriver. If you're using Edge, you should be using EdgeDriver. Also, the WebDriver version should be compatible with the browser version.

5. **Check the browser settings**: If you're using Internet Explorer, you need to set the Zoom level to 100% and also need to set the same Protected Mode setting for each zone.

6. **Try using a different browser**: If none of the above solutions work, try using a different browser. If you're currently using Internet Explorer, try using Chrome or Firefox instead.

If none of these suggestions work, please provide the exact error message you're receiving for more specific help.
