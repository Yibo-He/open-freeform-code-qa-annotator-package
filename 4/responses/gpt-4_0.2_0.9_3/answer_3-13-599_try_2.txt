Jetpack Compose does not currently have a built-in NumberPicker widget like the traditional Android View system. However, you can create a custom one using the existing composables. Here is a simple example of how you might create a NumberPicker in Jetpack Compose:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NumberPicker(
    range: IntRange,
    selectedValue: Int,
    onValueChange: (Int) -> Unit
) {
    val scrollState = rememberScrollState()

    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .verticalScroll(scrollState)
            .height(200.dp)
            .width(50.dp)
            .border(1.dp, Color.Black),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        range.forEach { number ->
            Text(
                text = number.toString(),
                modifier = Modifier
                    .fillMaxWidth()
                    .clickable { onValueChange(number) },
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                fontSize = if (number == selectedValue) 24.sp else 16.sp,
                color = if (number == selectedValue) Color.Red else Color.Black
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This is a very basic example and does not include fling or snap to position functionality. For a more advanced NumberPicker, you might need to use `LazyColumn` with `LazyListState` to control the scroll position and animate scroll.

Please note that Jetpack Compose is still under active development and the APIs can change. Always check the latest documentation for the most up-to-date information.
