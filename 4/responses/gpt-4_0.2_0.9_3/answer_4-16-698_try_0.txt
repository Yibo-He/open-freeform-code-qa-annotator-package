You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `source ~/.bash_profile` and press Enter.

This will apply any new changes you've made to your `.bash_profile` in your current terminal session. 

If you are using zsh (which is default in newer versions of macOS), the command would be `source ~/.zshrc`.
