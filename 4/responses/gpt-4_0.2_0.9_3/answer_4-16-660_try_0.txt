The error message indicates that the `Az.Accounts` module is not installed on the agent running the pipeline. You can install the module by adding a PowerShell task before the task that runs your script. 

Here is an example of how to do it:

```yaml
steps:
- powershell: |
    if (!(Get-Module -ListAvailable -Name Az.Accounts)) {
        Install-Module -Name Az.Accounts -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser
    }
  displayName: 'Install Az.Accounts module'

- powershell: |
    # Your script here
  displayName: 'Run script'
```

This script checks if the `Az.Accounts` module is available, and if it's not, it installs it. The `-Force` parameter is used to reinstall the module if it's already installed, `-AllowClobber` parameter allows you to install functions that have the same names as existing functions in your session, and `-Scope CurrentUser` installs the module only for the current user, which doesn't require admin rights.

Please note that this will install the module every time the pipeline runs, which might slow down the pipeline. If you have control over the agent, you might want to install the module manually once, or create a startup script that installs the module, so it's available for all pipelines.
