This issue can occur due to various reasons such as corruption in the workbook, issues with Excel, or problems with the VBA project. Here are some steps you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Recompile the VBA project**: Go to the VBA editor (Alt + F11), then Debug > Compile VBAProject. If there are any issues with the code, this should highlight them.

2. **Save the workbook as .xlsb**: Sometimes, saving the workbook as .xlsb (Excel Binary Workbook) and then reopening it can resolve the issue.

3. **Export and Import Modules**: Try to export the modules, then delete them from the project, and import them again. This can sometimes fix issues with the VBA project.

4. **Repair Excel**: If the issue persists, it might be a problem with Excel itself. You can try to repair your Office installation (Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Microsoft Office > Change > Repair).

5. **Use a Previous Version**: If you have a backup or a previous version of the workbook, try using that.

6. **Use a VBA Code Recovery Tool**: There are tools available online that can help recover VBA code from corrupted workbooks. You can try using one of these if none of the above solutions work.

Remember to always keep a backup of your workbooks to prevent data loss.
