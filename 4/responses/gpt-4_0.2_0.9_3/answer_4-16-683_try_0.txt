The colors in your terminal are not determined by iTerm2 itself, but by the shell that you are using. In your case, it looks like you are using bash. The prompt is controlled by the PS1 environment variable. You can change the color of the prompt by modifying this variable.

Here's a basic example of how you can change the color of your username, hostname, and path:

1. Open your bash profile in a text editor. This is typically located at `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc`. You can open this in a text editor from the terminal like this:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   nano ~/.bashrc
   ```

2. Add the following lines to the file:

   ```bash
   export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
   ```

   This will set your username and hostname to green (`\[\033[01;32m\]`), and your path to blue (`\[\033[01;34m\]`). The `\[\033[00m\]` resets the color back to the default.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm that you want to save the changes, and then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Restart your terminal or source your bash profile for the changes to take effect:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   or

   ```bash
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

You can customize the colors by changing the color codes. The format is `\[\033[style;fg;bgm\]`, where `style` is 0 for normal, 1 for bold, `fg` is the foreground color, and `bg` is the background color. The color codes are 30 for black, 31 for red, 32 for green, 33 for yellow, 34 for blue, 35 for magenta, 36 for cyan, and 37 for white.

For example, if you wanted your username and hostname to be bold and red, and your path to be bold and cyan, you could use:

```bash
export PS1='\[\033[01;31m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;36m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
```
