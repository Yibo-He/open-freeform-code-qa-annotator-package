You can use the `git` command to show the current branch name in your terminal.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal in VSCode.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

This command will output the name of the current branch that HEAD is pointing to.

If you want to show the current branch name in your terminal prompt like Bash, you can add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
 git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}

export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

Then, source your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, your terminal prompt will display the current branch name.

Please note that you need to have `git` installed in your WSL for these commands to work.
