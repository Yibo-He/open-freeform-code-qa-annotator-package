The `setx` command overwrites the existing value of the PATH variable. If you want to append a new path to the existing PATH variable, you should include `%PATH%` in your command. Here's how you can do it:

```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m
```

This command will append the new path to the existing PATH variable instead of overwriting it.

However, there's a limitation with `setx` command. It can only handle values up to 1024 characters long. If your PATH variable is longer than that, it will be truncated and you might lose some paths.

A safer way to modify your PATH variable is to do it through the System Properties window:

1. Right-click on Computer on the desktop or in Start Menu.
2. Choose "Properties".
3. Click on "Advanced system settings".
4. In the System Properties window that appears, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
5. In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables", scroll down until you find the "Path" variable, then click on it to highlight it.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. In the Edit Environment Variable window that appears, you can add new paths by typing them into the "Variable value" box, each one separated by a semicolon (;). Be careful not to make any other changes.
8. Click "OK" in each window to close them.

Remember to restart your command prompt or any other applications that use the PATH variable to make sure they pick up the new value.
