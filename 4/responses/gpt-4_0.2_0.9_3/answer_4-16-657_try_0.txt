In PowerShell, there isn't a built-in way to output bold text in the console. However, you can change the color of the text to make it stand out, which can be done using the `-ForegroundColor` parameter of the `Write-Host` cmdlet.

Here is an example:

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a message" -ForegroundColor Green
```

In this example, the text "This is a message" will be displayed in green color.

You can choose from various colors like Black, DarkBlue, DarkGreen, DarkCyan, DarkRed, DarkMagenta, DarkYellow, Gray, DarkGray, Blue, Green, Cyan, Red, Magenta, Yellow, and White.

If you want to make the output more noticeable, you could also consider using `Write-Warning` or `Write-Error` cmdlets, which will display the message in yellow and red respectively.

```powershell
Write-Warning "This is a warning message"
Write-Error "This is an error message"
```

Remember that using `Write-Error` will also add an error to the error stream, which might not be what you want if it's not an actual error.

If you are writing a script that will be used in a GUI or a web page, then you could use HTML tags to make the text bold. But in a console or terminal, your options for text formatting are limited.
