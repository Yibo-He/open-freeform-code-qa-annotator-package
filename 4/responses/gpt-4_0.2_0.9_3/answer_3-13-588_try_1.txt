The error you're seeing is a known issue with the Kotlin plugin in Android Studio. It's not related to your code or the way you're using Safe Args. 

Here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild the project:** Go to `Build > Clean Project` then `Build > Rebuild Project`.

2. **Invalidate Caches and Restart:** Go to `File > Invalidate Caches / Restart... > Invalidate and Restart`.

3. **Update Kotlin Plugin:** Make sure you're using the latest version of the Kotlin plugin in Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Android Studio > Check for Updates...` on macOS or `Help > Check for Updates...` on Windows.

4. **Update Android Studio:** Make sure you're using the latest version of Android Studio. You can check for updates by going to `Android Studio > Check for Updates...` on macOS or `Help > Check for Updates...` on Windows.

5. **Delete the `.idea` folder:** Close Android Studio, delete the `.idea` folder in your project directory, and then reopen Android Studio. This will force Android Studio to recreate the project metadata.

If none of these solutions work, you might want to consider filing a bug report with JetBrains, the creators of Kotlin.
