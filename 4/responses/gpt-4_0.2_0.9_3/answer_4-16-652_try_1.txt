The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output by default. This is why you are seeing the interactive pager for each command. You can disable this behavior by setting the AWS_PAGER environment variable to an empty string.

You can do this in your script like this:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  AWS_PAGER="" aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

Or you can set it once in your shell session before running the script:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
```

Then run your script:

```bash
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will prevent the AWS CLI from using a pager for its output.
