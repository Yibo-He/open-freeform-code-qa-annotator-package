The error message you're seeing is related to Git, not Homebrew or GLEW. It seems like Git is having trouble cloning the repository from GitHub.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure you have a stable internet connection. If your internet connection is unstable, it might cause the remote server to hang up.

2. **Increase Git's HTTP buffer**: Git has an internal buffer for HTTP requests, and if the repository you're trying to clone is too large, it might cause issues. You can increase the buffer size with the following command:

    ```
    git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
    ```

    This will increase the buffer size to 500 MB.

3. **Change the Git protocol**: If you're cloning the repository via HTTPS, you can try switching to SSH, or vice versa. You can change the protocol in the repository URL. For example, if the current URL is `https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask`, you can change it to `git@github.com:Homebrew/homebrew-cask.git` to use SSH.

4. **Check if GitHub is down**: It's also possible that GitHub is having issues. You can check the status of GitHub at https://www.githubstatus.com/.

5. **Try to clone the repository manually**: You can try to clone the repository manually to see if you get the same error. Use the following command:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask
    ```

    If you can clone the repository manually, then the issue might be with Homebrew. If you get the same error, then the issue is likely with Git or your internet connection.

6. **Reinstall Git**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try reinstalling Git. Uninstall it first with the following command:

    ```
    brew uninstall git
    ```

    Then reinstall it with:

    ```
    brew install git
    ```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
