The error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" is a generic error message that Xcode gives when any script phase fails. The actual error could be anything that causes the script to return a non-zero exit code.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check your build phases:** Go to your target's build phases and check if there are any scripts that are causing the issue. If there are any custom scripts, make sure they are working as expected.

2. **Check your dependencies:** Since you are using CocoaPods, make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed. Try running `pod deintegrate` and `pod install` again.

3. **Check your code signing settings:** Sometimes this error can be caused by incorrect code signing settings. Make sure you have the correct provisioning profile selected and that your certificate is valid.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project:** Try cleaning your project (Shift + Command + K) and rebuilding it (Command + B).

5. **Update Xcode:** If none of the above solutions work, it could be an issue with Xcode itself. Try updating Xcode to the latest version.

6. **Check the error details:** The error message should have more details about what exactly failed. Check the error details to get more information about what is causing the issue.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about the error so I can give a more specific solution.
