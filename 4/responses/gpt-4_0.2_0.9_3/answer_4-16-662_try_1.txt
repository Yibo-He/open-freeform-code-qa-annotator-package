You can use the `jq` command-line tool to minify JSON in bash. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not already installed, you can install it with the package manager for your system. For example, on Ubuntu you would use `sudo apt-get install jq`.

Here's how you can use `jq` to minify your JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

The `-c` option stands for "compact output". It will remove all the unnecessary white space.

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can then use this output as input to another command. For example:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c . | http POST httpbin.org/post
```

This will send a POST request to httpbin.org with your minified JSON as the body.
