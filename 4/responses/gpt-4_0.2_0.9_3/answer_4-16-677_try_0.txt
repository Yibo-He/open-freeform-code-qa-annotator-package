The issue is with the single quotes around the variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning your variable isn't being expanded. You should use double quotes instead.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly substitute the value of the variable `$searchT` into the `grep` command. If matches are found in `test.txt`, it will print the number of matches and the matching lines. If no matches are found, it will print "no match found".
