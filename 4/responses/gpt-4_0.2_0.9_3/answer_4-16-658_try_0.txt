It seems like you're having trouble with Docker on Windows Server 2019. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Docker Version**: Ensure that you have the correct version of Docker installed. Docker Desktop is not supported on Windows Server. You should be using Docker Enterprise Edition for Windows Server 2019.

2. **Reinstall Docker**: If you have the wrong version of Docker installed, you will need to uninstall it and then reinstall the correct version. Here are the steps to do that:

   - Uninstall Docker:
     ```
     Uninstall-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
     ```
   - Install Docker:
     ```
     Install-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
     ```
   - Restart the Docker service:
     ```
     Restart-Service Docker
     ```

3. **Check Docker Service**: Ensure that the Docker service is running. You can check this by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```
   Get-Service Docker
   ```
   If the Docker service is not running, you can start it with the following command:
   ```
   Start-Service Docker
   ```

4. **Check Docker Configuration**: Ensure that Docker is configured to run in process isolation mode. You can check this by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```
   docker info
   ```
   Look for the "Isolation" line in the output. If it's not set to "process", you can set it by modifying the Docker configuration file.

5. **Check Docker Images**: Ensure that you are using Windows-based Docker images. Linux-based images will not work with process isolation on Windows Server.

If you're still having trouble after trying these steps, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error messages you're seeing.
