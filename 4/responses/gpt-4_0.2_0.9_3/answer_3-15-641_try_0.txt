Based on your description, it seems like you're trying to automate the process of creating folders and files on SharePoint using VBA and also trying to retrieve the local path of the SharePoint file.

Unfortunately, VBA doesn't support creating folders or files on SharePoint directly. However, you can use the SharePoint REST API to create folders and files. You can call the REST API from VBA using the `MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP` object. Here is an example of how to create a folder using the SharePoint REST API:

```vba
Sub CreateFolder()

    Dim objXMLHTTP As Object
    Set objXMLHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP.6.0")

    Dim strURL As String
    strURL = "https://<your-sharepoint-site>/_api/web/folders"

    objXMLHTTP.Open "POST", strURL, False
    objXMLHTTP.setRequestHeader "Content-Type", "application/json;odata=verbose"
    objXMLHTTP.setRequestHeader "Accept", "application/json;odata=verbose"
    objXMLHTTP.setRequestHeader "X-RequestDigest", "<your-form-digest-value>"

    Dim strBody As String
    strBody = "{ '__metadata': { 'type': 'SP.Folder' }, 'ServerRelativeUrl': '/Shared Documents/<your-folder-name>' }"

    objXMLHTTP.send strBody

End Sub
```
Please replace `<your-sharepoint-site>`, `<your-form-digest-value>`, and `<your-folder-name>` with your actual SharePoint site URL, form digest value, and folder name respectively.

To retrieve the local path of the SharePoint file, you can use the `ActiveWorkbook.Path` property in VBA. This property returns the complete, saved path to the workbook file, including the name of the workbook. If the workbook has never been saved, this property returns an empty string.

```vba
Sub GetLocalPath()

    Dim strPath As String
    strPath = ActiveWorkbook.Path

    MsgBox strPath

End Sub
```
Please note that the `ActiveWorkbook.Path` property will return the SharePoint URL if the workbook is opened from SharePoint. If you want to get the local path of the synced SharePoint folder, you may need to parse the SharePoint URL and replace it with the local path manually.

I hope this helps! If you have any further questions, please let me know.
