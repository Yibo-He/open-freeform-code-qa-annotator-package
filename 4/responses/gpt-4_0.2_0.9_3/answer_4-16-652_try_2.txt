The AWS CLI uses a pager program to handle its output. By default, it uses the `less` program. This is why you're seeing an interactive pager for each command.

You can disable this behavior by setting the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string. This will prevent AWS CLI from using a pager for its output.

You can do this in your bash script like this:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo; 
done
```

This will set the `AWS_PAGER` environment variable to an empty string for the duration of the script, effectively disabling the pager.

If you want to disable the pager permanently, you can add the `export AWS_PAGER=""` line to your shell's profile file (like `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` for bash). Then, every new shell session will have this variable set.

If you want to redirect the output to a file, you can do so using the `>` operator:

```bash
export AWS_PAGER=""
for x in 1 2 3; do 
  aws sqs purge-queue --queue-url https://sqs.<aws-region>.amazonaws.com/<id>/<env>-$x-<queueName>.fifo > output.txt; 
done
```

This will write the output of each command to the file `output.txt`. If you want to append the output to the file instead of overwriting it each time, you can use the `>>` operator instead of `>`.
