The script you provided is not correct. Here is a corrected version using the `date` command in bash:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    date=$(echo $line | awk -F"T" '{ print $1 }')
    formatted_date=$(date -d"$date" +"%d %b %Y")
    echo $formatted_date
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line from the file `filename.txt`. For each line, it splits the line at the "T" character to get the date part. Then it uses the `date` command to convert the date to the desired format.

Please replace `filename.txt` with your actual file path.

This script assumes that the date command on your system supports the `-d` option for specifying a date string. If it doesn't, you may need to use a different method to parse the date.
