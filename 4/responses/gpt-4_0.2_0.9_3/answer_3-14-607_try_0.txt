You can simplify your code by using a ternary operator to change the color of the image based on the `chatMessageIsValid` condition. This way, you won't need to duplicate your code and it won't kick you out of the text field after typing one character.

Here's how you can do it:

```swift
Spacer()
HStack {
    TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
        .padding(.leading, 10)
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    Button(action: sendMessage) {
        Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
            .foregroundColor(chatMessageIsValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
            .padding(.trailing, 10)
    }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
}
```

In this code, the color of the image will be blue if `chatMessageIsValid` is true, otherwise it will be gray. The button will be disabled if `chatMessageIsValid` is false.
