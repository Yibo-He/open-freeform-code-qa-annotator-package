This issue can be caused by a variety of reasons, but here are some possible solutions that you can try:

1. Clean Build Folder: In Xcode, go to "Product" -> "Clean Build Folder". This will clean up any old build files that might be causing the issue.

2. Delete Derived Data: Go to "Preferences" -> "Locations" -> "Derived Data". Delete the derived data for your project. This will force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

3. Update Swift Version: Check if your Pods are compatible with the Swift version you're using. You might need to update the Swift version in your Podfile or in the build settings of your Pods.

4. Check for Swift Compiler - Language settings: Go to "Build Settings" -> "Swift Compiler - Language" and check if the "Swift Language Version" is correct. If not, change it to the correct version.

5. Reinstall Pods: Try deleting the Podfile.lock file and the Pods folder, then run `pod install` again.

6. Check for Errors in Your Code: Sometimes, the error might be in your code. Check if there are any syntax errors, especially in the files mentioned in the error message.

7. Update Xcode: Sometimes, updating Xcode to the latest version can solve the issue. Go to the App Store and check if there are any updates available for Xcode.

Remember to always backup your project before making any changes. If none of these solutions work, you might need to consider downgrading Xcode to a previous version that worked with your project.
