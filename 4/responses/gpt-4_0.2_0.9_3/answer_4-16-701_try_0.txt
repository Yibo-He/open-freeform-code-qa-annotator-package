You can achieve this by splitting the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and then checking if your specified directory is in that array. Here is a function that does exactly that:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # Get the PATH environment variable and split it into an array of directories
    $PATH_directories = $env:PATH -split ';'

    # Check if the specified directory is in the array
    if ($PATH_directories -contains $Path_to_directory) {
        return $true
    } else {
        return $false
    }
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```powershell
if (FolderIsInPATH("C:\Windows\System32")) {
    Write-Host "The directory is in PATH"
} else {
    Write-Host "The directory is not in PATH"
}
```

This will print "The directory is in PATH" if "C:\Windows\System32" is in your PATH, and "The directory is not in PATH" otherwise.
