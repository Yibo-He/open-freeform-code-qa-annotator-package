The code you provided is trying to create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet using the Power Query connection string. However, it seems like there are some issues with the code.

Firstly, you're trying to get the query name from a cell value in Sheet6. This is not how you should reference a Power Query. Power Queries are stored in the WorkbookQuery collection of the workbook, not in cells. You should reference them by their name directly.

Secondly, you're trying to use the query name as part of the connection string and the SQL command text. This is not correct. The connection string should reference the workbook and the query name, but the SQL command text should just be a SQL query that the Power Query can execute.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable

    ' Get the query by its name
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("YourQueryName") ' replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your query

    ' Get the current sheet and the target sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("target")

    ' Delete existing query table if any
    If targetSheet.ListObjects.Count > 0 Then
        targetSheet.ListObjects(1).Delete
    End If

    ' Create a new QueryTable in the target sheet
    Set qt = targetSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=targetSheet.Range("$A$1")).QueryTable

    With qt
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a Power Query named "YourQueryName" in your workbook. Replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your query. The code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet using the Power Query as the data source.

Please note that Power Query and VBA are not fully integrated, and there are some limitations to what you can do with Power Query from VBA. For example, you can't modify the Power Query itself from VBA, you can only refresh it and load its results into a table.
