A NuGet provider for PowerShell is not just the `nuget.exe`. It's a specific package that allows PowerShell to interact with NuGet-based repositories. It's a plugin for PowerShell's PackageManagement module, which allows PowerShell to understand how to use NuGet repositories.

Since your computer is not connected to the internet, you need to manually download the NuGet provider on a machine that has internet access and then transfer it to your offline machine. Here are the steps:

1. On a machine with internet access, open PowerShell and run the following command to download the NuGet provider:

```powershell
Save-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -Path <Path to save the provider> -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force
```

Replace `<Path to save the provider>` with the path where you want to save the NuGet provider. This command will download a `.nupkg` file.

2. Transfer the `.nupkg` file to your offline machine.

3. On your offline machine, open PowerShell and run the following command to install the NuGet provider:

```powershell
Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force
```

4. Then, you can install your `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` package using the `Install-Package` command:

```powershell
Install-Package -Name pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg -Source {path to pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg}
```

Replace `{path to pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg}` with the actual path where you have the `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` file.

Please note that the `Install-Package` command is used instead of `Install-Module` because you're installing a `.nupkg` file, which is a NuGet package, not a PowerShell module.
