Based on your code and the sample input and output you provided, it seems like you want to split the line that contains the values for "Cabinet No.", "Subrack No.", "Slot No.", "TX Channel No.", and "VSWR(0.01)" into separate columns in Excel.

To do this, you can use the `Split` function in VBA, which splits a string into a one-dimensional array based on a delimiter. In your case, the delimiter is a space (" ").

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim parts() As String
    parts = Split(textline, " ") 'split the line into parts
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = parts(0) 'Cabinet No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = parts(1) 'Subrack No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = parts(2) 'Slot No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = parts(3) 'TX Channel No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = parts(4) 'VSWR(0.01)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that each value is separated by a single space. If there are multiple spaces, you might need to add some additional logic to handle that.

Please note that this is a simple solution and may not work perfectly if your data is not consistently formatted. For example, if one of the values contains a space, it will be split into two parts. If this is the case, you may need a more complex solution, such as using a regular expression to match the values.
