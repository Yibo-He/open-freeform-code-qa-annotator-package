The behavior you're seeing is due to Docker's build output changes in recent versions. Docker now uses a new build output format called BuildKit by default, which is more efficient and concise but does not show the full output of each command by default.

To get the full output, you can disable BuildKit by setting the environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` before running your build command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
docker build .
```

This will revert to the old build output format and should show the full output of each command.

Alternatively, if you want to keep using BuildKit but see the full output of specific commands, you can use the `RUN` instruction with a `||` (OR) operator to ensure the command's output is shown even if the command is successful. Here's an example:

```Dockerfile
RUN ls -la || true
```

This will run `ls -la`, and then run `true` regardless of whether `ls -la` succeeded or failed. Since `true` is a command that always succeeds, the `RUN` instruction will always succeed. But because `ls -la` might fail, Docker will show its output to help you debug the potential error.
