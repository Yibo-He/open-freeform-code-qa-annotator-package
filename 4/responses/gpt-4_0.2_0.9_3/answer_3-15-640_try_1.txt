This issue might be due to corruption in your Excel workbook. Here are some steps you can try to recover your VBA modules:

1. **Try to Open and Repair the Workbook**: Open Excel, go to File > Open, navigate to your workbook, but don't open it yet. Instead, click on the arrow next to the Open button, and select Open and Repair.

2. **Save the Workbook in a Different Format**: Open the workbook, then go to File > Save As, and choose a different format like Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb) or Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls). After saving, close the workbook and reopen it in the new format.

3. **Import the Modules into a New Workbook**: If you can still see the modules in the VBA editor, try to export them (right-click on the module > Export File). Then, create a new workbook and import the modules (right-click in the Project Explorer of the VBA editor > Import File).

4. **Use a VBA Code to Export the Modules**: If you can't manually export the modules, you can use a VBA code to do it. Here's an example:

    ```vba
    Sub ExportAllCode()
        Dim wb As Workbook
        Dim obj As Object
        Dim i As Integer

        Set wb = ThisWorkbook
        i = 1

        With wb.VBProject
            For Each obj In .VBComponents
                Select Case obj.Type
                    Case vbext_ct_ClassModule, vbext_ct_MSForm, vbext_ct_StdModule
                        obj.Export "C:\YourPath\" & obj.Name & i & ".cls"
                        i = i + 1
                End Select
            Next obj
        End With
    End Sub
    ```
    This code will export all your modules, class modules and userforms into .cls files. You can then import these files into a new workbook.

5. **Use a Third-Party Tool**: If none of the above methods work, you might need to use a third-party tool to recover your workbook. There are several tools available online, both free and paid.

Remember to always keep a backup of your workbooks to prevent data loss.
