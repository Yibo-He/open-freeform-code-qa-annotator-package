The error you're encountering is due to the fact that pdftk is not compatible with MacOS Catalina. Catalina only supports 64-bit applications, and pdftk is a 32-bit application. 

However, you can use a tool called PDFtk Server, which is a command-line tool that is a part of the PDFtk toolkit. It is compatible with MacOS Catalina.

Here are the steps to install PDFtk Server on MacOS Catalina:

1. Install Homebrew if you haven't already. You can install it by pasting the following command in your terminal:
   
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Once Homebrew is installed, you can install PDFtk Server by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   brew install pdftk-java
   ```

3. After the installation, you can use the `pdftk-java` command in place of `pdftk`.

Please note that `pdftk-java` is a version of PDFtk ported to Java. It supports the same functionality as `pdftk` but requires Java to be installed on your machine.
