You can achieve this by using a programming language. Here's how you can do it in Python:

For converting to camelCase:

```python
def to_camel_case(text):
    words = text.split('-')
    return words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])

var1 = "my-name-is"
print(to_camel_case(var1))  # Output: "myNameIs"
```

For converting to PascalCase:

```python
def to_pascal_case(text):
    words = text.split('_')
    return ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)

var2 = "my_Name_is"
print(to_pascal_case(var2))  # Output: "MyNameIs"
```

In the first function `to_camel_case`, we split the text by `-` and then capitalize each word except the first one. In the second function `to_pascal_case`, we split the text by `_` and then capitalize each word.
