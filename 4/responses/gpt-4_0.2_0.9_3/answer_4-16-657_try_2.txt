In PowerShell, you can't directly make the output text bold. However, you can change the color of the output text using the "Write-Host" cmdlet, which can help to distinguish different parts of your output.

Here's an example:

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a normal text"
Write-Host "This is a green text" -ForegroundColor Green
```

In this example, the first line will output normal text, and the second line will output green text.

If you want to make your output more noticeable, you can use a combination of different colors for different parts of your output.

Also, if you are writing scripts that are intended to be used by other people, it's generally recommended to use "Write-Output" or "Write-Verbose" instead of "Write-Host". The "Write-Host" cmdlet is primarily intended for interactive use, and its output can't be captured or redirected, which can be a problem if your script is being used in a pipeline or automated process.
