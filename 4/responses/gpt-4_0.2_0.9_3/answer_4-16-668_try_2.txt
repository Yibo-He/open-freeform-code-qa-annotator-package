You can use the `-i` option with `grep` to make your search case insensitive. Here's how you can modify your command:

```bash
cat file1 | grep -i "success\.\.\."
```

This command will return lines containing either `Success...` or `success...`.

Also, you can use `grep` directly on the file without using `cat`:

```bash
grep -i "success\.\.\." file1
```
