The error message you're seeing is related to Git and not specifically to Homebrew or GLEW. It seems like the Git clone operation is failing due to some network issues. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your internet connection**: Make sure your internet connection is stable and try again.

2. **Increase Git's HTTP buffer**: Git has a setting that allows you to increase the HTTP buffer which can help with this kind of issue. You can increase it by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```
   git config --global http.postBuffer 524288000
   ```

   This command sets the size of the buffer used by Git when sending data over HTTP to 500 MB, which should be more than enough for most repositories.

3. **Change the Git clone URL**: Sometimes, changing the URL from `https` to `git` can help. You can do this by editing the formula directly. Use `brew edit glew` to open the formula in a text editor, then change the `url` line from `https://...` to `git://...`. Save the file and try to install again.

4. **Try to clone the repository manually**: You can try to clone the repository manually to see if the problem persists. Run the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-cask
   ```

   If this command fails too, then the problem is likely with your Git setup or network connection.

5. **Check if you are behind a firewall or VPN**: If you are behind a firewall or using a VPN, it might be blocking your connection. Try disabling it temporarily and see if the problem persists.

Remember to run `brew update` and `brew doctor` after each step to make sure everything is up to date and working correctly.
