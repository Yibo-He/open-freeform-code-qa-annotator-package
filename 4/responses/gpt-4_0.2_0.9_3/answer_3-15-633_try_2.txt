Unfortunately, the `FILTER` function is a dynamic array function that is only available in Office 365 and Office 2019. However, you can achieve the same result using a combination of `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in Office Pro Plus 2019.

Here is the formula you can use:

```
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROWS($A$1:A1))), "")
```

This formula should be entered as an array formula. After typing the formula, instead of pressing Enter, press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Excel will surround the formula with curly braces `{}` to indicate it's an array formula.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x". The `SMALL` function then returns the smallest row number on the first row, the second smallest on the second row, and so on. The `INDEX` function then returns the value from column B for each of these row numbers.

If you have a large dataset and you want to use a VBA macro instead, here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim outputRow As Long

    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    outputRow = 1

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2").Cells(outputRow, "A").Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            outputRow = outputRow + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro will copy all values from column B to Sheet2 where the corresponding value in column A is "x". You can adjust the range and sheets as needed.
