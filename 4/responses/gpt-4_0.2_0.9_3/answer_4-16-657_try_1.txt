In PowerShell, you can't directly output bold text using the "Write-Host" cmdlet. However, you can use colors to differentiate the output and make it more readable. Here is an example:

```powershell
Write-Host "This is a message" -ForegroundColor Green
```

In this example, the text "This is a message" will be printed in green color.

If you are writing scripts for a web-based environment or a tool that supports HTML, you could use HTML tags to make text bold. But this won't work in a standard PowerShell console.

If you are using PowerShell 7.1 or later, you can use ANSI escape sequences to make text bold, but this will only work in some terminals that support it.

```powershell
Write-Host "`e[1mThis is a bold message`e[0m"
```

In this example, "`e[1m" is the ANSI escape sequence for bold text, and "`e[0m" resets it. Please note that this might not work in all terminals.

Remember that "Write-Host" is generally not recommended for most scripts because it interferes with the pipeline and it's not possible to suppress or capture its output. Consider using "Write-Output" or "Write-Verbose" instead.
