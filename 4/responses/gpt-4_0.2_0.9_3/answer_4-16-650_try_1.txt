No problem at all, I'm here to help! Here's how you can do it in PowerShell:

First, you can read the file and store each line in an array using the `Get-Content` cmdlet:

```powershell
$arrayFromFile = Get-Content -Path "C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt"
```

Then, you can iterate over each element in the array and run your command:

```powershell
foreach($x in $arrayFromFile)
{
    newman run $x
}
```

So, your complete script would look like this:

```powershell
$arrayFromFile = Get-Content -Path "C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt"

foreach($x in $arrayFromFile)
{
    newman run $x
}
```

This script reads the file `collection.txt`, stores each line in the array `$arrayFromFile`, and then runs the `newman run` command for each element in the array.
