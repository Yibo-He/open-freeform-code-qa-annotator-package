The `*.plain.jar` file is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0 and later versions. This task is automatically added by the Spring Boot plugin. The `*.plain.jar` is a jar file that contains only your project's classes and resources, without any of the dependencies.

If you want to disable the generation of the `*.plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file to not generate it. You can do this by setting the `enabled` property of the `bootJar` task to `false`.

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}
```

Add this to your `build.gradle` file. This will disable the `bootJar` task, and as a result, the `*.plain.jar` file will not be generated.

However, please note that this will also disable the generation of the `*.jar` file that contains your project's classes, resources, and dependencies. If you still want to generate this file, you should use the `jar` task instead:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = false
}

jar {
    enabled = true
}
```

This will disable the `bootJar` task (and thus the generation of the `*.plain.jar` file), but enable the `jar` task (and thus the generation of the `*.jar` file that contains your project's classes, resources, and dependencies).
