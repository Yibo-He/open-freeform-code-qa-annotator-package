The issue you're experiencing is quite strange and not a common one. The Kotlin `random()` function should be working as expected. However, since it's not, you can try using the Java `Random` class in your Kotlin code as a workaround. 

Here's how you can modify your `getNextChoice()` and `getNextImage()` functions to use Java's `Random`:

```kotlin
import java.util.Random

private fun getNextChoice(): Int {
    val random = Random()
    return random.nextInt(2) // 0..1
}

private fun getNextImage(imageList: Array<Image>): Int {
    val random = Random()
    val listSize = imageList.size
    var imageId: Int
    do {
        imageId = random.nextInt(listSize) // 0 until listSize
    } while (imageList[imageId].played)

    imageList[imageId].played = true
    return imageList[imageId].image
}
```

This should give you different random numbers each time you run your app, just like it does in your Java test app. 

If you still face the issue, it might be related to the specific device or Android version you're using. In that case, you might want to report it to the Kotlin team.
