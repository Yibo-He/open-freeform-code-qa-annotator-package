You can use the `jq` command-line tool to minify JSON in a bash console. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using a package manager like `apt` for Ubuntu, `brew` for MacOS, etc.

Here is how you can use `jq` to minify your JSON:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

The `-c` option in `jq` stands for "compact output". It ensures that the output JSON is compact (i.e., no unnecessary whitespace).

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can then use this output as an input to another command. For example:

```bash
http POST https://example.com/api/resource data=$(echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .)
```

This will send a POST request to `https://example.com/api/resource` with the minified JSON as the data.
