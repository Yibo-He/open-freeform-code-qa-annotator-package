In Office Pro Plus 2019, the FILTER function is not available. However, you can achieve the same result using an array formula with INDEX and SMALL functions or using a VBA Macro.

Here is the array formula approach:

1. Suppose you want to filter values from column B where column A is "x", and you want to put the result in column D starting from D2.
2. In cell D2, enter the following array formula:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW($A$1)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

3. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to enter the formula as an array formula.
4. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right of the cell) down to copy this formula to other cells in column D.

The formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then using the SMALL function to get the nth smallest value from this array, where n is the row number. The INDEX function then returns the value from column B at this row number.

Here is the VBA Macro approach:

1. Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
2. Click Insert > Module to create a new module.
3. Copy and paste the following code into the module:

```vba
Sub FilterColumn()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim i As Integer

    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    i = 1

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(i, "D").Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            i = i + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

4. Press Ctrl + S to save and F5 to run the macro.

This macro works by looping through each cell in column A, and if the cell value is "x", it copies the corresponding value from column B to column D.

Remember to replace "Sheet1" with the name of your worksheet, and "A1:A100" and "B1:B100" with your actual ranges.
