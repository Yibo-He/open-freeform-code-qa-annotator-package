From the logs you've provided, it seems like the Service Fabric Runtime installation is timing out after 10 minutes. This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as system resources being heavily utilized, network issues, or even antivirus software interfering with the installation.

Here are a few suggestions that might help you troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check System Resources:** Ensure that your system has enough resources (CPU, memory, disk space) to complete the installation. Close any unnecessary applications to free up resources.

2. **Disable Antivirus Temporarily:** Some antivirus software can interfere with installations. Try disabling your antivirus software temporarily and then attempt the installation again.

3. **Run as Administrator:** Make sure you are running the installer as an administrator. Right-click the installer and select "Run as administrator".

4. **Check Network:** If the installer needs to download additional components, network issues could cause the installation to fail. Check your network connection and try again.

5. **Clean Installation:** Try to perform a clean installation. Uninstall any existing Service Fabric Runtime and SDK components from your system, delete any remaining files or folders related to Service Fabric, and then try the installation again.

6. **Check for System Updates:** Ensure your system is up-to-date with the latest Windows updates.

If none of the above suggestions work, you might want to consider reaching out to Microsoft Support or the Service Fabric community on GitHub for further assistance.
