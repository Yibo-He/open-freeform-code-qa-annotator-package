The error you're encountering seems to be related to an issue with the Kotlin compiler. Here are a few steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Clean and Rebuild the Project**: This is the simplest solution and it often works. Go to `Build -> Clean Project` and then `Build -> Rebuild Project`.

2. **Invalidate Caches and Restart**: This option clears the local cache of your IDE and fetches the latest dependencies. Go to `File -> Invalidate Caches / Restart... -> Invalidate and Restart`.

3. **Update Kotlin Plugin**: Make sure you're using the latest version of the Kotlin plugin. Go to `File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Installed -> Kotlin -> Update`.

4. **Update Gradle Version**: Make sure you're using a compatible version of Gradle. You can update it in the `gradle-wrapper.properties` file.

5. **Check Your Dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are compatible with each other. Sometimes, different libraries can cause conflicts if they rely on different versions of the same dependency.

6. **Check Your Code**: Make sure there are no syntax errors or unresolved references in your code. The compiler error could be a result of an issue in your code.

If none of the above solutions work, you might want to consider filing a bug report with JetBrains, the company that maintains Kotlin.
