This error message is indicating that Xcode can't find the preview you're trying to display in any of the targets in your current scheme. This could be due to a variety of reasons, but here are a few things you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Clean the build folder**: You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`. This will remove all the compiled files and force Xcode to rebuild everything.

2. **Check your target membership**: Make sure that the file containing your preview is included in your target. You can do this by selecting the file in the Project Navigator and checking the Target Membership in the File Inspector.

3. **Restart Xcode and your computer**: Sometimes, Xcode can get into a weird state where it doesn't work properly. Restarting Xcode and your computer can often resolve these issues.

4. **Update Xcode**: If you're not already on the latest version of Xcode, updating might resolve this issue. Apple frequently releases updates to Xcode that fix bugs and improve stability.

5. **Check your scheme**: Make sure that your scheme is set up correctly. You can do this by going to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme`. Make sure that the correct target is selected and that the Build Configuration is set to Debug.

6. **Recreate the preview**: If none of the above solutions work, you can try recreating the preview. Delete the existing preview and create a new one.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug in Xcode. In that case, you should report it to Apple through their bug reporting system.
