Unfortunately, Power Automate does not currently support triggering flows directly from a keyboard shortcut or a command line script. However, there are workarounds you can use to achieve similar functionality.

One way is to use a third-party automation tool like AutoHotkey or AutoIt. These tools allow you to create scripts that can simulate mouse clicks and keystrokes, which can be used to start a Power Automate flow. Here's a basic example using AutoHotkey:

1. Install AutoHotkey from https://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Create a new script file with the .ahk extension (e.g., start_flow.ahk)
3. Open the script file in a text editor and paste the following code:

```autohotkey
^!s::
Run, "C:\Path\To\PowerAutomate.exe"
WinWaitActive, Power Automate
Click, 100, 200  ; coordinates of the Play button
return
```

This script will start Power Automate and click the Play button when you press Ctrl+Alt+S. You'll need to replace "C:\Path\To\PowerAutomate.exe" with the actual path to Power Automate, and adjust the coordinates of the Click command to match the position of the Play button on your screen.

Another way is to use the Power Automate API to trigger flows programmatically. This requires more technical knowledge and involves creating a custom application in Azure AD, but it gives you more flexibility and control. You can find more information about this approach in the Power Automate documentation: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/developer/apis

Please note that these are just workarounds and may not work perfectly in all situations. If you need this feature, I recommend submitting a feature request to the Power Automate team.
