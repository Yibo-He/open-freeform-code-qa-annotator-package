The issue you're experiencing is due to the way you're trying to access the properties array. In your ForEach loop, `card` is not an index, it's an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`. So when you're trying to use `card` as an index, it's causing an error.

Here's how you can fix it:

```swift
ForEach(properties, id: \.self) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`, so you can directly access its `label` and `value` properties. Also, please note that you need to make sure your `Unicards.HPropert` conforms to `Hashable` protocol to use it in `ForEach` loop.
