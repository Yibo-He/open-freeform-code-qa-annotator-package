You can achieve this by using the `IFS` (Internal Field Separator) variable in Bash. The `IFS` variable is used in Bash to determine how word splitting will occur after expansions. By default, it's set to whitespace (space, tab, and newline), but you can change it to any character you want.

Here is how you can do it:

```bash
IFS=","
echo "${data[*]}"
```

This will print all elements in the array separated by a comma. Please note that this change to `IFS` will only be effective for this single command.

If you want to store the output in a variable, you can do it like this:

```bash
IFS=","
output="${data[*]}"
echo $output
```

This will store the comma-separated values in the `output` variable.
