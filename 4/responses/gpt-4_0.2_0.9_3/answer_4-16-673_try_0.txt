The problem you're facing is because the version of cmake in the official Ubuntu repositories may not be the latest. To get the latest version, you can download it from the official CMake website. Here are the steps:

1. First, remove the existing version of cmake:

```bash
sudo apt-get remove cmake
```

2. Then, download the latest version of cmake from the official website. As of now, the latest version is 3.21.1. You can download it using wget:

```bash
wget https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/releases/download/v3.21.1/cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

3. Extract the downloaded file:

```bash
tar -xzvf cmake-3.21.1.tar.gz
```

4. Navigate to the extracted directory:

```bash
cd cmake-3.21.1/
```

5. Now, run the bootstrap script:

```bash
./bootstrap
```

6. Once the bootstrap script is done, compile the source code:

```bash
make
```

7. Finally, install cmake:

```bash
sudo make install
```

8. Verify the installed version of cmake:

```bash
cmake --version
```

This should show you the version 3.21.1 (or whatever the latest version you installed).

Please note that compiling from source like this will take some time. Be patient and wait for the process to complete.
