In SwiftUI, you can create spacing between `List` items by adding padding to the items. 

You can add padding to the `Button` in your `List` like this:

```swift
Button(action: {print("pressed")}) {
    Text(rate.hebrewCurrencyName)
}
.padding(.vertical, 10)
```

This will add 10 points of padding to the top and bottom of each button, effectively creating space between each item in the list.

If you want to add space between the `Image` and the `Button`, you can use a `HStack` with a `Spacer`:

```swift
HStack {
    Image(systemName: "plus")
    Spacer()
    Button(action: {print("pressed")}) {
        Text(rate.hebrewCurrencyName)
    }
}
.padding(.vertical, 10)
```

This will create a horizontal stack of views with space between the `Image` and the `Button`.

If you want to add more space, you can adjust the amount of padding or the size of the `Spacer`.
