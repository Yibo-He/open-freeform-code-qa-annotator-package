The error message you're seeing indicates that the `/data` directory is on a filesystem that has been mounted as read-only. This means you cannot make changes to it, including creating new directories.

Here are a few steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check the filesystem status**: Use the `mount` command without any arguments to check the status of all mounted filesystems. Look for the `/data` entry and see if it's been mounted as read-only (ro).

2. **Remount the filesystem as read-write**: If the filesystem is indeed read-only, you can try to remount it as read-write using the following command:

   ```
   sudo mount -o remount,rw /data
   ```

   If `/data` is not a mount point itself, you need to find the mount point that contains `/data` and remount that. You can use `df /data` to find the mount point.

3. **Check for filesystem errors**: If you can't remount the filesystem as read-write, it's possible that there are filesystem errors that need to be fixed. You can use the `fsck` command to check and repair filesystem errors. Note that you should unmount the filesystem before running `fsck`:

   ```
   sudo umount /data
   sudo fsck /dev/sdXN  # replace sdXN with your actual device name
   ```

   After fixing any errors, try to mount the filesystem again and see if you can create the directory.

4. **Check for hardware issues**: If none of the above steps work, it's possible that there are hardware issues with the storage device. Check the system logs for any error messages related to the device.

Remember to replace `/data` with your actual directory path if it's different.
