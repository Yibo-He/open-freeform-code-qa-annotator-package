1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key. Here's the command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you to enter a passphrase. If you don't want to use a passphrase, just press enter when prompted.

2. No, you don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have different versions like the private key. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about it.
