The error message you're seeing is a bit cryptic, but it's essentially saying that Xcode can't find the SwiftUI preview you're trying to display. This could be due to a number of reasons, but here are a few things you can try:

1. **Clean your project**: Sometimes Xcode can get confused with old build artifacts. You can clean your project by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Check your scheme**: Make sure that your scheme is set up correctly. Go to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme` and make sure that your target is selected in the `Build` section.

3. **Check your target membership**: Make sure that the file containing your SwiftUI preview is included in your target. You can do this by selecting the file in the Project Navigator and checking the `Target Membership` section in the File Inspector.

4. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes Xcode can get into a weird state and a simple restart can fix the issue.

5. **Update Xcode**: If you're not already on the latest version of Xcode, it might be worth updating. Apple has made a lot of improvements to SwiftUI and its previews in recent updates.

6. **Recreate the SwiftUI preview**: If all else fails, you might want to try recreating the SwiftUI preview. Delete the existing preview and create a new one.

If none of these suggestions work, it might be worth posting on the Apple Developer Forums or filing a bug with Apple. It's possible that this is a bug in Xcode itself.
