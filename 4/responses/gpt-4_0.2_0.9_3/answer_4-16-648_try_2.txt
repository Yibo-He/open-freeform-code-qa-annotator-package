The error message you're seeing indicates that the `/data` directory is on a read-only file system. This means you don't have permission to write to this directory, which is why you can't create a new folder there.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the file system**: Use the `df` command to check what file system the directory is on. Then use `mount` to check the permissions of that file system.

```bash
df /data
mount | grep filesystem
```

Replace `filesystem` with the file system you found from the `df` command.

2. **Remount as read-write**: If the file system is indeed read-only, you can try remounting it as read-write. However, this could cause issues if the file system was set to read-only for a reason.

```bash
sudo mount -o remount,rw /data
```

3. **Check for file system errors**: If the file system is read-only, it might be because there are file system errors that need to be fixed. You can use `fsck` to check for and fix these errors.

```bash
sudo fsck /dev/sdXY
```

Replace `/dev/sdXY` with the device and partition number for your file system.

4. **Use a different directory**: If you can't get write access to the `/data` directory, you might need to use a different directory. You should have write access to your home directory, so you could create the new folder there.

```bash
mkdir ~/data/db
```

Remember, it's important to understand why a file system is read-only before trying to change its permissions. If you're not sure, it's a good idea to ask for help from someone who knows more about your specific system.
