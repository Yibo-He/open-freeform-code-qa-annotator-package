If your SwiftUI preview is not showing up, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check your macOS and Xcode versions**: SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina and Xcode 11 or later. Make sure your software is up to date.

2. **Check your device and OS in the preview**: Make sure you're previewing for a device that supports SwiftUI. Also, ensure that the OS version in the preview is compatible with SwiftUI.

3. **Try to resume the preview**: Sometimes, the preview might not show up because it's paused. You can resume it by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top-right corner of the canvas.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project**: You can do this by going to "Product" > "Clean Build Folder" and then "Product" > "Build" in the Xcode menu.

5. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, Xcode might have a glitch that can be fixed by simply restarting the software.

6. **Check your code for errors**: If there are any errors in your code, the preview might not show up. Make sure your code compiles without errors.

7. **Try creating a new SwiftUI file**: If none of the above steps work, try creating a new SwiftUI file and see if the preview shows up there. If it does, there might be something wrong with your original file.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your setup (macOS version, Xcode version, etc.) and any error messages you're seeing.
