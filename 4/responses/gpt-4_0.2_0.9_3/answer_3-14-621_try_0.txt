The error you're seeing is because `@State` variables are designed to be managed by SwiftUI, and you're not supposed to change them outside of the SwiftUI view's body. 

However, you can use a different property wrapper, `@StateObject`, to create a custom ObservableObject that can be initialized with a value. Here's an example:

```swift
class TextModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var fullText: String

    init(fullText: String) {
        self.fullText = fullText
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]

    @StateObject var textModel: TextModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _textModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: TextModel(fullText: list[letter] ?? ""))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $textModel.fullText)
    }
}
```

In this example, `TextModel` is a class that conforms to `ObservableObject` and has a `@Published` property `fullText`. You can initialize `TextModel` with a value for `fullText`, and SwiftUI will observe changes to `fullText` and update the view as needed.
