The error message "permission denied" typically means that the script `startup.sh` does not have the necessary execute permissions. 

You can add execute permissions to the script by running the following command:

```bash
chmod +x startup.sh
```

This command changes the mode of the script to include execute permissions for the user. After running this command, you should be able to start the script with `./startup.sh nginx:start`.
