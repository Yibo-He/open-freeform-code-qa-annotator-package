You can use command substitution `$(command)` to print the content of the file within the heredoc. Here is how you can modify your script:

```bash
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will replace `$(cat file)` with the content of the file when the script is run.
