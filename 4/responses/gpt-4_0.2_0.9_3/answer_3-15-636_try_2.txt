Based on your description, it seems like you want to split your data into multiple sheets within the same workbook based on a specific column, and you want the data in each sheet to be formatted in a certain way.

Here is a simplified version of your macro that should do what you want:

```vba
Sub SplitData()

    Dim OriginalWs As Worksheet
    Dim NewWs As Worksheet
    Dim CurrentCell As Range
    Dim ColumnToSplit As Range
    Dim LastRow As Long
    Dim UniqueValues As Collection
    Dim Value As Variant
    
    ' Set the original worksheet
    Set OriginalWs = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    ' Find the last row in the column you want to split by
    LastRow = OriginalWs.Cells(OriginalWs.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Set the range of cells you want to split by
    Set ColumnToSplit = OriginalWs.Range("A2:A" & LastRow)
    
    ' Create a new collection to store unique values in the column
    Set UniqueValues = New Collection
    
    ' Loop through each cell in the column
    For Each CurrentCell In ColumnToSplit
        ' Try to add the cell's value to the collection
        On Error Resume Next
        UniqueValues.Add CurrentCell.Value, CStr(CurrentCell.Value)
        On Error GoTo 0
    Next CurrentCell
    
    ' Loop through each unique value in the collection
    For Each Value In UniqueValues
        ' Add a new worksheet for the unique value
        Set NewWs = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add(After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Count))
        NewWs.Name = Value
        
        ' Filter the original worksheet by the unique value
        OriginalWs.Rows(1).AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:=Value
        
        ' Copy the visible (filtered) cells to the new worksheet
        OriginalWs.Cells.Copy Destination:=NewWs.Cells
        
        ' Turn off the filter in the original worksheet
        OriginalWs.AutoFilterMode = False
    Next Value

End Sub
```

This macro will create a new worksheet for each unique value in column A of the original worksheet. It will then filter the original worksheet by that value and copy the visible cells to the new worksheet.

Please replace "Sheet1" with the name of your original worksheet and "A" with the column you want to split by.

You can add your formatting code to the end of the loop to format each new worksheet as desired.
