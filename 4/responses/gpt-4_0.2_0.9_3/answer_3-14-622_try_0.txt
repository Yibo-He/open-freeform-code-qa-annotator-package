The error is because `fill(_:)` method expects a type that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol. `Color` is a type that conforms to `ShapeStyle`, but `RedView` is not. 

To conform `RedView` to `ShapeStyle`, you can create a custom `ShapeStyle` struct that wraps your `RedView`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `RedShapeStyle` is a custom `ShapeStyle` that applies `Color.red` to the shape. Now you can use `RedShapeStyle` to fill your `Circle`.
