You can use `jq` to uglify JSON in bash. `jq` is a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor. If it's not installed, you can install it using package managers like `apt`, `brew`, `yum`, etc.

Here is how you can use it:

```bash
echo '{
    "foo": "lorem",
    "bar": "ipsum"
}' | jq -c .
```

The `-c` option in `jq` stands for "compact output". It will remove all the unnecessary whitespaces.

This will output:

```bash
{"foo":"lorem","bar":"ipsum"}
```

You can then use this output in another command as you wish.
