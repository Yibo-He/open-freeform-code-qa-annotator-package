The convention for character names in ZSH is generally descriptive. For example, `forward-char` refers to moving the cursor forward by one character, and `end-of-line` refers to moving the cursor to the end of the line.

The Tab key is usually represented as `expand-or-complete` or `magic-space` in ZSH. So, if you want to set the Tab key for the ZSH autocompletion plugin, you should use one of these names.

Here is how you can modify your configuration:

```bash
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                expand-or-complete //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```

This configuration will make the Tab key accept the entire suggestion provided by the ZSH autocompletion plugin.
