The error message suggests that your application is not being recognized as a Hilt application. This is because your application is being treated as a `MultiDexApplication` instead of your `CoreApplication` which is annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. You might have forgotten to specify your application class in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Make sure you have the following line in your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...>
</application>
```

2. If you are using a library that automatically initializes itself (like Firebase), it might be initializing itself before Hilt. In this case, you need to disable the automatic initialization and initialize it manually after Hilt.

3. If you are using custom Application class, make sure it extends `Application` and is annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`.

4. If you are using multidex, make sure you have enabled it correctly. In your build.gradle file, you should have:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
}
```

And in your Application class:

```kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class CoreApplication : MultiDexApplication() {
    ...
}
```

5. If none of the above solutions work, try cleaning and rebuilding your project. Sometimes, the build cache can cause issues.
