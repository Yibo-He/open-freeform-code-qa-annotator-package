In GitHub Actions, you can access environment variables using the `env` context. However, the syntax you're using is incorrect. You should use `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}` instead of `${{ env:CURRENT_BRANCH }}`.

Here's the correct way to use it:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This will correctly reference the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable that you've set in a previous step.
