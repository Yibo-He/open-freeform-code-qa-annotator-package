You can use the `uname -m` command to get the machine hardware name. On M1 Macs, this command returns "arm64". Here's how you can use this in a shell script:

```bash
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ]; then
    echo "Running on M1"
else
    echo "Not running on M1"
fi
```

This script will print "Running on M1" if it's running on an M1 Mac, and "Not running on M1" otherwise.

Please note that this will also return "arm64" on other arm64 machines, not just M1 Macs. If you need to specifically target M1 Macs, you can use the `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` command, which gives more detailed information about the CPU:

```bash
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ] && [ "$(sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string)" = "Apple M1" ]; then
    echo "Running on M1"
else
    echo "Not running on M1"
fi
```

This script will only print "Running on M1" if it's running on an M1 Mac.
