You can achieve this by using command substitution in your bash script. Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. It occurs when a command is enclosed as follows: `$(command)`. 

Here is how you can modify your `run.sh` script:

```bash
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

In this script, `$(cat file)` will be replaced by the content of the file. When you run `./run.sh`, it will generate `test.sh` with the desired output.
