The error message you're seeing is indicating that the `TextInputLayout` component from the Material Design library requires your app theme to be `Theme.MaterialComponents` or a descendant.

In your `styles.xml` file, you have defined your `AppTheme` to be a descendant of `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.NoActionBar`. This should be compatible with the `TextInputLayout` component.

However, in your updated `styles.xml` file, you have defined your `AppTheme` to be a descendant of `Theme.MaterialComponents.Light.DarkActionBar`. This is also a descendant of `Theme.MaterialComponents` and should be compatible with the `TextInputLayout` component.

One possible issue could be a mismatch between the versions of the Material Components library and the AndroidX AppCompat library that you're using. The Material Components library is a replacement for the Design Support Library and includes updated versions of the Design library's components. If you're using the Material Components library, you should make sure that you're also using a compatible version of the AndroidX AppCompat library.

You can check the versions of these libraries that you're using in your `build.gradle` file. If you're using an older version of the AndroidX AppCompat library, you may need to update it to a newer version that's compatible with the version of the Material Components library that you're using.

If updating the library versions doesn't resolve the issue, another possible cause could be a conflict between the theme you're using and the style you've defined for your `TextInputLayout` component. You could try removing the `style="@style/EditText.OutlinedBox"` attribute from your `TextInputLayout` component to see if that resolves the issue.

If none of these suggestions resolve the issue, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error message you're seeing so we can help you troubleshoot further.
