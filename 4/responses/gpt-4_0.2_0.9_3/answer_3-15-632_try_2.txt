Based on your code and the sample input, it seems like you're trying to split a line of text into separate columns in Excel. The line of text you're trying to split looks like this:

```
Cabinet No.  Subrack No.  Slot No.  TX Channel No.  VSWR(0.01)
```

You can use the `Split` function in VBA to split a string into an array, and then assign the elements of the array to the appropriate cells. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim parts() As String
    parts = Split(textline, "  ") 'split the line into an array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = parts(0) 'Cabinet No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = parts(1) 'Subrack No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = parts(2) 'Slot No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = parts(3) 'TX Channel No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = parts(4) 'VSWR(0.01)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that the values in the line are separated by two spaces. If they're separated by a different number of spaces or a different character, you'll need to adjust the argument to the `Split` function accordingly.

Also, please note that the array `parts` is zero-based, so `parts(0)` is the first element, `parts(1)` is the second, and so on.
