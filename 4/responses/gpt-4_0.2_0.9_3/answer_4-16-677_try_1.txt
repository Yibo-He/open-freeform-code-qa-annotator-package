The issue is with the single quotes around the variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning the actual value of the variable will not be used. You should use double quotes instead. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this corrected script, the variable `$searchT` is properly expanded within the `grep` command. Also, I moved `wc -l` to correctly count the number of matches.
