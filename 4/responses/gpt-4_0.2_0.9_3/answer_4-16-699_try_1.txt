The `lastIndexOf` method returns the last index of the specified string, which is not what you want in this case. You want to find the index of `-354` and then add 4 to it (to include `-354` in the substring). 

Here is how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $index = $n.IndexOf("-354")
     if($index -ne -1) {
         Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $index+4)
     }
}
```

This script will output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

This script works by finding the index of `-354` in each string, and then using the `Substring` method to get a substring from the start of the string to the end of `-354`. If `-354` is not found in the string, `IndexOf` returns `-1`, and in that case, we don't print anything.
