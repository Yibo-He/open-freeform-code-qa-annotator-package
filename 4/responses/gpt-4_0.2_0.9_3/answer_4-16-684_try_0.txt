The correct syntax to use environment variables in GitHub Actions is `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`. So in your case, it should be `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}`.

Here is the corrected code:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This will correctly evaluate the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable that you set in the previous step.
