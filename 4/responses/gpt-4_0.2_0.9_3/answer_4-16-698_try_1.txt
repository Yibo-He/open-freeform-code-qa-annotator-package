You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, it will apply those changes to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, and you've made changes to `.zshrc`, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Remember, this won't "restart" your terminal session, but it will apply any new changes you've made to your shell configuration file.
