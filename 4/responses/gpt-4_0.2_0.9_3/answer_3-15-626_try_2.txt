The code you provided seems to be trying to create a new query table in the active sheet using the Power Query query stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. You are trying to use the `query` and `currentSheet` as objects, but you are assigning them string values. You need to declare them as appropriate object types (like `Range` or `Worksheet`) and set them accordingly.

2. The `query` variable is being assigned the value of a cell, but later in the code you are trying to use it as if it were a `WorkbookQuery` object. If you want to use the text from the Power Query Advanced Editor, you will need to create a new `WorkbookQuery` object and set its `Formula` property to the text from the cell.

3. The `Location` property in the connection string should be the name of the query, not the name of the sheet or range where the query text is stored.

4. The `Destination` property in the `ListObjects.Add` method should be a `Range` object that represents the top-left cell where you want the query results to be placed.

Here is a revised version of your code that should work:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    Dim destination As Range
    Dim queryTable As QueryTable

    ' Get the query text from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Set the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Set the destination range
    Set destination = Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1")

    ' Create a new query table in the current sheet
    Set queryTable = currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=destination).QueryTable

    ' Set the properties of the query table
    With queryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

Please note that this code assumes that the text in cell A1 of Sheet6 is a valid Power Query query. If it's not, you will need to modify the code to create a valid `WorkbookQuery` object.
