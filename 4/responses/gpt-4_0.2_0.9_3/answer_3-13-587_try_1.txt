The error message you're seeing is related to the version of Jacoco you're using. The version 0.8.6 of Jacoco does not support Java 15, which is used by Kotlin 1.5.10. 

To fix this issue, you need to upgrade your Jacoco version to 0.8.7 which supports Java 15. 

Here is how you can do it:

```groovy
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

After updating the Jacoco version, try to run the test coverage report task again. If you still encounter issues, please let me know.
