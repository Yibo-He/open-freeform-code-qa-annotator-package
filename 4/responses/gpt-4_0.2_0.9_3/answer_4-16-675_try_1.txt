You can use the `git` command to show the current branch name in your terminal. 

Here is a simple command to display the current branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

This command will return the name of the current branch.

If you want to display the branch name in your terminal prompt like in bash, you can modify your PS1 (Prompt String 1) variable in your bash profile. 

Here is a simple example:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

This will display the username, host, and current git branch in your terminal prompt.

To make this change permanent, you need to add this line to your bash profile. The bash profile is located in your home directory and is named `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` depending on your system. You can open it with a text editor and add the line at the end of the file.

Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your bash profile with a text editor. You can use `nano` for example:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the line at the end of the file:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

3. Save and close the file. If you used `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and then `Enter`.

4. To apply the changes, you need to source your bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your terminal prompt should display the current git branch.
