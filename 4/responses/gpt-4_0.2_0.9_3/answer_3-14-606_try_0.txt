This alert is indicating that the app you're trying to open is a developer build, which requires your device to be in Developer Mode to run. Developer Mode is a setting that exposes developer-oriented features that are not visible in normal mode. 

Here's how you can enable Developer Mode on your iOS device:

1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac.
2. Open Xcode on your Mac.
3. Go to Window > Devices and Simulators.
4. Select your device from the list on the left.
5. Check the "Show as run destination" box.

This should enable Developer Mode on your device, allowing you to run the app.

If you're still having trouble, make sure that:

- Your device is properly connected to your Mac.
- You have the latest version of Xcode installed.
- Your device is running a compatible version of iOS.
- You have the necessary permissions to enable Developer Mode on the device.

If you've checked all of these and are still having issues, it may be a problem with the app itself, in which case you should contact the app's developer for further assistance.
