Hello Tenttu,

It seems like you've already identified the issue correctly. The error message you're receiving is typically related to permissions, but as you've mentioned, your account is a Global Admin and you haven't made any changes to the roles. 

This, combined with the fact that many others are experiencing the same issue, strongly suggests that the problem is on Microsoft's end. 

The best course of action in this situation is exactly what you've done: open a ticket with Microsoft. They should be able to provide more information and hopefully a resolution. 

In the meantime, you can monitor the status of the issue (EX280152) on the Microsoft 365 Service Health dashboard. 

I hope the issue gets resolved soon. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

Best regards.
