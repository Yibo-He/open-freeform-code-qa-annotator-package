You can open Windows Explorer at "This PC" by using the following command in CMD or PowerShell:

```cmd
explorer.exe /e,::{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}
```

This command uses the CLSID (Class Identifier) for "This PC", which is `{20D04FE0-3AEA-1069-A2D8-08002B30309D}`. The `/e,` switch tells Explorer to open a specific folder or directory.
