From your code, it seems you are inflating the layout twice which is unnecessary and could be causing the issue. Once you have inflated the layout using `FragmentHomeBinding.inflate()`, you should use the `binding` object to access the views.

Here is how you should do it:

```kotlin
override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater,
    container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    val homeViewModel =
        ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

    _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
    val root: View = binding.root

    binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

    binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
        Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        println("Generated a new exercise")
    }

    return root
}
```

In this code, `binding.exercise` and `binding.btnNewExercise` are used to access the `EditText` and `Button` views respectively. The `requireContext()` function is used to get the context in the `Toast.makeText()` function.

Also, make sure that the ids `exercise` and `btnNewExercise` are correctly set in your `fragment_home.xml` layout file. If the ids are incorrect, you will get a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the views.
