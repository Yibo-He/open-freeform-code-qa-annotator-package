The issue is that you're trying to use `card` as an index, but in the context of your `ForEach`, `card` is not an index, it's an element of `properties`.

In your `ForEach` loop, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`, not an index. So when you're trying to use `card` as an index in `properties[card].label` and `properties[card].value`, you're getting an error because `card` is not an integer.

You should directly use `card.label` and `card.value` instead of `properties[card].label` and `properties[card].value`. Here's the corrected code:

```swift
ForEach(properties) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
