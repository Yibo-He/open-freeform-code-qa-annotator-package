Yes, you can achieve the same result in Excel 2019 using an array formula or a VBA macro.

Here's how you can do it with an array formula:

1. Suppose you want to put the result in column D, starting from D2. In D2, enter the following formula:
```
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$2:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$2:$A$100="x", ROW($A$2:$A$100)-ROW($A$2)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to enter it as an array formula. Excel will surround the formula with curly braces {} to indicate it's an array formula.
3. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to copy the formula to other cells in column D.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then using the SMALL function to get the k-th smallest value from this array, where k is the row number of the current cell in column D. The INDEX function then returns the value in column B at this row number.

If you prefer using a VBA macro, here's a simple one that does the same thing:

```vba
Sub FilterColumnA()
    Dim rng As Range, cell As Range
    Dim i As Long

    Set rng = Range("A2:A100")
    i = 2

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            Cells(i, "D").Value = Cells(cell.Row, "B").Value
            i = i + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro loops through each cell in column A, and if the cell's value is "x", it copies the value from the same row in column B to column D. The variable `i` keeps track of the next row in column D to copy to.
