You can achieve this by using command substitution in bash. Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
$cat run.sh
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

In this script, `$(cat file)` will be replaced by the content of the file. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create `test.sh` with the desired output.
