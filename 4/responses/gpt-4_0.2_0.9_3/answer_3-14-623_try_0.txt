This error can be caused by a variety of issues, but here are some common solutions that you can try:

1. **Clean the project**: In Xcode, select `Product > Clean` from the menu. Then try to build the project again.

2. **Delete Derived Data**: Go to `Window > Organizer > Projects`, select your project, and click `Delete` next to `Derived Data`. Then try to build the project again.

3. **Check Swift Version**: Make sure that all your Pods are compatible with the Swift version you are using. You can specify the Swift version for each Pod in the Podfile. For example:

    ```ruby
    post_install do |installer|
        installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
            target.build_configurations.each do |config|
                config.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = '4.2' # or '5.0', '5.1', etc.
            end
        end
    end
    ```

4. **Update CocoaPods**: Make sure you are using the latest version of CocoaPods. You can update it by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal.

5. **Reinstall Pods**: Try deleting the `Podfile.lock` file and the `Pods` directory, then run `pod install` again.

6. **Check for Compiler Errors**: The "Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exit code" error can also be caused by compiler errors in your Swift code. Check the error details in Xcode to see if there are any specific Swift compiler errors that you can fix.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to downgrade to a previous version of Xcode that is known to work with your project and Pods.
