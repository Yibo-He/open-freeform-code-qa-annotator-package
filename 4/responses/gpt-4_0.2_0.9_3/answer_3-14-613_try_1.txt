This error message is indicating that Xcode is having trouble finding the preview instance for your ContentView_Previews. This could be due to a number of reasons, but here are a few things you can try:

1. **Clean the build folder**: Sometimes, Xcode can get confused with old build artifacts. You can clean the build folder by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder` or by pressing `Shift + Command + K`.

2. **Restart Xcode**: This might seem obvious, but sometimes, simply restarting Xcode can fix the issue.

3. **Check your scheme settings**: Make sure that your scheme is set up correctly. Go to `Product > Scheme > Edit Scheme` and make sure that the correct target is selected.

4. **Check your preview code**: Make sure that your preview code is correct and that it's inside the correct file. In your case, it should be inside `ContentView.swift`.

5. **Update your Xcode**: If you're not using the latest version of Xcode, consider updating it. Apple frequently releases updates that fix bugs and improve performance.

6. **Recreate the file**: If none of the above solutions work, try recreating the file where your preview code is located. There might be some hidden issues that are causing the problem.

If none of these solutions work, it might be a bug with Xcode itself. In that case, consider filing a bug report with Apple.
