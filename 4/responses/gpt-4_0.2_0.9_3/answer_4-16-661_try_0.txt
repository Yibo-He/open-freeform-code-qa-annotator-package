The output you're getting is because the SQLPlus command is returning all the output including the connection details, SQL prompt, and the query result. 

To get only the result of the query, you can use the `-s` option in SQLPlus which stands for silent mode. This will suppress the display of SQLPlus banner, prompts, and echoing of commands.

Also, you need to set the `feedback off` and `heading off` to avoid column names and other feedback messages.

Here is the updated script:

```bash
size=`${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -s $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
set feedback off;
set heading off;
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF`
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

This script will return only the result of the query. Please replace `'XXXX'` with the actual owner name.
