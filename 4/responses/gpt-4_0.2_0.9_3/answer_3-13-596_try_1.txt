The `myprogram-0.0.1-plain.jar` is generated by the `bootJar` task in Spring Boot 2.5.0. This task is responsible for creating an executable jar. The `plain.jar` is a non-executable jar that is also created by this task.

If you want to disable the generation of the `plain.jar` file, you can configure the `bootJar` task in your `build.gradle` file to not include the `classifier` which is responsible for the `-plain` suffix. Here's how you can do it:

```groovy
bootJar {
    enabled = true
    classifier = null
}
```

This will tell Gradle to not include a classifier in the jar name, thus not generating the `plain.jar` file. 

Please note that this will only generate the executable jar, and if you need a non-executable jar for some reason, you will need to generate it separately.
