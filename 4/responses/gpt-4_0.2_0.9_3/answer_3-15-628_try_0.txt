The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` is trying to evaluate the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)`, which is a reference to a cell, not a named range. 

To solve this, you need to evaluate the cell that `INDIRECT(B14)` is referring to, and then compare that to `"list1"`. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)

If rng.Value = "list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

This code first evaluates the `INDIRECT` formula to get the range that it's referring to, and then compares the value of that range to `"list1"`. If they are equal, it executes your code.

Please note that this code assumes that `B14` contains the name of a named range (like `"list1"`). If `B14` contains a cell reference (like `"A1"`), you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

Also, please be aware that this code will only work if the cell that `B14` is referring to contains a single value. If it contains an array of values, you'll need to use a loop to compare each value to `"list1"`.
