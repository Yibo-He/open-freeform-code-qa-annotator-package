The colors in your terminal are not determined by iTerm2, but by the shell that you are using. In your case, it looks like you are using bash. The prompt (username, hostname, path) colors are set in a file called `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` in your home directory.

To change the colors, you need to set the `PS1` variable in your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`. Here's an example of how you can change it:

1. Open your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file in a text editor. If you're not sure which one to use, try `.bash_profile` first. If it doesn't exist or doesn't work, try `.bashrc`.

```bash
nano ~/.bash_profile
```

2. Add the following lines to the file:

```bash
export CLICOLOR=1
export LSCOLORS=ExFxBxDxCxegedabagacad
export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
```

This will set your username and hostname to green (`\[\033[01;32m\]`), and your path to blue (`\[\033[01;34m\]`). The `\[\033[00m\]` resets the color.

3. Save the file and exit the text editor. If you're using nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y`, then `Enter`.

4. Reload your `.bash_profile` or `.bashrc` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now your prompt should have the colors you set. You can customize the colors by changing the color codes in the `PS1` variable. Here are some common ones:

- Black: `\[\033[0;30m\]`
- Red: `\[\033[0;31m\]`
- Green: `\[\033[0;32m\]`
- Brown/Orange: `\[\033[0;33m\]`
- Blue: `\[\033[0;34m\]`
- Purple: `\[\033[0;35m\]`
- Cyan: `\[\033[0;36m\]`
- Light Gray: `\[\033[0;37m\]`

For the bold or lighter versions, replace the `0` with `1`, like `\[\033[1;31m\]` for light red.
