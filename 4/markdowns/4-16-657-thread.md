I got a  script that do some automatic procedures, I use a "Write-Host" at the end of each one of them to tell the technical user that step is finished, but I realize is kind of hard to read and keep track so, Â¿Is there a way to output a bold text?

Thank you in advance.

Just wording...
Seen from the ['ConvertFrom-MarkDown`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.utility/convertfrom-markdown?view=powershell-7) cmdlet (included with PowerShell 6 and higher),  [bold](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/#bold) text actually exists:


```
('This is **Bold** text' | ConvertFrom-MarkDown -AsVt100EncodedString).VT100EncodedString
```


[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/OU6W0.png)

But this is not completely fair, as behind the scenes, it is a matter of playing with colors. Knowing that the default foregroundcolor is `Gray` and `White` is just a little brigther and therefore looks .
Meaning that the above statement is similar to:

```
Write-Host 'This is ' -NoNewline; Write-Host -ForegroundColor White 'Bold ' -NoNewline; Write-Host 'Text'
```

> [Console Virtual Terminal Sequences](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/console/console-virtual-terminal-sequences#span-idtextformattingspanspan-idtextformattingspanspan-idtextformattingspantext-formatting)

Starting in PowerShell 5.1, the PowerShell console supports VT escape sequences that can be used to position and format console text. Note that this 

```
# Enable underline
$esc = [char]27
"$esc[4mOutput is now underlined!"

# Disable underline
$esc = [char]27
"$esc[0mReset"
```


Or as pointed out already, with Write-Host, just switch the text color inline for contrast...

```
Write-Host -ForegroundColor gray 'This is not bold ' -NoNewline
Write-Host -ForegroundColor White 'This is Bold ' -NoNewline
Write-Host -ForegroundColor gray 'This is not bold'
```


... that is if you did not download or can't download and use external stuff.

As far as I know it is not possible, but you can change the  and  of the text. This way you can output text in different colors, so you can highlight an error or a warning.

This displays a red text:

```
Write-Host "This text is red" -ForegroundColor red
```


This displays a blue text on a red background:

```
Write-Host "This text is blue" -ForegroundColor blue -BackgroundColor red
```
