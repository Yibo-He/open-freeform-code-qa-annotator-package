I have a file `file1` which ends with
`Success...` OR
`success...`
I want to `grep` for the word `success` in a way which is not case sensitive way.
I have written the following command but it is case sensitive
```
cat file1 | grep "success\.\.\."
```

How can i change it so that it `returns 0` with both `Success...` OR
`success...`

You can use the `-i` option with `grep` to make your search case insensitive. Here is how you can modify your command:

```bash
cat file1 | grep -i "success\.\.\."
```

This command will return lines containing either `Success...` or `success...`.

Also, you can directly use `grep` on the file without using `cat`:

```bash
grep -i "success\.\.\." file1
```

You can use the `-i` option with `grep` to make your search case-insensitive. Here is how you can modify your command:

```bash
cat file1 | grep -i "success\.\.\."
```

This command will return lines containing either `Success...` or `success...`. The `-i` option tells `grep` to ignore case, so it treats uppercase and lowercase letters as the same.
