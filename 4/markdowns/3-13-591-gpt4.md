In my application I want used  function and I want return !
I set return value from function and I write below codes, but show me  value!

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>): String {
    var itemSelected = ""
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
    Log.e("categoryLog","2 : " +itemSelected)
    return itemSelected
}
```

When show logs in , first show 2 then show 1 !

```
2022-08-12 14:49:59.261 12074-12074/com.my.app E/categoryLog: 2 : 
2022-08-12 14:49:59.310 12074-12074/com.my.app E/categoryLog: 1 : Movies
```

Why first call  then call  ?!
I used this  in fragment and for this when used this in `fragment` show me  value!
How can I fix it?

The issue you're encountering is due to the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is not called immediately when you set the listener, it is called later when an item is actually selected in the spinner. 

So, when you're setting up the spinner and its listener, the `return itemSelected` line is executed before any item is selected, hence it returns an empty string.

To fix this, you need to change your approach a bit. Instead of trying to return the selected item from the `setupListWithAdapter` function, you should handle the selected item inside the `onItemSelected` method itself.

Here's an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            // Handle the selected item here
            // For example, you can call another function and pass the selected item to it
            handleItemSelected(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}

fun handleItemSelected(item: String) {
    // Do something with the selected item
}
```

In this example, when an item is selected in the spinner, the `handleItemSelected` function is called with the selected item as a parameter. You can replace `handleItemSelected` with any function you want to execute when an item is selected.

The reason why you are seeing log 2 before log 1 is because of the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is not called immediately when you set the listener, it is called later when an item is actually selected in the spinner. 

However, the `return` statement and the log 2 are executed immediately after you set the listener, not waiting for an item to be selected. That's why you see log 2 before log 1, and why the function returns an empty string if no item has been selected yet.

To fix this, you could use a callback function to return the selected item when it is actually selected. Here is an example:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected) // call the callback function with the selected item
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then you can use the function like this:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // do something with selectedItem
}
```

This way, the `selectedItem` is returned to you as soon as it is selected in the spinner.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The reason you are seeing log 2 before log 1 is because of the asynchronous nature of the `onItemSelectedListener`. The `onItemSelected` function is only called when an item is selected in the spinner, which is likely to happen after the setup function has already returned.

The `setupListWithAdapter` function doesn't wait for an item to be selected. It sets up the listener and then immediately returns `itemSelected`, which at this point is still an empty string. That's why you see log 2 (with the empty string) before log 1.

To get the selected item from the spinner, you can't return it directly from the `setupListWithAdapter` function because of this asynchronous behavior. Instead, you could use a callback function to handle the selected item.

Here's an example of how you could modify your function to use a callback:

```kotlin
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected) // Pass the selected item to the callback
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

Then, when you call `setupListWithAdapter`, you can provide a function to handle the selected item:

```kotlin
mySpinner.setupListWithAdapter(myList) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with selectedItem
}
```

This way, you can handle the selected item as soon as it's selected, even though this happens asynchronously.
