My goal is to know how this kind of text `$var1 = "my-name-is"` convert to camelCase`"myNameIs"`.
And this type `$var2 = "my_Name_is"` convert to PascalCase`"MyNameIs"`
Have no idea how to do it

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the hyphen as a delimiter.
2. Convert the first word to lowercase.
3. Convert the first letter of each subsequent word to uppercase.
4. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's some sample code in PHP:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode("-", $var1);
$camelCase = lcfirst(array_shift($words)) . implode("", array_map("ucfirst", $words));
echo $camelCase; // Outputs "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow similar steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the underscore as a delimiter.
2. Convert the first letter of each word to uppercase.
3. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's some sample code in PHP:

```
$var2 = "my_Name_is";
$words = explode("_", $var2);
$pascalCase = implode("", array_map("ucfirst", $words));
echo $pascalCase; // Outputs "MyNameIs"
```

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the delimiter `-`.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one.
3. Join the words back together without any delimiter.

Here's an example code snippet that does this:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode('-', $var1);
$camelCase = $words[0] . implode('', array_map('ucfirst', array_slice($words, 1)));
echo $camelCase; // Output: "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow similar steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the delimiter `_`.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word.
3. Join the words back together without any delimiter.

Here's an example code snippet that does this:

```
$var2 = "my_Name_is";
$words = explode('_', $var2);
$pascalCase = implode('', array_map('ucfirst', $words));
echo $pascalCase; // Output: "MyNameIs"
```

To convert `$var1` to camelCase, you can follow these steps:

1. Split the string into an array of words using the hyphen (`-`) as the delimiter.
2. Capitalize the first letter of each word except the first one.
3. Join the words back together without any spaces.

Here's an example code snippet in PHP:

```
$var1 = "my-name-is";
$words = explode('-', $var1);
$camelCase = $words[0];
for ($i = 1; $i < count($words); $i++) {
  $camelCase .= ucfirst($words[$i]);
}
echo $camelCase; // Output: "myNameIs"
```

To convert `$var2` to PascalCase, you can follow these steps:

}
echo $pascalCase; // Output: "MyNameIs"
