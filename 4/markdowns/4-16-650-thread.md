If I have a text file, C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt that has the following information:

```
collectionA.json
collectionB.json
collectionC.json
collectionD.json
```


I am wondering how, through Powershell, I am able to store each line in the text file as elements of an array such as..

```
array arrayFromFile = new Array;
foreach(line x in collection.txt)
{
    arrayFromFile.Add(x);
}
```


..with the end goal of doing the following:

```
foreach(string x in arrayFromFile)
{
    newman run x;
}
```


My apologies for the seemingly easy question - I have never dealt with Powershell before.

The `Get-Content` command returns each line from a text file as a separate string, so will give you an array (so long as you don't use the `-Raw` parameter; which causes all lines to be combined to a single string).

```
[string[]]$arrayFromFile = Get-Content -Path 'C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt'
```


In [his excellent answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52172027/361842), mklement0 gives a lot more detail on what's really going on when you call this command, as well as alternate approaches if you're concerned about performance over convenience.  Definitely worth a read if you're interested in learning more about the language rather than just solving this one off requirement.

To complement [JohnLBevan's helpful answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52170755/45375):
[Get-Content](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.management/get-content), as a [pipeline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_pipelines) (Note that a pipeline is involved even when invoking a cmdlet in the absence of the pipe symbol, `|`, the latter being required for chaining  commands).
In this case, the output objects are the individual  of the input text file.
, such as by  such as `$arrayFromFile` or by using the pipeline in the context of a larger  expression with `(...)`:
- `[object[]]`- 
However, , because PowerShell treats  (single values that aren't collections) the same as  (collections) in many contexts, such as in [foreach](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_Foreach) statements or when outputting a value to be enumerated to the pipeline, to be processed via the [ForEach-Object](https://learn.microsoft.com/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/foreach-object) cmdlet, for instance; therefore, the following commands work just fine, irrespective of how many lines the input file contains:
```
# OK - read all lines, then process them one by one in the loop.
# (No strict need to collect the Get-Content output in a variable first.)
foreach ($line in Get-Content C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt) {
  newman run $line
}

# Alternative, using the pipeline:
# Read line by line, and pass each through the pipeline, as it is being
# read, to the ForEach-Object cmdlet.
# Note the use of automatic variable $_ to refer to the line at hand.
Get-Content C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt |
  ForEach-Object { newman run $_ }
```

In order [@(...), the array-subexpression operator](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_operators), which wraps even single-object output in an array.
Therefore, the  is:
```
$arrayFromFile = @(Get-Content C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt)
```

[TheMadTechnician](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3245749/themadtechnician) points out that you `[array]``@(...)``[object[]]`:
```
# Equivalent of the command above that additionally locks in the variable date type.
[array] $arrayFromFile = Get-Content C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt
```

By using `[array] $arrayFromFile = ...` rather than `$arrayFromFile = [array] (...)`, variable `$arrayFromFile` becomes , which means that its data type is locked in (whereas by default PowerShell allows you to change the type of a variable anytime).
`[array]` is a command-independent alternative to the  cast used in John's answer, `[string[]]`; you may use the latter for enforcing use of a uniform type across the array's elements, but that is often not necessary in PowerShell
.
Regular PowerShell arrays are of type `[object[]]`, which allows mixing elements of different types, but any given element still has a specific type; e.g., even though the type of `$arrayFromFile` after the command above is `[object[]]`, the type of `$arrayFromFile[0]`, i.e. the 1st element, for instance, is `[string]` (assuming that the file contained at least 1 line; verify the type with `$arrayFromFile[0].GetType().Name`).

### Faster alternative: direct use of the .NET framework


Cmdlets and the pipeline offer high-level, potentially memory-throttling features that are expressive and convenient, but they can be .
When performance matters, direct use of .NET framework types is necessary, such as [[System.IO.File]](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.file) in this case.
```
$arrayFromFile = [IO.File]::ReadAllLines('C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt')
```

`System.`
- As in John's answer, this will return a `[string[]]` array.- :- Be careful with  paths, as .NET typically has a  current directory than PowerShell; to work around this, , in the simplest case with, e.g.,  `"$PWD/collection.txt"` and most robustly with
`"$((Get-Location -PSProvider FileSystem).ProviderPath)/collection.txt"`- , i.e.the system locale's legacy code page; . Use `Get-Encoding`'s `-Encoding` parameter or the `.ReadAllLines()` overload that accepts an encoding instance to specify the input file's character encoding explicitly.

`[string[]] $a = 'one', 'two'; $a[0] = 42``[int]``42`
