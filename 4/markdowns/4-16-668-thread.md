I have a file `file1` which ends with
`Success...` OR
`success...`
I want to `grep` for the word `success` in a way which is not case sensitive way.
I have written the following command but it is case sensitive
```
cat file1 | grep "success\.\.\."
```

How can i change it so that it `returns 0` with both `Success...` OR
`success...`

You can use the `-i` flag which makes your pattern case insensitive:

```
grep -iF "success..." file1
```


Also, there is no need for `cat`. `grep` takes a file with the syntax `grep <pattern> <file>`. I also used the `-F` flag to search for a fixed string to avoid escaping the ellipsis.

For me SQL=`echo $line | grep -iF "SQL"`;
IT works perfect

Since this bubbled up due to an edit being made, I'll add another method just for the fun of it.
```
grep '[Ss]uccess' file.txt
```

This uses the regular expression syntax for a character class of capital or lower 's'.
