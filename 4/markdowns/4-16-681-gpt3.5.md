Even though all my steps pass successfully , Gitlab CI shows this -
"Cleaning up file based variables
00:01
ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1"
and fails the job at the very end . Also interestingly , this only happens for my master branch . It runs successfully on other branches. Has anyone faced this issue and found a resolution ?

     # helm install the service
     fi
     done
    - echo "deployed"
```

It's hard to say exactly what the issue is without more information, but here are a few things you can try:

1. Check the logs: Look at the logs for the failed job to see if there are any error messages or other clues as to what might be causing the issue.

2. Check your GitLab CI configuration: Make sure that your GitLab CI configuration is correct and that there are no syntax errors or other issues.

3. Check your GitLab Runner: Make sure that your GitLab Runner is up-to-date and that it is configured correctly.

4. Try running the job locally: Try running the job locally on your machine to see if you can reproduce the issue. This can help you narrow down the problem and find a solution.

5. Contact GitLab support: If none of the above solutions work, you can contact GitLab support for further assistance. They may be able to help you troubleshoot the issue and find a solution.

It's difficult to determine the exact cause of the issue without more information about your GitLab CI configuration and the error message. However, here are a few suggestions that might help you resolve the issue:

1. Check the logs: The error message "ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1" is a generic error message that indicates that the job has failed. You should check the logs to see if there are any specific error messages that can help you identify the issue.

2. Check the GitLab CI configuration: Make sure that your GitLab CI configuration is correct and that it is not causing any issues. You can try running the job locally to see if it works as expected.

3. Check the master branch: Since the issue is only happening on the master branch, you should check if there are any differences between the master branch and the other branches. It's possible that there is a configuration issue or a problem with the code on the master branch.

4. Check the file-based variables: The error message "Cleaning up file based variables" indicates that there might be an issue with the file-based variables. Make sure that the file-based variables are set up correctly and that they are not causing any issues.

5. Contact GitLab support: If none of the above suggestions work, you can contact GitLab support for further assistance. They might be able to help you identify the issue and provide a solution.

It's difficult to determine the exact cause of the issue without more information, but here are some possible solutions:

1. Check if there are any file permissions issues on the master branch. Make sure that the user running the Gitlab CI job has the necessary permissions to access and modify the files.

2. Try running the Gitlab CI job with debug mode enabled to get more information about the error. You can do this by adding the following line to your Gitlab CI configuration file:

   ```
   variables:
     GIT_TRACE: "1"
   ```

   This will enable debug mode and print more detailed information about the error.

3. Check if there are any differences in the Gitlab CI configuration file between the master branch and other branches. Make sure that the configuration file is consistent across all branches.

4. Try running the Gitlab CI job on a different machine or environment to see if the issue is specific to the current environment.

5. If none of the above solutions work, try reaching out to the Gitlab support team for further assistance. They may be able to provide more specific guidance based on your setup and configuration.
