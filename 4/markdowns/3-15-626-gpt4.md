I have data in sheet 1. Normally I go to power query and do my transformations, then close, and load to an existing sheet 2.
I would like to automate this using VBA, where I can just run my power query automatically and populate the transformation to sheet 2.
Macro recorder doesn't seem to allow me to record the steps. And there isn't much online about doing this.
Trying some simpler code:
```
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

'Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly(query As WorkbookQuery, currentSheet As Worksheet)
    ' The usual VBA code to create ListObject with a Query Table
    ' The interface is not new, but looks how simple is the conneciton string of Power Query:
    ' "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name
     
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").value 'here is where my query from power query is. I put the text from power query avanced editor in another sheet cell.
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

Here is my issue when trying to load to new sheet manually.

The code you provided is trying to create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet using the Power Query connection string. However, it seems like there are some issues with the code.

Firstly, you're trying to get the query name from a cell value in Sheet6. This is not how you should reference a Power Query. Power Queries are stored in the WorkbookQuery collection of the workbook, not in cells. You should reference them by their name directly.

Secondly, you're trying to use the query name as part of the connection string and the SQL command text. This is not correct. The connection string should reference the workbook and the query name, but the SQL command text should just be a SQL query that the Power Query can execute.

Here's a corrected version of your code:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    Dim targetSheet As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable

    ' Get the query by its name
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("YourQueryName") ' replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your query

    ' Get the current sheet and the target sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("target")

    ' Delete existing query table if any
    If targetSheet.ListObjects.Count > 0 Then
        targetSheet.ListObjects(1).Delete
    End If

    ' Create a new QueryTable in the target sheet
    Set qt = targetSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=targetSheet.Range("$A$1")).QueryTable

    With qt
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have a Power Query named "YourQueryName" in your workbook. Replace "YourQueryName" with the actual name of your query. The code will create a new QueryTable in the "target" sheet using the Power Query as the data source.

Please note that Power Query and VBA are not fully integrated, and there are some limitations to what you can do with Power Query from VBA. For example, you can't modify the Power Query itself from VBA, you can only refresh it and load its results into a table.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The code you provided seems to be trying to create a QueryTable from a Power Query, but there are a few issues with it:

1. You're trying to assign a value to `query` and `currentSheet` without declaring them as variables. You should declare them at the start of your subroutine.

2. The `query` variable is supposed to be a `WorkbookQuery` object, but you're assigning it a value from a cell. This won't work because a `WorkbookQuery` object represents a Power Query in your workbook, not a string.

3. The `currentSheet` variable is supposed to be a `Worksheet` object, but you're assigning it the name of the active sheet. This won't work because the name of a sheet is a string, not a `Worksheet` object.

4. You're trying to use `query.Name` in your connection string and SQL command text, but `query` is not a `WorkbookQuery` object, so it doesn't have a `Name` property.

Unfortunately, Power Query is not fully exposed to VBA, so you can't create or modify Power Queries using VBA. However, you can refresh existing Power Queries using VBA. Here's an example:

```vba
Sub RefreshPowerQuery()
    Dim query As WorkbookQuery

    ' Get the first Power Query in the workbook
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries(1)

    ' Refresh the Power Query
    query.Refresh
End Sub
```

This will refresh the first Power Query in your workbook. If you have multiple Power Queries and you want to refresh a specific one, you can do so by replacing `1` with the name of your Power Query:

```vba
Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries("MyQuery")
```

After refreshing your Power Query, you can copy the data from the table it loads to and paste it into your target sheet:

```vba
Sub RefreshPowerQueryAndCopyData()
    Dim query As WorkbookQuery
    Dim sourceSheet As Worksheet, targetSheet As Worksheet
    Dim sourceRange As Range, targetRange As Range

    ' Get the first Power Query in the workbook
    Set query = ThisWorkbook.Queries(1)

    ' Refresh the Power Query
    query.Refresh

    ' Set the source and target sheets
    Set sourceSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    Set targetSheet = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2")

    ' Set the source range (the table the Power Query loads to)
    Set sourceRange = sourceSheet.ListObjects(1).Range

    ' Set the target range (the top-left cell where you want to paste the data)
    Set targetRange = targetSheet.Range("A1")

    ' Copy the data from the source range to the target range
    sourceRange.Copy Destination:=targetRange
End Sub
```

This will copy the entire table, including the headers. If you don't want to copy the headers, you can adjust the source range like this:

```vba
Set sourceRange = sourceSheet.ListObjects(1).DataBodyRange
```

This will only copy the data rows, not the headers.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The code you provided seems to be trying to create a new query table in the active sheet using the Power Query query stored in cell A1 of Sheet6. However, there are a few issues with the code:

1. You are trying to use the `query` and `currentSheet` as objects, but you are assigning them string values. You need to declare them as appropriate object types (like `Range` or `Worksheet`) and set them accordingly.

2. The `query` variable is being assigned the value of a cell, but later in the code you are trying to use it as if it were a `WorkbookQuery` object. If you want to use the text from the Power Query Advanced Editor, you will need to create a new `WorkbookQuery` object and set its `Formula` property to the text from the cell.

3. The `Location` property in the connection string should be the name of the query, not the name of the sheet or range where the query text is stored.

4. The `Destination` property in the `ListObjects.Add` method should be a `Range` object that represents the top-left cell where you want the query results to be placed.

Here is a revised version of your code that should work:

```vba
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

    Dim query As String
    Dim currentSheet As Worksheet
    Dim destination As Range
    Dim queryTable As QueryTable

    ' Get the query text from Sheet6
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").Value

    ' Set the current sheet
    Set currentSheet = ActiveSheet

    ' Set the destination range
    Set destination = Sheets("Sheet2").Range("A1")

    ' Create a new query table in the current sheet
    Set queryTable = currentSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query _
        , Destination:=destination).QueryTable

    ' Set the properties of the query table
    With queryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With

End Sub
```

Please note that this code assumes that the text in cell A1 of Sheet6 is a valid Power Query query. If it's not, you will need to modify the code to create a valid `WorkbookQuery` object.
