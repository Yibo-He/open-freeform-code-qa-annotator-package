If I have a text file, C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt that has the following information:

```
collectionA.json
collectionB.json
collectionC.json
collectionD.json
```


I am wondering how, through Powershell, I am able to store each line in the text file as elements of an array such as..

```
array arrayFromFile = new Array;
foreach(line x in collection.txt)
{
    arrayFromFile.Add(x);
}
```


..with the end goal of doing the following:

```
foreach(string x in arrayFromFile)
{
    newman run x;
}
```


My apologies for the seemingly easy question - I have never dealt with Powershell before.

No problem at all! Here's how you can achieve this in PowerShell:

```
# Read the contents of the file into an array
$arrayFromFile = Get-Content -Path "C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt"

# Loop through the array and run newman for each file
foreach ($file in $arrayFromFile) {
    newman run $file
}
```

The `Get-Content` cmdlet reads the contents of the file and returns an array of strings, with each line of the file being an element in the array. We then loop through the array using a `foreach` loop and run `newman` for each file.

Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

No problem at all! Here's how you can achieve this in PowerShell:

```
# Read the contents of the file into an array
$arrayFromFile = Get-Content -Path "C:\USER\Documents\Collections\collection.txt"

# Loop through the array and run the newman command for each file
foreach ($file in $arrayFromFile) {
    newman run $file
}
```

The `Get-Content` cmdlet is used to read the contents of the file and store each line as an element in the `$arrayFromFile` array. Then, the `foreach` loop is used to iterate through each element in the array and run the `newman` command with the file name as an argument.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
