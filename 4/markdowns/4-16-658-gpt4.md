I'm trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019 (Docker Desktop does not work here, my VPS does not support Hyper-V).
I run this in PowerShell (all in Administrator mode)
`docker run -it --isolation=process mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t`
Then I get error:
> docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect.: Post http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.24/containers/create: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified.
See 'docker run --help'.
I ran command `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon`, as suggested here: [Docker cannot start on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40459280/docker-cannot-start-on-windows)
However, `DockerCli.exe` does not exist in a clean Docker install:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCcAr.png)
As [suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179462/where-do-i-find-dockercli-exe) I tried copying the file `DockerCli.exe` from my local Windows 10 Docker Desktop installation and reran, but then I get:
> Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Docker.Core, Version=3.0.0.50646, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Run(IReadOnlyCollection`1 args)
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Main(String[] args)
Regardless, copying files from Docker Desktop does not feel like the right approach.
I then ran `dockerd` in PowerShell since that's the only other executable in that folder:

Since I'm a newbie, I'm not sure if I just started a container and if so, which one, I just see `start.`, but no idea where that comes from or how I can configure it.

Based on Peter Wishart's suggestion I tried `uninstall-Package -Name docker`, but then I get
```
uninstall-Package : No package found for 'docker'. At line:1 char:1
+ uninstall-Package -Name docker

   , Exception

```

Here's the full code of what I tried:

It seems like you're having trouble with Docker on Windows Server 2019. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Docker Version**: Ensure that you have the correct version of Docker installed. Docker Desktop is not supported on Windows Server. You should be using Docker Enterprise Edition for Windows Server 2019.

2. **Reinstall Docker**: If you have the wrong version of Docker installed, you will need to uninstall it and then reinstall the correct version. Here are the steps to do that:

   - Uninstall Docker:
     ```
     Uninstall-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
     ```
   - Install Docker:
     ```
     Install-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
     ```
   - Restart the Docker service:
     ```
     Restart-Service Docker
     ```

3. **Check Docker Service**: Ensure that the Docker service is running. You can check this by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```
   Get-Service Docker
   ```
   If the Docker service is not running, you can start it with the following command:
   ```
   Start-Service Docker
   ```

4. **Check Docker Configuration**: Ensure that Docker is configured to run in process isolation mode. You can check this by running the following command in PowerShell:
   ```
   docker info
   ```
   Look for the "Isolation" line in the output. If it's not set to "process", you can set it by modifying the Docker configuration file.

5. **Check Docker Images**: Ensure that you are using Windows-based Docker images. Linux-based images will not work with process isolation on Windows Server.

If you're still having trouble after trying these steps, please provide more information about your setup and the exact error messages you're seeing.

It seems like you are having trouble with Docker on Windows Server 2019. Here are some steps to help you troubleshoot and resolve the issue:

1. **Check Docker Version**: First, check the Docker version installed on your system. You can do this by running `docker version` in your PowerShell. This will display the version of Docker you are running. Ensure that you are running a version that supports process isolation.

2. **Check Docker Service**: Ensure that the Docker service is running. You can check this by running `Get-Service docker` in your PowerShell. If the service is not running, you can start it by running `Start-Service docker`.

3. **Reinstall Docker**: If the Docker service is running and you are still facing issues, you may need to reinstall Docker. You can uninstall Docker by running `Uninstall-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force` and then reinstall it by running `Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider`.

4. **Check Docker Configuration**: If you are still facing issues after reinstalling Docker, you may need to check your Docker configuration. You can do this by running `docker info` in your PowerShell. This will display information about your Docker configuration. Look for any errors or warnings that may indicate what is causing the issue.

5. **Check Docker Logs**: If you are still unable to resolve the issue, you may need to check the Docker logs for any errors or warnings. You can do this by running `Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source Docker -After (Get-Date).AddHours(-1)` in your PowerShell. This will display the Docker logs for the past hour.

Remember to run all these commands in an elevated PowerShell prompt (Run as Administrator). If you are still facing issues after trying these steps, you may need to reach out to Docker support for further assistance.

The error message you're seeing is indicating that the Docker daemon is not running. The Docker daemon is the background service running on the host that manages building, running and distributing Docker containers.

Here are some steps you can try:

1. **Check if Docker is running:** You can check if Docker is running by executing the following command in PowerShell:

    ```powershell
    Get-Service Docker
    ```
    If Docker is not running, you can start it with the following command:

    ```powershell
    Start-Service Docker
    ```

2. **Check Docker version:** Make sure you have the correct version of Docker installed. Docker Desktop is not supported on Windows Server. You should install Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) for Windows Server. You can download it from the Docker Store.

3. **Reinstall Docker:** If Docker is still not working, you may need to reinstall it. Here are the steps to do so:

    - Uninstall Docker:

        ```powershell
        Uninstall-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
        ```

    - Install Docker:

        ```powershell
        Install-Package -Name Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
        ```

    - Start Docker:

        ```powershell
        Start-Service Docker
        ```

4. **Check Docker daemon configuration:** If Docker is still not working, you may need to check the Docker daemon configuration. The configuration file is located at `C:\ProgramData\Docker\config\daemon.json`. Make sure the file is correctly configured. You can find more information about the Docker daemon configuration in the Docker documentation.

5. **Check Docker logs:** If Docker is still not working, you can check the Docker logs for any error messages. The logs are located at `C:\ProgramData\Docker\logs\daemon.log`.

6. **Contact Docker support:** If you're still having issues, you may need to contact Docker support. They can help you troubleshoot the issue and provide further assistance.
