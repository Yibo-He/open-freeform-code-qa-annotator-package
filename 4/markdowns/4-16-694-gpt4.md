I am trying to get language code from pages by curl
I wrote below and work...
```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

but sometimes code is different like
```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

they wrote like
```
<html dir="rtl" lang="he-IL">
```

I just need to get `he-IL`
If is there any other way, I would appreciate it...

You can use a more specific regular expression to extract the language code. Here's an example using `grep` with Perl-compatible regular expressions (`-P`), and `-o` to print only the matched parts:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]*'
```

This command will look for the string `lang="`, then capture everything until the next `"`. The `(?<=lang=")` part is a positive lookbehind assertion, meaning it requires `lang="` to be there, but doesn't include it in the match.

This command should work for any webpage and will return the language code regardless of its position in the `<html>` tag.

The issue you're facing is due to the inconsistent placement of the `lang` attribute in the HTML tag. In some cases, it might be the third attribute, while in others, it might be the second, fourth, etc. 

A more reliable way to extract the language code would be to use a regular expression that specifically targets the `lang` attribute, regardless of its position in the tag. 

Here's how you can do it using `grep` with a Perl-compatible regular expression (`-P`):

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]*'
```

This command will output the value of the `lang` attribute, regardless of its position in the tag. 

Here's how it works:

- `-o` tells `grep` to only output the part of the line that matches the pattern.
- `-P` enables Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions.
- `(?<=lang=")` is a positive lookbehind assertion that matches the `lang="` string but doesn't include it in the output.
- `[^"]*` matches any number of characters that are not a double quote (`"`), which effectively captures the value of the `lang` attribute.

Please note that `-P` option might not be available in all `grep` versions. If it's not available in your version, you might need to use a different tool that supports Perl-Compatible Regular Expressions, such as `perl` or `pcregrep`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're facing is due to the different structure of the HTML in different pages. The `cut` command you're using is dependent on the exact position of the `lang` attribute in the HTML tag, which can vary.

A more robust way to extract the language code would be to use a tool that can parse the HTML and extract the attribute value directly. For example, you can use `awk` to do this:

```bash
curl -Ls stick-it.app | awk -F 'lang="' '{print $2}' | awk -F '"' '{print $1}'
```

This command works by first splitting the input on the `lang="` string, and then splitting the result on the `"` character. This will give you the value of the `lang` attribute regardless of its position in the tag.

However, please note that this will still only give you the value of the first `lang` attribute it finds. If there are multiple `lang` attributes in the page, you might need a more complex solution.
