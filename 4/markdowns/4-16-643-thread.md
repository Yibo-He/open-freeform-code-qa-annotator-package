I know [how to change the Terminal Window title](https://askubuntu.com/questions/22413/how-to-change-gnome-terminal-title).  What I am trying to find out is how to make `bash` not `zsh` write out the currently running process so if I say do
```
$ ls -lF
```

I would get something like this for the title
```
/home/me/curerntFolder (ls -lF)
```

[Getting the last executed command](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69624234/get-last-executed-command-in-bash) would be too late since the command has executed already, so it won't set the title with the command that was executed.

: my previous answer (below) displays the  command in the title bar.
Ignoring everything from my previous answer and starting from scratch:
```
trap 'echo -ne "\033]0;${PWD}: (${BASH_COMMAND})\007"' DEBUG
```

Running the following at the command prompt:
```
$ sleep 10
```

The window title bar changes to `/my/current/directory: (sleep 10)`  the `sleep 10` is running.
Running either of these:
```
$ sleep 1; sleep 2; sleep 3
$ { sleep 1; sleep2; sleep 3; }
```

The title bar changes as each `sleep` command is invoked.
Running this:
```
$ ( sleep 1; sleep 2; sleep 3 )
```

The title bar does not change (the `trap` does not apply within a subprocess call).
One last one:
```
$ echo $(sleep 3; echo abc)
```

The title bar displays `(echo $sleep 3; echo abc))`.

Adding to this [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69624336):
```
store_command() {
  declare -g last_command current_command
  last_command=$current_command
  current_command=$BASH_COMMAND
  return 0
}
trap store_command DEBUG

PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${PWD}: (${last_command})\007"'
```

In addition to @markp-fuso's answer, here's how I did it to make it work with Starship.
```
function set_win_title() {
    local cmd=" ($@)"
    if [[ "$cmd" == " (starship_precmd)" || "$cmd" == " ()" ]]
    then
      cmd=""
    fi
    if [[ $PWD == $HOME ]]
    then
      if [[ $SSH_TTY ]]
      then
        echo -ne "\033]0; ️ @ $HOSTNAME ~$cmd\a" < /dev/null
      else
        echo -ne "\033]0;  ~$cmd\a" < /dev/null
      fi
    else
      BASEPWD=$(basename "$PWD")
      if [[ $SSH_TTY ]]
      then
        echo -ne "\033]0; ️ $BASEPWD @ $HOSTNAME $cmd\a" < /dev/null
      else
        echo -ne "\033]0;  $BASEPWD $cmd\a" < /dev/null
      fi
    fi

  }
  starship_precmd_user_func="set_win_title"
  eval "$(starship init bash)"
  trap "$(trap -p DEBUG |  awk -F"'" '{print $2}');set_win_title \${BASH_COMMAND}" DEBUG
```

Note this differs from the [Custom pre-prompt and pre-execution Commands in Bash instructions](https://starship.rs/advanced-config/#custom-pre-prompt-and-pre-execution-commands-in-bash) in that the trap is set  `starship init`.  Which I have noted in [a bug](https://github.com/starship/starship/issues/3749).

You can combine setting the window title with setting the prompt.
Here's an example using [bash](/questions/tagged/bash)s `PROMPT_COMMAND`:
```
tputps () {
    echo -n '\['
    tput "$@"
    echo -n '\]'
}

prompt_builder () {
    # Window title - operating system command (OSC) ESC + ]
    echo -ne '\033]0;'"${USER}@${HOSTNAME}:$(dirs)"'\a' >&2

    # username, green
    tputps setaf 2
    echo -n '\u'

    # directory, orange
    tputps setaf 208
    echo -n ' \w'
    tputps sgr0 0
}

prompt_cmd () {
    PS1="$(prompt_builder) \$ "
}

export PROMPT_COMMAND=prompt_cmd
```

For  Adding following function in  file


1. Open bashrc file


> vi ~/.bashrc

1. Write a function in bashrc file function set-title() {
   if [[ -z "$ORIG" ]]; then
     ORIG=$PS1
   fi
   TITLE="\[\e]2;$*\a\]"
   PS1=${ORIG}${TITLE}
 }

1. save the file


> source ~/.bashrc

1. call function


> set-title "tab1"

The easiest way to change the title of the terminal I could think of is to use echo in shell script
```
echo "\033]0;Your title \007"
```

And to change open a new tab with new title name is
```
meta-terminal--tab-t"Your title"
```
