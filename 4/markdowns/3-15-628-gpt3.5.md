Im using [VBA code to create multiple selection drop down list](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261013/multiple-selection-dropdown-list-in-excel). The code will make each drop down list in target cell become multuple selection list with function:
`If Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation) Is Nothing Then GoTo Exitsub`
The source of drop down list in target cell is `=indirect(b14)`, and b14 is another drop down list (single selection). Now if b14's value will become list1, Id like to make my target's cell list become multiple selection list. In any other case I want it work in normal excel way. I've tried to precache the list source with `if Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1) = "=list1" then`
but I get mismatch error for `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)`.
How can I do it?
EDIT:
There are some example screenshots from my worksheet, not to misunderstand it's construction.

A1:A5 named range list1, B1:B5 named range list2, B14 data validation list =list1

D14 data validation list with =INDIRECT(B14) formula

To achieve your goal, you can modify the code to check the value of cell B14 and if it is "list1", then make the target cell a multiple selection list. Here's the modified code:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim rngDV As Range
    Dim oldVal As String
    Dim newVal As String
    
    On Error Resume Next
    
    If Target.Count > 1 Then GoTo exitsub
    
    Set rngDV = Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation)
    
    If rngDV Is Nothing Then GoTo exitsub
    
    If Intersect(Target, Range("B14")) Is Nothing Then GoTo exitsub
    
    If Target.Value = "list1" Then
        'make the target cell a multiple selection list
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=list1"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
    Else
        'make the target cell a single selection list
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=INDIRECT(B14)"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
    End If
    
exitsub:
    Application.EnableEvents = True
    On Error GoTo 0
End Sub
```

In this code, we first check if the changed cell has data validation applied to it. If it does, we check if the changed cell is B14. If it is, we check the value of B14. If it is "list1", we make the target cell a multiple selection list, otherwise, we make it a single selection list.

Note that in the code, we are deleting the existing validation and adding a new one with the appropriate formula. This is necessary because we cannot modify the existing validation formula directly.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

To achieve your desired result, you can modify the code as follows:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim rngDV As Range
    Dim oldVal As String
    Dim newVal As String
    
    On Error Resume Next
    
    If Target.Count > 1 Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    Set rngDV = Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation)
    
    If rngDV Is Nothing Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    If Not Intersect(Target, Range("B14")) Is Nothing Then
        If Target.Value = "list1" Then
            Target.Offset(1, 0).ClearContents
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.Delete
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.Add xlValidateList, xlValidAlertStop, xlBetween, "=list1"
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.InCellDropdown = True
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Validation.ShowError = False
            Target.Offset(1, 0).Select
            Exit Sub
        End If
    End If
    
    Application.EnableEvents = False
    newVal = Target.Value
    
    Application.Undo
    oldVal = Target.Value
    Target.Value = newVal
    
    If Target.Column = 4 And Target.Row > 13 Then
        If Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1) = "=list1" Then
            Target.Validation.Delete
            Target.Validation.Add xlValidateList, xlValidAlertStop, xlBetween, "=list1"
            Target.Validation.InCellDropdown = True
            Target.Validation.ShowError = False
            Target.Select
            Target.Value = oldVal
        End If
    End If
    
    Application.EnableEvents = True
    
    Exitsub:
        Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, we first check if the changed cell is B14 and its value is "list1". If it is, we clear the cell below it (D15 in your example), delete its validation, and add a new validation with the source "=list1" and InCellDropdown set to True. This will make the cell a multiple selection drop-down list.

If the changed cell is not B14 or its value is not "list1", we proceed with the rest of the code as before. However, we add an additional check to see if the validation formula of the changed cell is "=list1". If it is, we delete its validation, add a new validation with the source "=list1" and InCellDropdown set to True, and restore its old value. This will make the cell a multiple selection drop-down list.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To achieve your desired functionality, you can modify the code as follows:

1. Check if the value of cell B14 is "list1".
2. If it is "list1", then change the validation formula of the target cell to allow multiple selections.
3. If it is not "list1", then change the validation formula of the target cell to allow single selection.

Here is the modified code:

```
Private Sub Worksheet_Change(ByVal Target As Range)
    Dim rngDV As Range
    Dim oldVal As String
    Dim newVal As String
    
    On Error Resume Next
    
    If Target.Count > 1 Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    If Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation) Is Nothing Then GoTo Exitsub
    
    Application.EnableEvents = False
    
    newVal = Target.Value
    
    Application.Undo
    
    oldVal = Target.Value
    
    Target.Value = newVal
    
    If Evaluate("=B14") = "list1" Then
        Set rngDV = Range("A1:A5")
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=INDIRECT(B14)"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
        rngDV.Select
    Else
        With Target.Validation
            .Delete
            .Add Type:=xlValidateList, AlertStyle:=xlValidAlertStop, _
                 Formula1:="=INDIRECT(B14)"
            .IgnoreBlank = True
            .InCellDropdown = True
            .InputTitle = ""
            .ErrorTitle = ""
            .InputMessage = ""
            .ErrorMessage = ""
            .ShowInput = True
            .ShowError = True
        End With
    End If
    
Exitsub:
    Application.EnableEvents = True
End Sub
```

In this code, we first check if the value of cell B14 is "list1" using `Evaluate("=B14") = "list1"`. If it is, then we set the validation formula of the target cell to allow multiple selections using `Type:=xlValidateList` and `Formula1:="=INDIRECT(B14)"`. If it is not, then we set the validation formula of the target cell to allow single selection using the same code.

Note that we have removed the `If Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1) = "=list1" then` line as it is not required in this modified code.
