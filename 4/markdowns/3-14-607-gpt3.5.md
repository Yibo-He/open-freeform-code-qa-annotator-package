I have a textfield with a send button that's a systemImage arrow. I want the foreground color of the image to change depending on whether the textField is empty or not. (I.e. the button is gray, and it is disabled if the textfield is empty. It's blue if the count of the textfield text is > 1).
I have a workaround that's not perfect:
```
if chatMessageIsValid {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
    }
} else {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(Color.gray)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
    }
}
```

This almost works, and it does change the color of the image if the text is > 1 in length. However, due to the change in state you're kicked out of editing the textfield after one character is typed, and you'll need to select the textfield again to continue typing. Is there a better way to do this with the .disabled modifier?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

Yes, there is a better way to achieve this behavior without using the `disabled` modifier. You can use the `@State` property wrapper to keep track of whether the text field is empty or not, and then use a computed property to set the foreground color of the image based on the state.

Here's an example implementation:

```
@State private var chatMessage: String = ""

private var chatMessageIsValid: Bool {
    !chatMessage.isEmpty
}

private var sendButtonForegroundColor: Color {
    chatMessageIsValid ? .blue : .gray
}

var body: some View {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(sendButtonForegroundColor)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }
    }
}
```

In this implementation, the `chatMessageIsValid` property is a computed property that returns `true` if the `chatMessage` string is not empty. The `sendButtonForegroundColor` property is also a computed property that returns `.blue` if `chatMessageIsValid` is `true`, and `.gray` otherwise.

By using this approach, the foreground color of the image will update automatically as the user types in the text field, without any need to use the `disabled` modifier.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

Yes, there is a better way to achieve this without using the `disabled` modifier. You can use a `@State` variable to keep track of whether the text field is empty or not, and then use a `computed property` to set the foreground color of the image based on the value of the `@State` variable.

Here's an example code snippet that demonstrates this approach:

```
@State private var chatMessage: String = ""

private var chatMessageIsValid: Bool {
    !chatMessage.isEmpty
}

private var sendButtonColor: Color {
    chatMessageIsValid ? .blue : .gray
}

var body: some View {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField("Reply", text: $chatMessage)
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(sendButtonColor)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, we use the `chatMessageIsValid` computed property to check whether the text field is empty or not. We then use the `sendButtonColor` computed property to set the foreground color of the image based on the value of `chatMessageIsValid`. This way, the color of the image will change dynamically as the user types in the text field, without affecting the editing experience.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

Yes, there is a better way to achieve this without changing the state of the view. You can use a computed property to determine the foreground color of the image based on the length of the text in the textfield. Here's an example:

```
var sendButtonColor: Color {
    if chatMessage.count > 1 {
        return Color.blue
    } else {
        return Color.gray
    }
}

var body: some View {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(sendButtonColor)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }.disabled(chatMessage.isEmpty)
    }
}
```

In this example, the `sendButtonColor` property returns blue if the length of the text in the textfield is greater than 1, and gray otherwise. The `foregroundColor` of the image is then set to this computed property. The `disabled` modifier is set to `chatMessage.isEmpty` to disable the button if the textfield is empty. This way, the state of the view is not changed and you can continue editing the textfield without interruption.
