```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi '$searchT') ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT' && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT')

else echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

How do I make the script run if the `if statement` is true. when i run the script the script will output the `else` statement. because there is no value to compare with the grep command.

Here's another way to cache the results: [mapfile](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-mapfile) consumes its stdin into an array, each line is an array element.
```
mapfile -t results < <(grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt)
num=${#results[@]}

if ((num == 0)); then
    echo "no match found"
else
    echo "found $num matches"
    printf "%s\n" "${results[@]}"
fi
```

It's not precisely clear what you are trying to match, but remember that `if` takes a command and evaluates its returns value.  `grep`  succeeds if it matches, and fails if it does not.  So you probably just want to do:
```
if grep -q -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then
   ...
fi
```

Note that you should use double quotes so that "$searchT" is expanded and its value is passed as the argument to grep, and there is no need for `cat`.

```
#!/bin/bash

if [ $((n=$(grep -wic "$searchT" test.txt))) -ge 0 ]; then
    echo "found ${n}"
else
    echo "not found ${n}"
fi
```

modified based on comments:
```
#!/bin/bash

if n=$(grep -wic "$searchT" test.txt); then
    echo "found ${n}"
else
    echo "not found ${n}"
fi
```
