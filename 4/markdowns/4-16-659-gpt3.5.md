----------

I am trying to filter my json file using bash, which file could be something like:
```
{
    "key1": [],
    "key2":["first_value","second_value"]
}
```

In case I would like to fetch key1 and key2 I got I can do something like:
```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1")'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

The output of the previous is:
```
Output:

Item : []
```

This prevents any issues in the case my file hasn't such key and I want to verify that.
How can I verify that values is empty, referred to my example?
I want to avoid any iteration on empty values.
Is there any way to verify the existing key with jq, that should not be empty?
The goal I would like to achieve is something like 
```
key2:
- first_value
- second_value
```

in case of key, since it is empty I don't want to have any results

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To check if a key exists and is not empty, you can use the `length` function in jq. Here's an example:

```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1") and (.key1 | length > 0)'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

This will only enter the if statement if "key1" exists and is not empty. The `length` function returns the number of elements in an array or the number of characters in a string, so if it returns 0, the array or string is empty.

To achieve the output you want, you can use the `join` function to concatenate the array elements with a separator, and then use the `printf` function to format the output as a list. Here's an example:

```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key2") and (.key2 | length > 0)'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key2 | join(\"\\n\")" "$my_json")

  printf "key2:\n"
  printf -- "- %s\n" $values
fi
```

This will only enter the if statement if "key2" exists and is not empty. The `join` function concatenates the array elements with a newline separator, and the `printf` function formats the output as a list with each element preceded by a hyphen.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To check if a key exists and is not empty in your JSON file, you can use the following command:
```
if [[ $(jq -r '.key1 | length' "$my_json") -gt 0 ]]; then
  values=$(jq -r '.key1[]' "$my_json")
  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```
This command checks if the length of the array associated with "key1" is greater than 0. If it is, then it iterates over the array and prints each item.

To achieve the desired output of key-value pairs that are not empty, you can use the following command:
```
jq 'to_entries | map(select(.value | length > 0)) | from_entries' "$my_json"
```
This command converts the JSON object to an array of key-value pairs using `to_entries`, filters out the pairs with empty values using `map(select(.value | length > 0))`, and then converts the filtered array back to a JSON object using `from_entries`. This will give you only the key-value pairs that are not empty.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To check if the value of a key is empty, you can use the `length` filter in jq. Here's an example:

```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1")'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1" "$my_json")

  if [[ $(echo "$values" | jq 'length') -gt 0 ]]; then
    for item in $values
    do
      echo "Item : $item"
    done
  fi
fi
```

This checks if the length of the `values` array is greater than 0 before iterating over it.

To get the output you want, you can use the `join` and `map` filters in jq. Here's an example:

```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key2")'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key2" "$my_json")

  if [[ $(echo "$values" | jq 'length') -gt 0 ]]; then
    echo "key2:"
    echo "$values" | jq -r 'map("- " + .) | join("\n")'
  fi
fi
```

This will output:

```
key2:
- first_value
- second_value
```

if the `key2` key exists and has non-empty values. If the `key2` key is empty or doesn't exist, nothing will be output.
