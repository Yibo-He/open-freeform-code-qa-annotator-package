I need to extract data from text file into Excel file. I once asked at [Vbscript extract data from Text File into Excel](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66252338/vbscript-extract-data-from-text-file-into-excel)
But after trying for few weeks and still no success so I use vba instead.
Here what i have:
```
Sub ExtractData()

Dim filename As String, nextrow As Long, MyFolder As String
Dim MyFile As String, text As String, textline As String, filedate As String
Dim filenum As Integer
Dim idx%

MyFolder = "D:\Automation\VSWR\"
MyFile = Dir(MyFolder & "VSWR W51.txt")

nextrow = ActiveSheet.Cells(Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row + 1

Cells(1, 1).Value = "eNodeBName"
Cells(1, 2).Value = "Time"
Cells(1, 3).Value = "MML SN"
Cells(1, 4).Value = "MML Command"
Cells(1, 5).Value = "Retcode"
Cells(1, 6).Value = "Explain_info"
Cells(1, 7).Value = "Cabinet No."
Cells(1, 8).Value = "Subrack No."
Cells(1, 9).Value = "Slot No."
Cells(1, 10).Value = "TX Channel No."
Cells(1, 11).Value = "VSWR(0.01)"
'Columns(1).EntireColumn.AutoFit

Do While MyFile <> ""

Open (MyFolder & MyFile) For Input As #1

    Do Until EOF(1)
        Line Input #1, textline 'read a line
        
        idx = InStr(textline, "NE")
        If idx > 0 Then
            'ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "A").Value = Mid(textline, idx + 5)
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "A").Value = Mid(textline, filenum + 5)
        End If

        idx = InStr(textline, "Report")
        If idx > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "B").Value = Right(textline, filenum + 19)
        End If
        
        idx = InStr(textline, "O&M")
        If idx > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "C").Value = ("O&M" & Mid(textline, filenum + 4))
        End If
        
        
        idx = InStr(textline, "MML Session")
        If idx > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "D").Value = "DSP VSWR:;"
        End If
        
        
        idx = InStr(textline, "RETCODE")
        If idx > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "E").Value = "0"
        End If
           
        idx = InStr(textline, "RETCODE")
        If idx > 0 Then
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "F").Value = Mid(textline, filenum + 12)

            'nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
        End If
                 
        idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
        If idx > 0 Then
        
            Line Input #1, textline
            Line Input #1, textline
            ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = Mid(textline, filenum + 1)
            
            nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
        End If
    Loop  
Close #1
MyFile = Dir()

Loop
End Sub
```

Almost successful but the only problem is i can't seem to figure out how to make this line split the data into 5 separate columns.
```
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
        
Line Input #1, textline
Line Input #1, textline
ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = Mid(textline, filenum + 1)
            
nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If`
```

And my desired output should be like this [Output](https://i.stack.imgur.com/r4sAD.png)
Thanks in advance and really appreciate.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

Based on your code and the images you provided, it seems like you are trying to split a line of text into multiple columns in Excel. The line of text you are trying to split is in the format of "Cabinet No. X, Subrack No. Y, Slot No. Z, TX Channel No. A, VSWR(0.01) B".

You can use the `Split` function in VBA to split a string into an array, and then assign each element of the array to a different cell in Excel. Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim parts() As String
    parts = Split(textline, ",") 'split the line into an array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = Trim$(Split(parts(0), ".")(1)) 'Cabinet No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = Trim$(Split(parts(1), ".")(1)) 'Subrack No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = Trim$(Split(parts(2), ".")(1)) 'Slot No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = Trim$(Split(parts(3), ".")(1)) 'TX Channel No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = Trim$(Split(parts(4), " ")(1)) 'VSWR(0.01)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code splits the line of text into an array `parts` using the comma as a delimiter. Then, for each part, it splits again using the period as a delimiter and takes the second element (index 1), which is the value you want. The `Trim$` function is used to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the values.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

Based on your code and the sample input and output you provided, it seems like you want to split the line that contains the values for "Cabinet No.", "Subrack No.", "Slot No.", "TX Channel No.", and "VSWR(0.01)" into separate columns in Excel.

To do this, you can use the `Split` function in VBA, which splits a string into a one-dimensional array based on a delimiter. In your case, the delimiter is a space (" ").

Here is how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim parts() As String
    parts = Split(textline, " ") 'split the line into parts
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = parts(0) 'Cabinet No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = parts(1) 'Subrack No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = parts(2) 'Slot No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = parts(3) 'TX Channel No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = parts(4) 'VSWR(0.01)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that each value is separated by a single space. If there are multiple spaces, you might need to add some additional logic to handle that.

Please note that this is a simple solution and may not work perfectly if your data is not consistently formatted. For example, if one of the values contains a space, it will be split into two parts. If this is the case, you may need a more complex solution, such as using a regular expression to match the values.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Based on your code and the sample input, it seems like you're trying to split a line of text into separate columns in Excel. The line of text you're trying to split looks like this:

```
Cabinet No.  Subrack No.  Slot No.  TX Channel No.  VSWR(0.01)
```

You can use the `Split` function in VBA to split a string into an array, and then assign the elements of the array to the appropriate cells. Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
idx = InStr(textline, "Cabinet No.")
If idx > 0 Then
    Line Input #1, textline
    Line Input #1, textline
    Dim parts() As String
    parts = Split(textline, "  ") 'split the line into an array
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "G").Value = parts(0) 'Cabinet No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "H").Value = parts(1) 'Subrack No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "I").Value = parts(2) 'Slot No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "J").Value = parts(3) 'TX Channel No.
    ActiveSheet.Cells(nextrow, "K").Value = parts(4) 'VSWR(0.01)
    nextrow = nextrow + 1 'now move to next row
End If
```

This code assumes that the values in the line are separated by two spaces. If they're separated by a different number of spaces or a different character, you'll need to adjust the argument to the `Split` function accordingly.

Also, please note that the array `parts` is zero-based, so `parts(0)` is the first element, `parts(1)` is the second, and so on.
