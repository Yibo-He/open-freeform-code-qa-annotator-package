After updating to the latest version of Xcode at the moment (version 10.0) the project is unable to build because it found some errors regarding some "Command CompileSwift failed with a nonzero exit code" error.

They appear in most of the Pods (I use CocoaPods) I use inside my project.
I have tried updating the pod version and the pods to the latest version available, but the problem is still there.
I have searched a lot through the web and there is very little information regarding this issue.

This error message usually indicates that there is a problem with the Swift code in your project or one of the pods. Here are some steps you can take to try and resolve the issue:

1. Clean your project: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all the build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Check for any syntax errors: Go through your code and make sure there are no syntax errors or typos. If you're using a pod, check the pod's documentation to make sure you're using it correctly.

3. Check for any missing dependencies: Make sure all the required dependencies are installed and up-to-date. You can do this by running "pod install" in the terminal.

4. Check for any conflicting dependencies: Make sure there are no conflicting dependencies between your project and the pods you're using. You can use the "pod dependency" command to see a list of all the dependencies and their versions.

5. Try updating Xcode: If none of the above steps work, try updating Xcode to the latest version. This may fix any compatibility issues with the pods you're using.

If none of these steps work, you may need to reach out to the developers of the pods you're using for further assistance.

This error can be caused by a number of different issues, so it's important to try a few different solutions to see if any of them work for you.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. Clean your project: In Xcode, go to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will delete all of the build files for your project and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

2. Update your pods: Make sure you have the latest version of CocoaPods installed (you can check by running `pod --version` in your terminal). Then, run `pod update` to update all of your pods to their latest versions.

3. Check for any pod conflicts: Sometimes, two or more pods can have conflicting dependencies. You can use a tool like `pod outdated` to check for any outdated or conflicting pods in your project.

4. Check your build settings: Make sure your build settings are configured correctly. Check the "Build Settings" tab in Xcode and make sure everything is set up correctly for your project.

5. Check for any missing files: Make sure all of the files in your project are present and accounted for. Sometimes, a missing file can cause this error.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to dig deeper into the specific error messages you're seeing to try to pinpoint the issue. You can also try reaching out to the developers of the pods you're using to see if they have any suggestions.

This error can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as outdated pods, incompatible Swift versions, or missing frameworks. Here are some steps you can take to resolve the issue:

1. Check the version of Swift used in your project and make sure it is compatible with the version used in the pods. You can do this by checking the Podfile.lock file.

2. Update your pods to the latest version by running the command "pod update" in your project directory.

3. Clean your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode or by running the command "clean" in the terminal.

4. Check if any of the pods have missing frameworks or dependencies. You can do this by opening the pod's .xcworkspace file and checking for any errors or missing files.

5. If none of the above steps work, try removing the problematic pods and adding them back again.

If the issue still persists, you can try reaching out to the developers of the problematic pods for further assistance.
