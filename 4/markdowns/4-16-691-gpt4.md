Apparently, none of the Flutter commands are working in the terminal of Android Studio which I believe I am trying to run it at the root of my project.
Output:
```
bash: flutter: command not found
```

The error message `bash: flutter: command not found` means that Flutter is not added to your system path. Here are the steps to add Flutter to your system path:

1. **Find the path to your Flutter bin directory.** It's usually in the place where you installed Flutter. For example, if you installed Flutter in your home directory, the path would be `~/flutter/bin`.

2. **Add the Flutter bin directory to your system path.** The process to do this depends on your operating system:

   - **On macOS and Linux:**

     Open `$HOME/.bashrc` or `$HOME/.zshrc` file in a text editor. If you're using another shell, the file you need to open may be different. Add the following line to the end of the file:

     ```
     export PATH="$PATH:`<your_flutter_directory>`/flutter/bin"
     ```

     Replace `<your_flutter_directory>` with the path where you installed Flutter.

     Save the file and exit the text editor. Then, run the following command in your terminal to refresh your system path:

     ```
     source $HOME/.bashrc
     ```

     or

     ```
     source $HOME/.zshrc
     ```

   - **On Windows:**

     Right click on 'My Computer' and click on 'Properties'. Then, click on 'Advanced system settings'. In the System Properties window, click on 'Environment Variables'.

     In the Environment Variables window, under 'System variables', click on 'Path' and then click on 'Edit'. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on 'New' and then add the full path to the Flutter bin directory.

3. **Verify that Flutter has been added to your system path.** Close and reopen your terminal, navigate to your Flutter project directory, and then run the following command:

   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

   If Flutter has been added to your system path correctly, you should see output indicating that Flutter is checking your system for compatibility. If you still see the `bash: flutter: command not found` error, Flutter has not been added to your system path correctly.

The error message you're seeing indicates that the Flutter SDK is not added to your system path, hence the terminal cannot recognize `flutter` as a command. Here's how you can add it:

1. **Find your Flutter Directory**: You need to know where you have downloaded and stored your Flutter SDK. The folder name is usually `flutter`.

2. **Update System Variables**: 

   - **For Windows**:
     - Search for 'Environment Variables' on your computer (you can use Windows Search for this).
     - Click on 'Edit the system environment variables'.
     - In the System Properties window that pops up, click on 'Environment Variables'.
     - In the Environment Variables window, under 'System Variables', find the `Path` variable, select it and click on 'Edit'.
     - In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on 'New' and then add the full path of your `flutter/bin` directory.
     - Click 'OK' on all windows to save the changes.

   - **For macOS/Linux**:
     - Open Terminal.
     - Enter `vi ~/.bash_profile` for macOS or `vi ~/.bashrc` for Linux.
     - Press 'i' to enter insert mode.
     - Add the following line to the file: `export PATH="$PATH:`<path to your flutter directory>`/flutter/bin"`.
     - Press 'ESC', type `:wq`, and press 'Enter' to save and exit.

3. **Verify Installation**: Open a new terminal window and run the `flutter doctor` command. If the Flutter SDK has been added successfully, you should see a summary of any issues found, or a message saying no issues were found.

Remember to replace `<path to your flutter directory>` with your actual Flutter directory path.

The error message you're seeing typically means that Flutter is not added to your system path. Here's how you can add Flutter to your system path:

1. **Find your Flutter Directory**: First, you need to find where your Flutter SDK is installed. If you don't remember where you installed it, you can search for it in your file system.

2. **Update System Path**:

   - **For Windows**:

     - Right-click on 'My Computer' and click on 'Properties'.
     - Click on 'Advanced system settings'.
     - Click on 'Environment Variables'.
     - Under 'System Variables', find the 'Path' variable, select it and click on 'Edit'.
     - In the 'Variable value' field, append the full path of the 'flutter/bin' directory in the Flutter SDK installation path, separated by a semicolon from the existing entry. Do not remove any existing entries.
     - Click on 'OK' and close all windows.
     - Restart Android Studio and try running the Flutter command again.

   - **For macOS/Linux**:

     - Open Terminal.
     - Type `nano ~/.bash_profile` for Bash or `nano ~/.zshrc` for Zsh.
     - Add the following line at the end of the file: `export PATH="$PATH:`<path to your flutter directory>`/flutter/bin"`.
     - Press `CTRL + X` to exit, then `Y` to confirm the changes, and finally `Enter` to save the file.
     - Run `source ~/.bash_profile` for Bash or `source ~/.zshrc` for Zsh to update the current terminal window.
     - Verify the installation by running `flutter doctor` in the terminal.

Remember to replace `<path to your flutter directory>` with your actual Flutter SDK path.

3. **Verify Installation**: After you've added Flutter to your system path, you can verify that it's correctly installed by opening a new terminal window and running the command `flutter doctor`. This command checks your environment and displays a report of the status of your Flutter installation. If Flutter is correctly installed, you should see a check mark next to each item in the report.
