Command `PhaseScriptExecution` failed with a `nonzero` exit code

I deleted derived data.
i have tried :  

> keychain access -> right click on login -> lock & unlock again ->
  clear Xcode project

Restarted machine, no use

How do I resolve "`Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code`" error when trying to archive project. 

And I am using those librarys 

```
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift'
pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 4.0'
pod 'KRPullLoader'
pod 'Paytm-Payments'
```

For me, I was removing Crashlytics, Fabric and FirebaseCrashlytics. So there was a script (Run Script) for Fabric. So since app was running that first and I had removed the framework already, I was getting this error. So I removed the Run Script tab for Fabrics and then it worked perfectly fine.

I have faced the same issue in . I have updated the Crashlytics SDK after that I got the same issue.
In my case I have followed the 

I have removed the data from .
-> Targets ->go to Build Settings ->Click Run Script -> Remove script data
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/iy4wx.png)

If script is mandatory to your project just select  option.
Select  option
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/jPoC9.png)
Script:
```
"${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols" -gsp "${PROJECT_DIR}/#####/GoogleService-Info.plist" -p ios "${DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH}/${DWARF_DSYM_FILE_NAME}"
```

In the above script  is the app name, if required replace with your app name. If not, use below script.
```
"${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols" -gsp "${PROJECT_DIR}/GoogleService-Info.plist" -p ios "${DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH}/${DWARF_DSYM_FILE_NAME}"
```


And one more importent thing is you must set the path of the file properly.
Find the below example path.
You have multiple google services plist piles, in this case you are
maintaining 2 different files.
Your google service info plist file was under . In this case you must add these files path properly. Otherwise you will get the same error.
```
"${PODS_ROOT}/FirebaseCrashlytics/upload-symbols" -gsp "${PROJECT_DIR}/#####/Firebase/Dev/GoogleService-Info.plist" -p ios "${DWARF_DSYM_FOLDER_PATH}/${DWARF_DSYM_FILE_NAME}"

For me, the issue was with the node version that xcode was using. My project was building fine in Expo but not in Xcode after ejecting. I found my answer here: [https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/8488](https://github.com/expo/expo/issues/8488)
- check you have the latest version of node`$ node --version`- delete the version in /usr/local/bin/`$ rm /usr/local/bin/node`- re add a sym link`$ ln -s $(which node) /usr/local/bin/node`

I had a similar error
```
/{path to project root}/Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-{project name}/Pods-{project name}-frameworks.sh: Permission denied
Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code
```

In my case I had received a zip of a repo that included the Pods folder. It turns out that at some point between it being originally created and sent to me, the *.sh files in `Pods/Target Support Files/Pods-{PROJECT}/` had all lost their execute permissions. Giving those files `+x` was the solution
For Example:
chmod +x (File name in the error)
In my case: `chmod +x Pods-TestExample-frameworks.sh`

Another reason for the error might be is that Xcode is running a script during the run phase.
If this is the case, you have 2 options:

1. Delete the script (makes sense if the script is NOT important)
2. Modify/update the scripts location path (Xcode might not be able to locate the script)


[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pcahd.png)
In my case, the script was important, so I modified/updated its location.
Originally, the script location path was written like this:
```
$SRCROOT/scripts/clean-assets.sh
```

Because the scripts path contained spaces (I moved the project to a new directory), I changed the path to this:
```
"$SRCROOT"/scripts/clean-assets.sh
```

By adding quotes to , changing it to , the error will go away.

If you are doing Unity Project. You can get this error.
```
Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code
```

The solution is very simple
[https://forum.unity.com/threads/error-on-build.561706/](https://forum.unity.com/threads/error-on-build.561706/)
Pre-requisites: Have cocoapods installed
Not Needed: `$sudo gem install cocoapods`

1. Open your project folder using terminal
2. Run this line: chmod +x MapFileParser.sh
3. Run this line: chmod +x process_symbols.sh


It worked for me)
I think that installing "cocoapods" is not necessary, only step 3 and 4 enough to solve, but it does not work, you can try it.

If you experience this issue in flutter. Try running the application on a real iPhone device from other IDE like android studio or vs code.
The issue was flutter SDK missing iOS-profile-release.
So by running the flutter command
```
flutter run
```

It downloads the missing things before running and this solves the problem.

For Xcode 11, React Native development environment.
I usually have this problem when a dependency is not updated.

You can try following these steps, this usually works for me:

1- Delete your Podfile.lock (I like to use the command '-rm -rf Podfile.lock' on the terminal for this)

2- Delete your Pods folder (I like to use the command '-rm -rf Pods' in the terminal for this)

3- Delete your .xcworkspace

4- Pod install

5- Clear your project into XCode> Product> Clean Build Folder

I was struggling with a similar problem in Xcode 14 (`error build: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code`). This error seems to be a very general description of some more detailed error but I didn't realize it for some time.
Finally I found the description of the error in Build log, but it was really frustrating to navigate there. I recommend you to read the detailed error first and then act. Xcode is not so intuitive... Follow [this](https://stackoverflow.com/a/30084344/9317258) and navigate there. I hope that it saves time to someone.

From Xcode 12.2, you need to remove the `$(VALID_ARCHS)` build setting from your main and CocoaPods targets, and use `$(ARCHS_STANDARD)` for all targets. Also, switching to the Legacy Build System is no longer a good solution, since Xcode will deprecate this in a future release. Clear derived data after applying these changes, and before a new rebuild.

Specifically for Flutter!
It turned out to be because I move a folder with `.dart` files to a new location and imports referencing the old directory were still in the code. Deleting those imports fixes the problem.
Unfortunately, with VSCode, all you get is a warning that the import is not used, not that it doesn't exits! Opening Xcode revealed these errors.

If you need to run the project in a physical device, none of the answers worked for me in Xcode 13.3. What worked for me was deleting VALID_ARCHS = x86_64; from project.pbxproj everywhere. but this won't let you run in simulator

Facing the same issue check if the parent directory name of your project has no space for Example my project name todoapp is inside My App directory change it to MyApp and it should work.

I am using multi development environments. One in the office and one at home. The office is the one that I continually use and keep in shape. The one at home I rarely use and hence it becomes out of sync. I am not speaking about the repo being out of date but rather the development environment itself.
So, cutting into chase, my error was more related to new updates resulting from deprecated/obsolete classes which are not available in mu home environment. in office I upgraded to Flutter 3.3 but at home I was still using Flutter 3.0. so there were few new things introduced in 3.3 which I started using and which do not exist in 3.0.
The solution was to upgrade Flutter and then build again.
run `flutter upgrade` in terminal.

This issue is literally related to your Xcode build phase script. 
In my case, In the `Target -> Build Phases -> Bundle React Native code and Images`, I found some issue in my build script for Sentry. 
It was the path that node binary is located. My script wanted node to be in `usr/local/bin/node` but my path was `opt/homebrew/bin/node` something like that. 
So I just uninstalled node via homebrew and installed node directly from their homepage. And now it works like charm.

# More general debugging help


Note that you can double-click the error in the build log to get more details:

Then you will get a tab with the current build log containing more information. Read it really carefully to see if there is a more specific description of the problem there.

In my case I was using Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile and had an error in my build configuration flags there.
If double-clicking does not work: Apparently, you sometimes need to retry building by pressing `Cmd + B` before being able to double-click the message. I sometimes had to do this multiple times before I could inspect the logs this way.

I'm try
After trying almost ALL ways of fixing this issue I came across this command:
```
flutter run -v > log.txt
```

This command creates file which logs all events of your build.
Among this long text I found I found a line with a word "error".
I guess it's easier just to press cmnd + F and type "error" or "exception" to find the key lines.
Anyway it gave me a key that .
My solution was removing this package.

Another possible problem solution for React Native developers: 
When building in debug mode - make sure  is free, not busy for other app (in my case antivirus agent after restart) or if previous metro service is not hanged there.
Check for processes listening on given port numbers:
```
sudo lsof -i -P | grep LISTEN | grep :$PORT
```

If found something on port 8081 - kill it with it's pid id
```
sudo kill -9 {PID_ID}
```

In my case, the problem occurred because I changed my Intel Core i5 processor to an Apple m2 processor.

Step 1 - Open Finder -> Applications -> Xcode (right click) -> Get Info -> Open with Rosetta check the box
Step 2 - Open Finder -> Applications -> Utilities -> Terminal (right click) -> Open with Rosetta.
Step 3 - Restart the machine. Then it will ask for Rosetta installation. Install Rosetta. Then run Xcode.

I bumped into this issue when upgrading react native from 0.68 to 0.69.
I was missing `ios/.xcode.env.local` file. Just added result of `which node` there for `NODE_BINARY`: `export NODE_BINARY="/opt/homebrew/bin/node"` there as in `ios/.xcode.env` and problem was fixed;

I had the same problem in Xcode 11.5 after revoking a certificate through Apple's developer homepage and adding it again (even though it looked different afterwards):

Every time I tried to archive my app, it would fail at the very end (not the pods but my actual app) with the same `PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code` error message. There is/was a valid team with an "Apple Development" signing certificate in "Signing & Capabilities" (project file in Xcode) and locking & unlocking the keychain, cleaning & building the project, restarting,... didn't work.

The problem was caused by having two active certificates of the same type that I must have added on accident, in addition to the renewed one. I deleted both the renewed one and the duplicate and it worked again.

You can find your certificates [here](https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/certificates/list) or find the page like this:

- [https://developer.apple.com/](https://developer.apple.com/)- - - 

Also check that there aren't any duplicates in your keychain! Be careful though - don't delete or add anything unless you know what you're doing, otherwise you might create a huge mess!

The  “Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code” error message can be concerning for developers. This may mean that an application or script is not running properly. Some potential solutions can be attempted to troubleshoot the issue.

Open the Xcode project folder in your Terminal app.
Enter and execute the following command: pod deintegrate
Execute this 
Run your app again.

Head over to Keychain Access.
Select Lock & unlock again from the login option.
Open 
If neither of those solutions works, then it is possible to reach out to Apple for support.
