I'm trying to install `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` from the Powershell command line on a Win 7 computer not connected to the internet. I'm running PS  5.1.14409.1005. I obtained the nupkg from [https://www.preview.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate/2.0.0.4](https://www.preview.powershellgallery.com/packages/PSWindowsUpdate/2.0.0.4)

The `PS` command `Install-Module -Name pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg -Repository {path to pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg}` throws an error message:

> PowerShellGet requires NuGet provider version '2.8.5.201' or newer to interact with NuGet-based repositories. The NuGet provider must be available in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' or 'C:\Users{my login}\AppData\Local\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies'. You can also install the NuGet provider by running 'Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -MinimumVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force'. Do you want PowerShell to install and import the NuGet provider now?

Saying 'yes', of course, fails to install the NuGet provider because I'm not connected to the internet.

I obtained `nuget.exe` (v4.7.0), stored it in 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' and added 'C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies' to my `path` statement. However, executing `Install-Module -Name pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg -Repository {path to pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg}` still fails.

What exactly is a `NuGet provider`? Is it just nuget.exe? How do I obtain and install the Nuget provider (v2.8.5.201 or greater) for PowerShell so I can install this nuget package from the PowerShell command line?

MSDocs state this for your scenario:

> In order to execute the first time, PackageManagement requires an
  internet connection to download the Nuget package provider. However,
  if your computer does not have an internet connection and you need to
  use the Nuget or PowerShellGet provider, you can download them on
  another computer and copy them to your target computer. Use the
  following steps to do this:
1. Run Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.201 -Force to install the provider from a computer with an internet connection.
2. After the install, you can find the provider installed in $env:ProgramFiles\PackageManagement\ReferenceAssemblies\\\<ProviderName\>\\\<ProviderVersion\> or $env:LOCALAPPDATA\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies\\\<ProviderName\>\\\<ProviderVersion\>.
3. Place the folder, which in this case is the Nuget folder, in the corresponding location on your target computer. If your target computer is a Nano server, you need to run Install-PackageProvider from Nano Server to download the correct Nuget binaries.
4. Restart PowerShell to auto-load the package provider. Alternatively, run Get-PackageProvider -ListAvailable to list all the package providers available on the computer. Then use Import-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.201 to import the provider to the current Windows PowerShell session.

Although I've tried all the previous answers, only the following one worked out:

1 - Open Powershell (as Admin)

2 - Run: 

```
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12
```


3 - Run:

```
Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet
```

I accepted [trebleCode's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/51409031/1501497), but I wanted to provide a bit more detail regarding the steps I took to install the nupkg of interest `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` on my unconnected Win 7 machine by way of following trebleCode's answer.
First: after digging around a bit, I think I found the MS docs that trebleCode refers to:
[Bootstrap the NuGet provider and NuGet.exe](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/gallery/how-to/getting-support/bootstrapping-nuget)
[Install-PackageProvider](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/packagemanagement/install-packageprovider?view=powershell-6)
To continue, as trebleCode stated, I did the following

On a connected machine (Win 10 machine), from the PS command line, I ran `Install-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.208 -Force`. The Nuget software was obtained from the 'Net and installed on my local connected machine.
After the install I found the NuGet provider software at `C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies` (Note: the folder name `\ProviderAssemblies` as opposed to `\ReferenceAssemblies` was the one minor difference relative to trebleCode's answer.
The provider software is in a folder structure like this:
```
C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies
   \NuGet
      \2.8.5.208
         \Microsoft.PackageManagement.NuGetProvider.dll
```


I copied the \NuGet folder (and all its children) from the connected machine onto a thumb drive and copied it to `C:\Program Files\PackageManagement\ProviderAssemblies` on my unconnected (Win 7) machine
I started PS (v5) on my  unconnected (Win 7) machine and ran `Import-PackageProvider -Name NuGet -RequiredVersion 2.8.5.208` to import the provider to the current `PowerShell` session.
I ran `Get-PackageProvider -ListAvailable` and saw this (NuGet appears where it was not present before):

On unconnected (Win 7) machine, I created a folder to serve as my PS repository (say, `c:\users\foo\Documents\PSRepository`)
I registered the repo: `Register-PSRepository -Name fooPsRepository -SourceLocation c:\users\foo\Documents\PSRepository -InstallationPolicy Trusted`

I obtained and copied the nupkg `pswindowsupdate.2.0.0.4.nupkg` to `c:\users\foo\Documents\PSRepository` on my unconnected Win7 machine
I learned the name of the module by executing `Find-Module -Repository fooPsRepository`

I installed the module by executing `Install-Module -Name pswindowsupdate`
I verified the module installed by executing `Get-Command â€“module PSWindowsUpdate`

I think I'm good to go

The provider is bundled with PowerShell>=6.0.
If all you need is a way to install a package from a file, just grab the .msi installer for the latest version from the github releases page, copy it over to the machine, install it and use it.

Here is the script I use in a `Dockerfile` based on `windows/servercore` to achieve complete PowerShellGallery setup through Artifactory mirrors (also for onegetcdn.azureedge.net)
```
ARG ONEGET_NUGET_PROVIDER="Microsoft.PackageManagement.NuGetProvider-2.8.5.208.dll"
ARG ONEGET_PROVIDERS="https://artifactory/artifactory/generic-azureedge-onegetcdn/providers/"
 
RUN $ProviderPath = 'C:/Program Files/PackageManagement/ProviderAssemblies/'; `
    New-Item -ItemType "directory" -Path $ProviderPath -Force; `
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "${Env:ONEGET_PROVIDERS}${Env:ONEGET_NUGET_PROVIDER}" -OutFile "${ProviderPath}${Env:ONEGET_NUGET_PROVIDER}"; `
    Register-PSRepository -Name "artifactory-powershellgallery-remote" -SourceLocation "https://artifactory/artifactory/api/nuget/powershellgallery-remote"; `
    Unregister-PSRepository -Name PSGallery;
```

Location and dll version are visible at [https://onegetcdn.azureedge.net/providers/providers.masterList.feed.swidtag](https://onegetcdn.azureedge.net/providers/providers.masterList.feed.swidtag)

None of the options in this thread worked for me. I'm using PowerShell Core 7.1.5. What worked for me was to remove Windows Powershell Modules from $env:PSModulePath. Essentially, check your environment variables and look for any path that has "WindowsPowerShell" and remove it.

In order to install the Nuget Package Manager non-interactively, simply use the `-Force` flag which bypasses prompting:
`Install-PackageProvider NuGet -Force`
You do not have to use the trick about the security protocol, at least for Windows Powershell (5.1).
