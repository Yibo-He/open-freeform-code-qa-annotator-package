(I am using MAC)
My id_rsa starts with
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

but I expect it to starts with
```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I have send my id_rsa.pub to server administrator to get the access to server, so I don't want to generate a new key.

1. Is there any way that I can transfer my id_rsa which is a openssh private key to a RSA private key? (command please.)
2. If I can transfer, do I also need to transfer id_rsa.pub? (command please.) It seems id_rsa.pub doesn't have a header like id_rsa, so I am not sure if I should also transfer this.

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. Here is the command to do that:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for your passphrase (if you set one), and then it will write the RSA private key out to the same file, replacing the OpenSSH key.

2. No, you do not need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and does not need to be converted. The public key does not have a header like the private key because it is a simpler format. The server only needs the public key to authenticate you, so as long as you have converted your private key on your local machine, you should be able to connect to the server.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a traditional RSA private key. Here's the command:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will ask you to enter a passphrase. If you don't want to use a passphrase, just press enter when prompted.

2. No, you don't need to convert the public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have different versions like the private key. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key, so you don't need to worry about it.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to a RSA private key. Here is the command you need to run:

```bash
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you for the passphrase (if any) and then rewrite the private key in place with the RSA version. The `-p` option tells ssh-keygen to change the passphrase of a private key file, `-m PEM` tells it to use the older PEM private key format instead of the new OpenSSH format, and `-f ~/.ssh/id_rsa` specifies the file to convert.

2. No, you don't need to convert your public key. The public key format is standard and doesn't have the same OpenSSH vs RSA format issue. The public key file (id_rsa.pub) can be used as is. The public key doesn't have a header like the private key because it's a simpler format, just a single line of text.
