I've recently picked up an Android Studio project I started a year ago in Kotlin.
It features three fragments that can be navigated through by a bottom navigation bar.
Now, to break my current issue down to a simple example that even doesn't work for me:
Given there's a the editText object `exercise` in `fragment_home.xml` and I want to call and alter it in `HomeFragment.kt`.
I checked every source of advice I could find from Google & Stackoverflow and came up with the following code in `HomeFragment.kt` (partially pre-coded by AndroidStudio):
```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        val view: View = inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home,container,false)

        view.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

The last line stands for every object I tried to reach. I also tried onClickListening for buttons like so:
```
val btnNewExercise =  view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {view

            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
```

but nothing happens when I start the app/ hit the buttons - I seem to can't get through to the actual view's objects to access them. Even ran into NullPointerExceptions on my way to a solution.
I could supply the fragment and layout files if needed - just thought this way it might be easier at first.
If anybody could tell me where I'm wrong I'd be really grateful! Thanks in advance!

You inflated the layout twice.
Remove this. You already inflated the layout using view binding in the    call
```
val view: View = inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home,container,false)
```

and replace
```
view.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

with (using binding
```
binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

then the last line on your onCreateView should be
```
return binding.root
```

Note: You should have these class properties:
```
private var _binding: FragmentHomeBinding? = null
private val binding get() = _binding!!
```

So it will look like this:
```
//move your view model as a class property so it will be accessible by other class methods
                 private val homeViewModel =
                          ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

 
                 private var _binding: FragmentHomeBinding? = null
                 private val binding get() = _binding!!//transform to immutable
            
                 override fun onCreateView(
                        inflater: LayoutInflater,
                        container: ViewGroup?,
                        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
                    ): View? {

                        
                
                        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
                      
                       //use the immutable view binding property
                        binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
            
                        return binding.root
                   }
```

Try this solution.
```
class HomeFragment : Fragment() {

    private var _binding: FragmentHomeBinding? = null
    private val binding get() = _binding!!

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater, container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View {
  val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root

    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)
        binding.exercise.text="This is an exceptionally hardcoded string"

        binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")

        }
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```

You need to return the view you made in the OnCreateView .
