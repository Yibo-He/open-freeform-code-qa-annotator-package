 Question for better understanding and how do i want the result is.
> Wizhi answer almost matched for my question !! But need some more
changes in his answer because which code is not working for me !! And
no need to work based on  as he answered. The split work
done based on  .
Please help someone help me to Macro Code for Split data into multiple sheet within an excel workbook based on a table format. Below is the explanation of how i have done as per my knowledge and what is my expectation is !!

Please download the [Macro_Folder](https://www.dropbox.com/t/anX1TF2qb04cjO5r) and Unzip it in you "C" Drive.
Open Macro Workbook and Press Button to run macro.
If it asked for updating formulas as shown in below picture please select "Don't Update" to continue macro.

I Have done button option to Run the split macro in separate excel workbook.

When self open and run Macro from Macro Workbook it automatically opens my  and start formatting and split the date into multiple sheets.

1. I have done macro for format and Split Data into multiple Sheet,But this the not exact format result which i'm looking for.
2. The split should be done in same method but for result format should be like below formats based on macro code.
3. The split data should be in Multiple sheets of within an Excel Workbook . Not split to multiple workbooks !!


 for all

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

It seems like you want to modify your existing VBA macro to split data into multiple sheets within an Excel workbook based on a table format. However, your question is missing some crucial information that would help to provide a more accurate answer. 

1. You mentioned that the current code is not working for you. Could you please specify what kind of error or issue you are facing? Are you getting any error messages? If so, what do they say?

2. You mentioned that you want the split to be done in the same method, but the result format should be different. Could you please specify what exactly you want to be different in the result format?

3. You mentioned that the split data should be in multiple sheets within an Excel workbook, not split into multiple workbooks. Is the current code splitting the data into multiple workbooks instead of sheets?

4. You provided some images, but it's not clear what each image represents. Could you please clarify what each image is showing?

5. You provided a link to a Macro_Folder, but it's not accessible. Could you please check the link?

6. You mentioned that you want the final result to look like the examples you provided. However, it's not clear how these examples relate to your current data and code. Could you please explain how you want your data to be transformed to look like these examples?

Once you provide this information, it will be easier to understand your problem and provide a more accurate solution.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

From your question, it seems like you want to modify your existing VBA macro to split data into multiple sheets within an Excel workbook based on a table format. However, you want the final format of the split data to be different from what your current macro is producing.

Here's a modified version of your macro that should give you the desired result. This macro will split the data based on the column you specify and format the data in each new sheet as per your requirements.

Please replace your existing macro with the following code:

```vba
Sub Split_Data()

    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim myfilename As String
    Dim lr As Long
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim vcol, i As Integer
    Dim icol As Long
    Dim myarr As Variant
    Dim title As String
    Dim titlerow As Integer
    
    myfilename = "C:\Macro\XD MIS Report.xlsx"
    Set wb = Workbooks.Open(myfilename)

    'Your existing code for formatting the data goes here

    'Splitting the data into multiple sheets
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    vcol = Application.InputBox(prompt:="Which column would you like to filter by?", title:="Filter column", Default:="3", Type:=1)
    Set ws = ActiveSheet
    lr = ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, vcol).End(xlUp).Row
    title = "A1"
    titlerow = ws.Range(title).Cells(1).Row
    icol = ws.Columns.Count
    ws.Cells(1, icol) = "Unique"
    For i = 2 To lr
        On Error Resume Next
        If ws.Cells(i, vcol) <> "" And Application.WorksheetFunction.Match(ws.Cells(i, vcol), ws.Columns(icol), 0) = 0 Then
            ws.Cells(ws.Rows.Count, icol).End(xlUp).Offset(1) = ws.Cells(i, vcol)
        End If
    Next

    myarr = Application.WorksheetFunction.Transpose(ws.Columns(icol).SpecialCells(xlCellTypeConstants))
    ws.Columns(icol).Clear

    For i = 2 To UBound(myarr)
        ws.Range(title).AutoFilter field:=vcol, Criteria1:=myarr(i) & ""
        If Not Evaluate("=ISREF('" & myarr(i) & "'!A1)") Then
            Sheets.Add(after:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)).Name = myarr(i) & ""
        Else
            Sheets(myarr(i) & "").Move after:=Worksheets(Worksheets.Count)
        End If
        ws.Range("A" & titlerow & ":A" & lr).EntireRow.Copy Sheets(myarr(i) & "").Range("A1")
        
        'Your code for formatting the data in each new sheet goes here
    Next

    ws.AutoFilterMode = False
    ws.Activate
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True

End Sub
```

Please replace the comments `'Your existing code for formatting the data goes here` and `'Your code for formatting the data in each new sheet goes here` with your actual code for formatting the data.

This code will split the data into multiple sheets based on the column you specify and then format the data in each new sheet as per your requirements.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

Based on your description, it seems like you want to split your data into multiple sheets within the same workbook based on a specific column, and you want the data in each sheet to be formatted in a certain way.

Here is a simplified version of your macro that should do what you want:

```vba
Sub SplitData()

    Dim OriginalWs As Worksheet
    Dim NewWs As Worksheet
    Dim CurrentCell As Range
    Dim ColumnToSplit As Range
    Dim LastRow As Long
    Dim UniqueValues As Collection
    Dim Value As Variant
    
    ' Set the original worksheet
    Set OriginalWs = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    ' Find the last row in the column you want to split by
    LastRow = OriginalWs.Cells(OriginalWs.Rows.Count, "A").End(xlUp).Row
    
    ' Set the range of cells you want to split by
    Set ColumnToSplit = OriginalWs.Range("A2:A" & LastRow)
    
    ' Create a new collection to store unique values in the column
    Set UniqueValues = New Collection
    
    ' Loop through each cell in the column
    For Each CurrentCell In ColumnToSplit
        ' Try to add the cell's value to the collection
        On Error Resume Next
        UniqueValues.Add CurrentCell.Value, CStr(CurrentCell.Value)
        On Error GoTo 0
    Next CurrentCell
    
    ' Loop through each unique value in the collection
    For Each Value In UniqueValues
        ' Add a new worksheet for the unique value
        Set NewWs = ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Add(After:=ThisWorkbook.Sheets(ThisWorkbook.Sheets.Count))
        NewWs.Name = Value
        
        ' Filter the original worksheet by the unique value
        OriginalWs.Rows(1).AutoFilter Field:=1, Criteria1:=Value
        
        ' Copy the visible (filtered) cells to the new worksheet
        OriginalWs.Cells.Copy Destination:=NewWs.Cells
        
        ' Turn off the filter in the original worksheet
        OriginalWs.AutoFilterMode = False
    Next Value

End Sub
```

This macro will create a new worksheet for each unique value in column A of the original worksheet. It will then filter the original worksheet by that value and copy the visible cells to the new worksheet.

Please replace "Sheet1" with the name of your original worksheet and "A" with the column you want to split by.

You can add your formatting code to the end of the loop to format each new worksheet as desired.
