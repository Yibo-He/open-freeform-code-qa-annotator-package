I want to set tab for zsh autocomplition plugin. There is related part of config:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                tab-char //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```


What is the convention for char names used?
How does tab named?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

In ZSH, the tab key is represented by the widget `expand-or-complete`. So, if you want to set tab for zsh autocompletion plugin, you should replace `tab-char` with `expand-or-complete` in your configuration.

Here is the corrected part of your config:

```bash
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                expand-or-complete //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```

The convention for char names used in ZSH is typically the action that the key performs. For example, `forward-char` moves the cursor forward by one character, `end-of-line` moves the cursor to the end of the line, and `expand-or-complete` expands or completes the current word.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The convention for character names in ZSH is generally descriptive. For example, `forward-char` refers to moving the cursor forward by one character, and `end-of-line` refers to moving the cursor to the end of the line.

The Tab key is usually represented as `expand-or-complete` or `magic-space` in ZSH. So, if you want to set the Tab key for the ZSH autocompletion plugin, you should use one of these names.

Here is how you can modify your configuration:

```bash
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                expand-or-complete //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```

This configuration will make the Tab key accept the entire suggestion provided by the ZSH autocompletion plugin.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In zsh, the tab key is usually represented as `accept-line` or `expand-or-complete`. If you want to use the tab key for accepting autosuggestions, you can add either of these to your `ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS` array.

Here is how you can modify your configuration:

```bash
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                accept-line //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```

or

```bash
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                expand-or-complete //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```

Remember to source your zsh configuration file or restart your terminal session for the changes to take effect.
