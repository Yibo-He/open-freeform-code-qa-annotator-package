How can I tell if a specified folder is in my PATH using PowerShell?
A function like this would be great:
```
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # If the directory is in PATH, return true, otherwise false
}
```

You can achieve this by splitting the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and then checking if your specified directory is in that array. Here is a function that does exactly that:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # Get the PATH environment variable and split it into an array of directories
    $PATH_directories = $env:PATH -split ';'

    # Check if the specified directory is in the array
    if ($PATH_directories -contains $Path_to_directory) {
        return $true
    } else {
        return $false
    }
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```powershell
if (FolderIsInPATH("C:\Windows\System32")) {
    Write-Host "The directory is in PATH"
} else {
    Write-Host "The directory is not in PATH"
}
```

This will print "The directory is in PATH" if "C:\Windows\System32" is in your PATH, and "The directory is not in PATH" otherwise.

You can check if a specified folder is in your PATH by splitting the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and then checking if your specified directory is in that array. Here is a PowerShell function that does this:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # Get the PATH environment variable and split it into an array of directories
    $pathArray = $env:Path -split ';'

    # Check if the specified directory is in the array
    if ($pathArray -contains $Path_to_directory) {
        # If it is, return true
        return $true
    } else {
        # If it isn't, return false
        return $false
    }
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```powershell
if (FolderIsInPATH("C:\Some\Directory")) {
    Write-Host "The directory is in the PATH"
} else {
    Write-Host "The directory is not in the PATH"
}
```

This will print "The directory is in the PATH" if "C:\Some\Directory" is in your PATH, and "The directory is not in the PATH" otherwise.

You can check if a specified folder is in your PATH by splitting the PATH environment variable into an array of directories and then checking if your specified directory is in that array. Here's how you can do it in PowerShell:

```powershell
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # Get the PATH environment variable and split it into an array of directories
    $pathDirs = $env:Path -split ';'

    # Check if the specified directory is in the array
    if ($pathDirs -contains $Path_to_directory) {
        # If it is, return true
        return $true
    } else {
        # If it's not, return false
        return $false
    }
}
```

You can use this function like this:

```powershell
if (FolderIsInPATH("C:\Windows\System32")) {
    Write-Host "The folder is in PATH"
} else {
    Write-Host "The folder is not in PATH"
}
```

This will output "The folder is in PATH" if "C:\Windows\System32" is in your PATH, and "The folder is not in PATH" if it's not.

Please note that this function is case-sensitive. If you want to make it case-insensitive, you can convert both the PATH directories and the input directory to the same case (either lower or upper) before comparing them.
