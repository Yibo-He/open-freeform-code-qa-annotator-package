```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi '$searchT') ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT' && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT')

else echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

How do I make the script run if the `if statement` is true. when i run the script the script will output the `else` statement. because there is no value to compare with the grep command.

The issue with your script is that you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable.

To fix this, you can use double quotes around the `grep` command and escape the inner double quotes with a backslash. Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep "$searchT" test.txt

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, we removed the `cat` command and piped the output of `grep` directly to `wc -l` and `echo`. We also removed the single quotes around `$searchT` in the `grep` command and replaced them with escaped double quotes. Finally, we simplified the `if` statement by using the exit status of `grep` directly.

The issue with your script is that you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is looking for the literal string `$searchT` instead of the value of the variable.

To fix this, you can use double quotes instead of single quotes around the `grep` command. This will allow the variable to be expanded and the search term to be properly passed to `grep`. Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt; then     
    echo "$(grep "$searchT" test.txt | wc -l) number of matches found"
    grep "$searchT" test.txt

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

The issue with your script is that you are using single quotes around the `$searchT` variable in the `grep` command. Single quotes prevent variable expansion, so the `grep` command is searching for the literal string "$searchT" instead of the value of the variable.

To fix this, you can use double quotes around the `grep` command and escape the double quotes inside the command. Here's the updated script:

```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if grep -wi "$searchT" test.txt >/dev/null; then
    echo "$(grep -wic "$searchT" test.txt) number of matches found"
    grep -win "$searchT" test.txt
else
    echo "no match found"
fi

exit 0
```

In this updated script, we use double quotes around the `grep` command and escape the double quotes inside the command. We also use the `-c` option with `grep` to count the number of matches, and the `-n` option to show the line numbers of the matches. Finally, we redirect the output of the first `grep` command to `/dev/null` to suppress it, since we only care about the output of the second `grep` command.
