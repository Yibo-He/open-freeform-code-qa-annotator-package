I feel like I'm missing something very basic, but this example SwiftUI code will not modify the view (despite the Binding updating) when the button is clicked

[Tutorials](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/swiftui-understanding-binding-8e20269a76bc?) I have read suggest this is the correct way to use a binding and the view should refresh automatically

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

The issue with your code is that `ContentView_Previews` is not passing the `selected` state variable to the `ContentView`. Instead, it is creating a new `@State` variable called `selected` which is not connected to the `ContentView`.

To fix this, you need to modify `ContentView_Previews` to pass the `selected` state variable to the `ContentView` like this:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: .constant(false))
    }
}
```

This will create a constant binding to `false` which will be passed to the `ContentView`. Now, when you click the button, the `isSelected` binding will update and the view will refresh automatically.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The issue with your code is that you are using a `@Binding` property in your `ContentView` struct, but you are not passing a binding to it when you create an instance of the view in your `ContentView_Previews` struct. 

To fix this, you need to create a binding to the `selected` state variable in your `ContentView_Previews` struct and pass it to the `ContentView` view like this:

```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

By using the `$` symbol before the `selected` state variable, you create a binding to it that can be passed to the `ContentView` view. 

With this change, your code should work as expected and the view should update when the button is clicked.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The issue with your code is that you are not passing the `isSelected` binding to the `Button` view. You need to use the `$` prefix to pass the binding to the `Button` view. Here's the modified code:

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

Notice the `$` prefix before `selected` in the `ContentView` preview. This passes the binding to the `ContentView` view, allowing it to update the view when the button is clicked.
