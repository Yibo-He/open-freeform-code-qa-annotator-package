The [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) app is advertised as a central hub for all terminal work, so I'm interested in a way to bring my SSH connections into it and replace ancient PuTTY.

Great idea! Windows Terminal is a powerful tool that can be used to manage multiple terminal sessions in one place. Here's how you can set up SSH connections in Windows Terminal:

1. Install OpenSSH client on your Windows machine. You can do this by going to Settings > Apps > Apps & features > Optional features > Add a feature > OpenSSH Client.

2. Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow next to the "+" icon in the tab bar. Select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. In the settings file, scroll down to the "profiles" section and add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```
{
    "guid": "{your-ssh-guid-here}",
    "name": "SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@hostname",
    "icon": "C:/path/to/icon.png"
}
```

Replace `{your-ssh-guid-here}` with a unique identifier for your SSH connection, `user` with your username, `hostname` with the hostname or IP address of the remote machine, and `C:/path/to/icon.png` with the path to an icon file for your connection.

4. Save the settings file and restart Windows Terminal.

5. You should now see your SSH connection profile in the dropdown menu in the tab bar. Click on it to open a new tab with your SSH session.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside other terminal sessions.

Yes, Windows Terminal is a great tool for managing multiple terminal sessions in one place. To add SSH connections to Windows Terminal, you can follow these steps:

1. Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow icon in the tab bar to open the drop-down menu.
2. Click on "Settings" to open the settings file in your default text editor.
3. Scroll down to the "profiles" section and add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```
{
    "guid": "{YOUR_GUID_HERE}",
    "name": "SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@hostname",
    "icon": "C:\\path\\to\\icon.png"
}
```

Replace `{YOUR_GUID_HERE}` with a unique identifier for this profile. You can generate a new GUID using an online tool. Replace `user@hostname` with your SSH username and hostname. Replace `C:\\path\\to\\icon.png` with the path to an icon file for this profile (optional).

4. Save the settings file and close the text editor.
5. Click on the down arrow icon again and select "SSH Connection" (or whatever you named your profile) to open the SSH session in a new tab.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside other terminal sessions.

    "commandline": "ssh user@host",
    "icon": "C:\\path\\to\\icon.png",
    "hidden": false
}
```

Replace `{YOUR_GUID_HERE}` with a unique identifier for this profile. You can generate a new GUID using an online tool or by running the `New-Guid` command in PowerShell.

Replace `user@host` with your SSH username and hostname.

Replace `C:\\path\\to\\icon.png` with the path to an icon file for this profile. This is optional, but it can help you quickly identify your SSH connection in the tab bar.

4. Save the settings file and close it.

5. Open a new tab in Windows Terminal and select your SSH profile from the drop-down menu.

6. Enter your SSH password when prompted and you should be connected to your remote host.

That's it! You can now use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections alongside your other terminal sessions.
