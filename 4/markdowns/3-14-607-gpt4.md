I have a textfield with a send button that's a systemImage arrow. I want the foreground color of the image to change depending on whether the textField is empty or not. (I.e. the button is gray, and it is disabled if the textfield is empty. It's blue if the count of the textfield text is > 1).
I have a workaround that's not perfect:
```
if chatMessageIsValid {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(Color.blue)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
    }
} else {
    Spacer()
    HStack {
        TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
            .padding(.leading, 10)
            .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
        Button(action: sendMessage) {
            Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
                .foregroundColor(Color.gray)
                .padding(.trailing, 10)
        }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
    }
}
```

This almost works, and it does change the color of the image if the text is > 1 in length. However, due to the change in state you're kicked out of editing the textfield after one character is typed, and you'll need to select the textfield again to continue typing. Is there a better way to do this with the .disabled modifier?

You can simplify your code by using a ternary operator to change the color of the image based on the `chatMessageIsValid` condition. This way, you won't need to duplicate your code and it won't kick you out of the text field after typing one character.

Here's how you can do it:

```swift
Spacer()
HStack {
    TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
        .padding(.leading, 10)
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    Button(action: sendMessage) {
        Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
            .foregroundColor(chatMessageIsValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
            .padding(.trailing, 10)
    }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
}
```

In this code, the color of the image will be blue if `chatMessageIsValid` is true, otherwise it will be gray. The button will be disabled if `chatMessageIsValid` is false.

You can simplify your code by using a ternary operator to change the color of the button based on the `chatMessageIsValid` condition. This way, you don't need to duplicate your code for each state of the button. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
Spacer()
HStack {
    TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
        .padding(.leading, 10)
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    Button(action: sendMessage) {
        Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
            .foregroundColor(chatMessageIsValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
            .padding(.trailing, 10)
    }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
}
```

In this code, the color of the button will be blue if `chatMessageIsValid` is true, otherwise it will be gray. The button will be disabled if `chatMessageIsValid` is false. This should solve your problem without kicking you out of the textfield after typing one character.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can simplify your code by using a ternary operator to change the color of the button based on the `chatMessageIsValid` condition. This way, you won't need to duplicate your code and the text field won't lose focus. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
Spacer()
HStack {
    TextField($chatMessage, placeholder: Text("Reply"))
        .padding(.leading, 10)
        .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
    Button(action: sendMessage) {
        Image(systemName: "arrow.up.circle")
            .foregroundColor(chatMessageIsValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)
            .padding(.trailing, 10)
    }.disabled(!chatMessageIsValid)
}
```

In this code, `foregroundColor(chatMessageIsValid ? Color.blue : Color.gray)` will set the color to blue if `chatMessageIsValid` is true, and gray if it's false. This will ensure that the color changes based on the validity of the chat message without causing the text field to lose focus.
