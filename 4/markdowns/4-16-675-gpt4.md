You can show the current branch name in your terminal prompt by modifying your bash prompt. Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your bash profile file. This is typically located at `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. You can open it with a text editor like nano or vim. For example:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the following lines to the end of the file:

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
    git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}
export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

This script adds a function `parse_git_branch` that fetches the current git branch and adds it to your bash prompt.

3. Save the file and exit the editor. If you used nano, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl+X`, then `Y` to confirm saving changes, then `Enter` to confirm the file name.

4. Apply the changes by sourcing your bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your terminal prompt should show the current git branch whenever you're in a git repository directory.

Please note that this will only work if you have git installed in your WSL environment. If you don't have it installed, you can install it with `sudo apt install git`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

You can use the `git` command to show the current branch name in your terminal. 

Here is a simple command to display the current branch:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

This command will return the name of the current branch.

If you want to display the branch name in your terminal prompt like in bash, you can modify your PS1 (Prompt String 1) variable in your bash profile. 

Here is a simple example:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

This will display the username, host, and current git branch in your terminal prompt.

To make this change permanent, you need to add this line to your bash profile. The bash profile is located in your home directory and is named `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` depending on your system. You can open it with a text editor and add the line at the end of the file.

Here is how you can do it:

1. Open your bash profile with a text editor. You can use `nano` for example:

```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
```

2. Add the line at the end of the file:

```bash
PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2> /dev/null)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

3. Save and close the file. If you used `nano`, you can do this by pressing `Ctrl + X`, then `Y` to confirm, and then `Enter`.

4. To apply the changes, you need to source your bash profile:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Now, your terminal prompt should display the current git branch.

You can use the `git` command to show the current branch name in your terminal.

Here's how to do it:

1. Open your terminal in VSCode.

2. Navigate to your project directory.

3. Run the following command:

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

This command will output the name of the current branch that HEAD is pointing to.

If you want to show the current branch name in your terminal prompt like Bash, you can add the following lines to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file:

```bash
parse_git_branch() {
 git branch 2> /dev/null | sed -e '/^[^*]/d' -e 's/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/'
}

export PS1="\u@\h \[\033[32m\]\w\[\033[33m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ "
```

Then, source your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` file to apply the changes:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```
or
```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

Now, your terminal prompt will display the current branch name.

Please note that you need to have `git` installed in your WSL for these commands to work.
