How can I detect from a shell script that it is running on M1 Apple hardware?
I want to be able to run a command-line command so that I can write an `if`-statement whose body will only be executed when run on a mac with an M1 processor (and at least macOS Big Sur, naturally).

You can detect if your shell script is running on M1 Apple hardware by checking the output of the `uname -m` command. On M1 Apple hardware, the output will be `arm64`. Here's an example of how you can use this in an `if` statement:

```
if [[ $(uname -m) == "arm64" ]]; then
  # Your code for M1 Apple hardware goes here
fi
```

This will only execute the code inside the `if` statement if the `uname -m` command returns `arm64`, which is the architecture used by M1 Apple hardware.

You can use the `uname` command to get information about the system, including the processor architecture. On an M1 Mac, the processor architecture will be `arm64`. Here's an example shell script that checks for an M1 processor:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Get the processor architecture
arch=$(uname -m)

# Check if it's an M1 processor
if [[ "$arch" == "arm64" ]]; then
  echo "This is an M1 Mac"
else
  echo "This is not an M1 Mac"
fi
```

You can run this script on any Mac to see if it detects an M1 processor. If you want to check for macOS Big Sur as well, you can use the `sw_vers` command to get the macOS version:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Get the processor architecture
arch=$(uname -m)

# Get the macOS version
macos_version=$(sw_vers -productVersion)

# Check if it's an M1 Mac running macOS Big Sur
if [[ "$arch" == "arm64" && "$macos_version" == "11."* ]]; then
  echo "This is an M1 Mac running macOS Big Sur"
else
  echo "This is not an M1 Mac running macOS Big Sur"
fi
```

This script will only print "This is an M1 Mac running macOS Big Sur" if both conditions are true.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `uname` command to determine the processor architecture of the machine. On M1 Apple hardware, the processor architecture is `arm64`. Here's an example shell script that checks for the processor architecture and macOS version:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Get the processor architecture
arch=$(uname -m)

# Get the macOS version
os_version=$(sw_vers -productVersion)

# Check if the processor architecture is arm64 and the macOS version is at least 11.0
if [[ "$arch" == "arm64" && "$(echo "$os_version >= 11.0" | bc)" -eq 1 ]]; then
    echo "Running on M1 Apple hardware"
    # Add your commands here that should only be executed on M1 Apple hardware
fi
```

This script uses the `sw_vers` command to get the macOS version and the `bc` command to compare the version with 11.0. If the processor architecture is `arm64` and the macOS version is at least 11.0, the `if` statement will be true and the commands inside the `if` block will be executed.
