I need a way of opening the explorer at This PC , in the same way as opening in a windows explorer Gui, but I am incapable of this as using Explorer.exe in CMD opens quick access.

I tried opening it with a shortcut and that too failed. 

Does anyone know of a way to do this?

Cheers

Just like you can run `explorer.exe C:\` to open up the `C:` (or any other drive or folder path), you can also use a `file:` URI to open paths in Explorer as well. If you just specify the `file:` protocol without a directory (or specify `file:\\`), it will open `This PC`:
```
explorer file:
explorer file:\\
```

Note that you can also change the default Explorer location from `Quick Access` to `This PC` as well from `Folder Options`:

You can set this in the registry too if you're after automation to configure this. See my answer on [how you can use PowerShell to set the default launch folder in the registry](https://stackoverflow.com/a/69188962/584676).

My experience is that, the following should work:

From [cmd](/questions/tagged/cmd):

```
Start "" "%SystemRoot%\explorer.exe" /Select,"This PC"
```


From [powershell](/questions/tagged/powershell):

```
Start "$Env:SystemRoot\explorer.exe" "/Select,'This PC'"
```

You can use this in cmd:

```
Explorer /root,
```

On Powershell, we can do this:
```
(New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).Namespace("").Self.InvokeVerb()
```

We create a com object of class Shell.Application, then call
.InvokeVerb() that invokes the default verb "open".
Or more rigourously, by defining ssfDRIVES constant (see Microsoft [reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shldisp/ne-shldisp-shellspecialfolderconstants))
```
Set-Variable ssfDRIVES -Option Constant -Value 0x11
(New-Object -ComObject Shell.Application).Namespace($ssfDRIVES).Self.InvokeVerb()
```

> ssfDRIVES 0x11 (17). Namespace points to My Computerâ€”the virtual folder that
contains everything on the local computer: storage devices, printers,
and Control Panel. This folder can also contain mapped network drives.
