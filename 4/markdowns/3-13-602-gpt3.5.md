The app crashes as soon as it gets installed and throws the weird error above.
I have annotated the activity as shown below as well as its child fragments.
```
@AndroidEntryPoint
    class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
        companion object{
           lateinit var currentUser: User
        }
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_home)
            val navController = Navigation.findNavController(this, R.id.home_nav)
            val bottomNavigationView: BottomNavigationView = findViewById(R.id.bottom_navigation)
            bottomNavigationView.setupWithNavController(navController)
            fetchCurrentUser()
        }
```

Also attaching the Application class which is mandatory for every app using Hilt as per the documentation
```
@HiltAndroidApp
class CoreApplication:Application()
```

and the logcat of the crash
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is correctly annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp` and is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the application class. 

Also, check if you have added the `HiltAndroidRule` in your test class if you are using Hilt for testing. 

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the `android:name` attribute of the `<application>` tag. For example:

```
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...
```

Also, make sure that the `HomeActivity` is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file with the `android:name` attribute pointing to the fully qualified name of the `HomeActivity` class. For example:

```
<activity
    android:name="com.example.vcare.home.HomeActivity"
    ...
```

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project, and ensure that all dependencies are up to date.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message suggests that the `HomeActivity` is not attached to the `CoreApplication` annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`. 

Make sure that the `CoreApplication` class is declared in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file as the `android:name` attribute of the `<application>` tag. 

Also, check that the `build.gradle` file of the app module includes the `kapt` plugin and the necessary dependencies for Hilt. 

If the issue persists, try cleaning and rebuilding the project.
