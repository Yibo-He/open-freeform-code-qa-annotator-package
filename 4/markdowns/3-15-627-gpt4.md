In VBA, three main kinds of date time controls can be used provided certain ocxs have been registered using [administrator rights](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/91cf3127-70fe-4726-8a27-31b8964430c5/registering-mscomct2ocx-in-64-bit-windows-7?forum=sbappdev). These are VB6 controls and are not native to VBA environment. To install the  and , we need to set a reference to  which can only be accessed by elevated registration of . Similarly for  and .

Depending on your Windows and Office versions (32 bit or 64 bit), it can be really painful to register these ocxs.

If you include them in your project and distribute them to your friends, neighbours, clients etc the application may or may not work depending on whether they have those ocx installed.

And hence it is highly advisable  to use them in your project



This [calendar, using Userform and Worksheet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12012206/formatting-mm-dd-yyyy-dates-in-textbox-in-vba/12013961#12013961), was suggested earlier and is incredibly basic.

When I saw the Windows 10 calendar which popped up when I clicked on the date and time from the system tray, I could not help but wonder if we can replicate that in VBA.

This post is about how to create a calendar  which is not dependant on any ocx or 32bit/64bit and can be freely distributed with your project.

This is what the calendar looks like in Windows 10:

It seems like you're trying to explain how to create a calendar in VBA that doesn't rely on any ocx or 32bit/64bit and can be freely distributed with your project. However, your text seems to be missing some key information. Here's a more complete explanation:

In VBA, you can use three main kinds of date time controls, provided certain OCX files have been registered with administrator rights. These controls are from VB6 and are not native to the VBA environment. To install these controls, you need to set a reference to them, which can only be done by registering the OCX files with elevated privileges. However, depending on your Windows and Office versions (32 bit or 64 bit), it can be challenging to register these OCX files.

The three controls are DTPicker, MonthView, and Calendar. If you include them in your project and distribute it, the application may or may not work depending on whether the recipient has those OCX files installed. Therefore, it's not recommended to use these controls in your project.

Instead, you can create a calendar using a Userform and Worksheet, which is a more basic but reliable method. This calendar can be freely distributed with your project and isn't dependent on any OCX files or specific Windows/Office versions.

You can design this calendar to look and function like the Windows 10 calendar that pops up when you click on the date and time from the system tray. This way, users will have a familiar and intuitive interface to interact with.

It seems like you're trying to explain how to create a calendar in VBA that doesn't depend on any ocx or 32bit/64bit and can be freely distributed with your project. However, your text seems to be missing some key information and context. 

Here's a more complete explanation:

In VBA, there are three main kinds of date time controls that can be used, provided certain OCXs have been registered using administrator rights. These are VB6 controls and are not native to the VBA environment. To install these controls, we need to set a reference to them, which can only be accessed by elevated registration of the OCXs. Depending on your Windows and Office versions (32 bit or 64 bit), it can be challenging to register these OCXs.

The three controls are:

1. DTPicker: This control allows users to select a date and time and to display the date and time with a specified format.

2. MonthView: This control displays a one-month calendar that allows users to select dates and navigate between months.

3. Calendar: This control displays a one-month calendar that allows users to select dates.

However, if you include these controls in your project and distribute them, the application may or may not work depending on whether the recipients have those OCXs installed. Therefore, it's not advisable to use them in your project.

Instead, you can create a calendar using Userform and Worksheet in VBA. This calendar is not dependent on any OCX or 32bit/64bit and can be freely distributed with your project. It's a more reliable and universal solution for adding a calendar to your VBA project.

The calendar you create in VBA can be designed to look and function similarly to the calendar in Windows 10, which pops up when you click on the date and time from the system tray. This provides a familiar and intuitive interface for users.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

It seems like you're trying to explain how to create a calendar in VBA that doesn't depend on any ocx or 32bit/64bit and can be freely distributed with your project, similar to the Windows 10 calendar. However, your message seems to be cut off and incomplete.

Here's a general guide on how you can create a calendar in VBA:

1. **Create a UserForm**: In VBA, go to the "Insert" menu and select "UserForm". This will create a new form where you can add controls.

2. **Add Controls**: From the "Toolbox", drag and drop the "Label", "ComboBox", and "CommandButton" controls onto the form. You'll need 42 labels (for the days), 2 combo boxes (for the month and year), and 4 command buttons (for navigating through the calendar).

3. **Configure the Controls**: Set the properties of the controls to match your desired appearance and functionality. For example, you can set the "Caption" property of the labels to the corresponding day numbers, and the "List" property of the combo boxes to the month names and years.

4. **Write the Code**: In the "Code" window, write the VBA code that will update the calendar based on the selected month and year, and navigate through the calendar when the command buttons are clicked. You can use the "DateSerial" function to get the date for a specific day, month, and year, and the "Weekday" function to get the day of the week.

5. **Test the Calendar**: Run the UserForm to test the calendar. You should be able to select a month and year from the combo boxes, see the corresponding calendar in the labels, and navigate through the calendar with the command buttons.

Remember, this is a basic guide and you might need to adjust it based on your specific needs and preferences.
