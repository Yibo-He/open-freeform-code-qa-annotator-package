I have data in sheet 1. Normally I go to power query and do my transformations, then close, and load to an existing sheet 2.
I would like to automate this using VBA, where I can just run my power query automatically and populate the transformation to sheet 2.
Macro recorder doesn't seem to allow me to record the steps. And there isn't much online about doing this.
Trying some simpler code:
```
Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly()

'Sub LoadToWorksheetOnly(query As WorkbookQuery, currentSheet As Worksheet)
    ' The usual VBA code to create ListObject with a Query Table
    ' The interface is not new, but looks how simple is the conneciton string of Power Query:
    ' "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name
     
    query = Sheets("Sheet6").Range("A1").value 'here is where my query from power query is. I put the text from power query avanced editor in another sheet cell.
    currentSheet = ActiveSheet.Name
    With ActiveSheet.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=0, Source:= _
        "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=$Workbook$;Location=" & query.Name _
        , Destination:=Sheets("target").Range("$A$1")).QueryTable
        .CommandType = xlCmdDefault
        .CommandText = Array("SELECT * FROM [" & query.Name & "]")
        .RowNumbers = False
        .FillAdjacentFormulas = False
        .PreserveFormatting = True
        .RefreshOnFileOpen = False
        .BackgroundQuery = True
        .RefreshStyle = xlInsertDeleteCells
        .SavePassword = False
        .SaveData = True
        .AdjustColumnWidth = True
        .RefreshPeriod = 0
        .PreserveColumnInfo = False
        .Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    End With
     
End Sub
```

Here is my issue when trying to load to new sheet manually.

It looks like you are trying to load data from a Power Query into a new sheet using VBA. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable
    Dim conn As WorkbookConnection
    Dim queryName As String
    
    ' Set variables
    Set wb = ThisWorkbook
    Set ws = wb.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change to the sheet with your data
    queryName = "Query - Sheet1" ' Change to the name of your Power Query
    
    ' Refresh the Power Query
    For Each conn In wb.Connections
        If conn.Name = queryName Then
            conn.Refresh
            Exit For
        End If
    Next conn
    
    ' Load the data into a new sheet
    Set qt = ws.ListObjects(queryName).QueryTable
    qt.Refresh
    Set ws = wb.Sheets.Add(After:=wb.Sheets(wb.Sheets.Count))
    ws.Name = "New Sheet"
    qt.ResultRange.Copy ws.Range("A1")
    
End Sub
```

This code assumes that you have already created a Power Query and named it "Query - Sheet1". It refreshes the query, loads the data into a new sheet named "New Sheet", and copies the result range to the new sheet. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs, such as changing the name of the new sheet or the name of the Power Query.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It looks like you are trying to use VBA to load data from a Power Query into a new worksheet. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim myWorkbook As Workbook
    Dim myWorksheet As Worksheet
    Dim myQuery As WorkbookQuery
    
    ' Set references to workbook and worksheet
    Set myWorkbook = ThisWorkbook
    Set myWorksheet = myWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1")
    
    ' Set reference to Power Query
    Set myQuery = myWorkbook.Queries("MyPowerQuery")
    
    ' Refresh the Power Query
    myQuery.Refresh
    
    ' Load the data into a new worksheet
    myQuery.Result.LoadToWorksheet myWorksheet.Range("A1")
    
End Sub
```

In this code, you first define variables for your workbook, worksheet, and Power Query. Then, you set references to those objects using the `Set` keyword. 

Next, you refresh the Power Query using the `Refresh` method. This ensures that the data is up-to-date before you load it into your worksheet.

Finally, you use the `LoadToWorksheet` method to load the data into a new worksheet. In this example, the data is loaded into cell A1 of Sheet1. You can modify this to fit your specific needs.

Note that this code assumes that you have already created a Power Query and named it "MyPowerQuery". If you have a different name for your query, you will need to modify the code accordingly.

It looks like you are trying to load data from a Power Query into a new sheet using VBA. Here is some sample code that you can modify to fit your specific needs:

```
Sub LoadDataFromPowerQuery()

    ' Define variables
    Dim wb As Workbook
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim qt As QueryTable
    Dim connString As String
    Dim queryName As String
    
    ' Set variables
    Set wb = ThisWorkbook
    Set ws = wb.Sheets("Sheet1") ' Change to the name of your source sheet
    queryName = "Query - Sheet1" ' Change to the name of your Power Query
    
    ' Build connection string
    connString = "OLEDB;Provider=Microsoft.Mashup.OleDb.1;Data Source=" & wb.FullName & ";Location=" & queryName
    
    ' Add QueryTable to new sheet
    Set qt = ws.ListObjects.Add(SourceType:=xlSrcExternal, Source:=Array(connString), Destination:=Range("A1")).QueryTable
    
    ' Refresh QueryTable
    qt.Refresh BackgroundQuery:=False
    
End Sub
```

This code assumes that your Power Query is named "Query - Sheet1" and that you want to load the data into a new sheet. You can modify the code to fit your specific needs by changing the sheet names and query names.
