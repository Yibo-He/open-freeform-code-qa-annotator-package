In Bash scripts, I frequently find this pattern useful, where I first print the command I'm about to execute, then I execute the command:
```
echo 'Running this cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces'
ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"

echo 'Running this cmd: df -h'
df -h

# etc.
```

Notice the  in the `echo` command to prevent variable expansion there! The idea is that I want to print the cmd I'm running, , then run it!
How do I wrap this up into a function?
Wrapping the command up into a standard bash array, and then printing and calling it, like this,  works:
```
# Print and run the passed-in command
# USAGE:
#       cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
#       print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
# See:
# 1. My answer on how to pass regular "indexed" and associative arrays by reference:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060036/4561887 and
# 1. My answer on how to pass associative arrays: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060913/4561887
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    echo "Running cmd:  ${cmd_array[@]}"
    # run the command by calling all elements of the command array at once
    ${cmd_array[@]}
}
```

For simple commands like this it works fine:
Usage:
```
cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Output:
```
Running cmd:  ls -a -l -F /
(all output of that cmd is here)
```

But for more-complicated commands it is broken!:
Usage:
```
cmd_array=(ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces")
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Desired output:
```
Running cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
(all output of that command should be here)
```

Actual Output:
```
Running cmd:  ls -1 /home/gabriel/temp/some folder with spaces
ls: cannot access '/home/gabriel/temp/some': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'folder': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'with': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'spaces': No such file or directory
```

The , as you can see, is that `$HOME` got expanded in the `Running cmd:` line, when it shouldn't have, and the double quotes around that path argument were removed, and the  is that the command doesn't actually run.

If you've got Bash version 4.4 or later, this function may do what you want:
```
function print_and_run_cmd
{
    local PS4='Running cmd: '
    local -
    set -o xtrace

    "$@"
}
```

For example, running
```
print_and_run_cmd echo 'Hello World!'
```

outputs
```
Running cmd: echo 'Hello World!'
Hello World!
```

- `local PS4='Running cmd: '` sets a prefix for commands printed by the shell when the `xtrace` option is on.  The default is `+`.  Localizing it means that the previous value of `PS4` is automatically restored when the function returns.- `local -` causes any changes to shell options to be reverted automatically when the function returns.  In particular, it causes the `set -o xtrace` on the next line to be automatically undone when the function returns.  Support for `local -` was added in Bash 4.4.From `man bash`, under the `local [option] [name[=value] ... | - ]` section (emphasis added):> If name is `-`, the set of shell options is made local to the function in which local is invoked: `set`- `set -o xtrace` (which is equivalent to `set -x`) causes the shell to print  commands, preceded by the expanded value of `PS4`, before running them.See `help set`.

Check your scripts with [shellcheck](https://www.shellcheck.net/):
```
Line 2:
    local -n array_reference="$1"
             ^-- SC2034 (warning): array_reference appears unused. Verify use (or export if used externally).
 
Line 3:
    echo "Running cmd:  ${cmd_array[@]}"
                        ^-- SC2145 (error): Argument mixes string and array. Use * or separate argument.
                        ^-- SC2154 (warning): cmd_array is referenced but not assigned.
 
Line 5:
    ${cmd_array[@]}
    ^-- SC2068 (error): Double quote array expansions to avoid re-splitting elements.
```

You might want to research [https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2068](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/wiki/SC2068) . We fix all errors and we get:
```
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    echo "Running cmd:  ${array_reference[*]}"
    # run the command by calling all elements of the command array at once
    "${array_reference[@]}"
}
```

For me it's odd to pass an array by reference in this case. I would pass the actual values. I often do:
```
prun() {
   # in the style of set -x
   # print to stderr, so output can be captured
   echo "+ $*" >&2
   # or echo "+ ${*@Q}" >&2
   # or echo "+$(printf " %q" "$@")" >&2
   # or echo "+$(/bin/printf " %q" "$@")" >&2
   "$@"
}
prun "${cmd_array[@]}"
```

> How do I fix these 2 problems?
Incorporate into your workflow linters, formatters and static analysis tools, like shellcheck, and check the problems they point out.
And quote variable expansion. It's `"${array[@]}"`.

You can achieve what you want with DEBUG trap :
```
#!/bin/bash
 
set -T
trap 'test "$FUNCNAME" = print_and_run_cmd || trap_saved_command="${BASH_COMMAND}"' DEBUG
print_and_run_cmd(){
    echo "Running this cmd: ${trap_saved_command#* }"
    "$@"
}
outer(){
    print_and_run_cmd ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
}
outer
# output ->
# Running this cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
# ...
```

I really like [@pjh's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/71151669/4561887), so I've marked it as correct. It doesn't fully answer my original question though, so if another answer comes along that does, I may have to change that. `man bash``help set`
I'd like to change the formatting and provide some more examples, however, to show that variable expansion does take place within the command. I'd also like to provide one version which passes by reference, and one which does not, so you can choose the call style which you like best.
Here are my examples, showing both call styles (`print_and_run1 cmd_array` and `print_and_run2 "${cmd_array[@]}"`):
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Print and run the passed-in command, which is passed in as an 
# array **by reference**.
# See here for a full explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71151669/4561887
# USAGE:
#       cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
#       print_and_run1 cmd_array
print_and_run1() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    local PS4='Running cmd:  '
    local -
    set -o xtrace
    # Call the cmd
    "${array_reference[@]}"
}

# Print and run the passed-in command, which is passed in as members
# of an array **by value**.
# See here for a full explanation: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71151669/4561887
# USAGE:
#       cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
#       print_and_run2 "${cmd_array[@]}"
print_and_run2() {
    local PS4='Running cmd:  '
    local -
    set -o xtrace
    # Call the cmd
    "$@"
}

cmd_array=(ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces")

print_and_run1 cmd_array
echo ""
print_and_run2 "${cmd_array[@]}"
echo ""
```

Sample run and output:
```
eRCaGuy_hello_world/bash$ ./print_and_run.sh 
Running cmd:  ls -1 '/home/gabriel/temp/some folder with spaces'
file1.txt
file2.txt

Running cmd:  ls -1 '/home/gabriel/temp/some folder with spaces'
file1.txt
file2.txt
```

This seems to work too:
```
print_and_run_cmd() {
    echo "Running cmd:  $1"
    eval "$cmd"
}

cmd='ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"'
print_and_run_cmd "$cmd"
```

Output:
```
Running cmd:  ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
(result of running the cmd is here)
```

But now the problem is, if I want to print an  version of the cmd too, to verify that part worked properly, I can't, or at least, don't know how.
