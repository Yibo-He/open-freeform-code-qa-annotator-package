The [Windows Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) app is advertised as a central hub for all terminal work, so I'm interested in a way to bring my SSH connections into it and replace ancient PuTTY.

Absolutely, you can use Windows Terminal to manage your SSH connections. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Install Windows Terminal**: You can download and install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store or from the GitHub releases page.

2. **Install OpenSSH Client**: OpenSSH client is a part of Windows 10 (1809 and later) and it's installed by default. If you don't have it installed, you can add it manually. Go to Settings -> Apps -> Apps & Features -> Optional Features -> Add a Feature -> OpenSSH Client -> Install.

3. **Create SSH Connection**: Open your terminal and test your SSH connection by typing `ssh user@hostname` (replace "user" with your username and "hostname" with the IP address or hostname of the SSH server you want to connect to).

4. **Add SSH Connection to Windows Terminal Profile**: Windows Terminal uses a file called `settings.json` to store its settings. You can access this file by opening Windows Terminal and clicking on the down arrow in the title bar, then select "Settings". This will open the `settings.json` file in your default JSON editor.

5. In the `settings.json` file, you'll see a list of profiles for each terminal shell. You can add a new profile for your SSH connection in the "list" array. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "guid": "{07b52e3e-de2c-5db4-bd2d-ba144ed6c273}",
    "hidden": false,
    "name": "My SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh user@hostname",
    "icon": "path-to-your-icon"
}
```

Replace "user" and "hostname" with your SSH username and hostname. Replace "path-to-your-icon" with the path to the icon you want to use for this profile. The "guid" is a unique identifier for the profile, you can generate a new one using an online GUID generator.

6. Save the `settings.json` file and close it. Now, when you open Windows Terminal, you'll see "My SSH Connection" in the dropdown menu. Click on it to start an SSH session.

Remember, you'll need to replace "user@hostname" with your actual username and the hostname of the machine you're trying to connect to. If you need to connect to different machines, you can create multiple profiles, each with their own unique GUID and commandline.

Sure, you can definitely use Windows Terminal for SSH connections. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Install Windows Terminal**: If you haven't already, install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store or from the GitHub releases page.

2. **Install OpenSSH Client**: Windows 10 (1809 and later) includes an OpenSSH client, which is used to make SSH connections. You can install it by going to "Settings" > "Apps" > "Apps & Features" > "Optional Features" > "Add a Feature" > "OpenSSH Client".

3. **Configure SSH Connections**: You can configure SSH connections by creating a config file. Open a text editor (like Notepad), and create a new file with the following content:

    ```
    Host alias
        HostName server-ip-or-domain
        User username
        Port port-number
    ```

    Replace `alias` with a name you want to use for the connection, `server-ip-or-domain` with the IP address or domain of the server, `username` with your username on the server, and `port-number` with the port number (usually 22 for SSH).

    Save the file as `config` (without any extension) in the `.ssh` directory in your user's home directory (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\.ssh\config`).

4. **Add SSH Connection to Windows Terminal**: Open Windows Terminal, and click on the down arrow in the title bar, then select "Settings". This will open the `settings.json` file in a text editor.

    Add a new profile for the SSH connection in the `profiles` > `list` array:

    ```json
    {
        "guid": "{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}",
        "hidden": false,
        "name": "SSH Connection",
        "commandline": "ssh alias",
        "icon": "ms-appx:///ProfileIcons/{61c54bbd-c2c6-5271-96e7-009a87ff44bf}.png"
    }
    ```

    Replace `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000` with a new GUID (you can generate one online), `SSH Connection` with the name you want to display in Windows Terminal, and `alias` with the alias you used in the SSH config file.

    Save the `settings.json` file and close the text editor.

5. **Use SSH Connection**: Now, when you open Windows Terminal, you can select the SSH connection from the drop-down menu in the title bar, and it will start an SSH session to the server.

Remember, you need to have the private key for the SSH connection in the `.ssh` directory in your user's home directory (the same directory where the `config` file is). If the private key is not there or is not named `id_rsa`, you can specify the path to it in the SSH config file with the `IdentityFile` option:

```
Host alias
    HostName server-ip-or-domain
    User username
    Port port-number
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/your-private-key
```

Sure, you can definitely use Windows Terminal for SSH connections. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do it:

1. **Install Windows Terminal**: If you haven't already, install Windows Terminal from the Microsoft Store or from the GitHub releases page.

2. **Install OpenSSH Client**: OpenSSH client is a part of Windows 10 (1809 and later) and it's an optional feature. To install it, go to "Manage optional features" from Windows Settings -> Apps & Features -> Optional Features -> Add a feature -> OpenSSH Client -> Install.

3. **Add SSH Connection to Windows Terminal**: Open Windows Terminal and click on the down arrow in title bar, then select "Settings". This will open a JSON file where you can set your preferences for the Terminal.

4. **Add a new profile for your SSH connection**: In the profiles section of the JSON file, you can add a new profile for your SSH connection. Here's an example:

```json
{
    "guid": "{07b52e3e-de2c-5db4-bd2d-ba144ed6c273}",
    "hidden": false,
    "name": "My SSH Connection",
    "commandline": "ssh username@hostname",
    "icon": "C:/Path/To/Your/Icon.png"
}
```

Replace `username@hostname` with your actual username and hostname for the SSH connection. You can also replace the icon path with the path to your preferred icon for this profile.

5. **Save and Restart Windows Terminal**: After you've added your profile, save the JSON file and restart Windows Terminal. You should now see your SSH connection in the drop-down menu of the Terminal.

Now, you can start using Windows Terminal for your SSH connections instead of PuTTY. You can add as many profiles as you want for different SSH connections.
