I have a docker file as below. `launch.sh` is the entry point in this docker image. 

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        vim \
        net-tools \
        git \
        iputils-ping \
        wget

RUN apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ make libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install 7.9.0 && npm install -g npm@5.6.0

ADD ./Docker/launch.sh /workspace/

CMD ["/bin/sh", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


The content of `launch.sh` is:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```


when I run the docker container: `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, I got this error:

```
npm: not found
node: not found
```


The `node` in this image is managed by `nvm` which has been installed and its script has been set on `/root/.bashrc` file. But I don't know why it can't find the nodejs commands. But if I run the container by `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash`, then manually run `workspace/launch.sh` command, everything works fine. It seems the `~/.bashrc` is not executed when run the image. How can I let the container source .bashrc?

The content of `/root/.bashrc` is:

```
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

# If not running interactively, don't do anything

# ... or force ignoredups and ignorespace

The issue is that the `.bashrc` file is not sourced when running the container with `docker run IMAGE_NAME`. You can source the `.bashrc` file manually by adding the following line to your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` script is loaded and the `node` and `npm` commands are available in your container. Your updated `launch.sh` script should look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc
cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Alternatively, you can modify your Dockerfile to include the `source /root/.bashrc` command in the `CMD` instruction. Your updated Dockerfile should look like this:

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        vim \
        net-tools \
        git \
        iputils-ping \
        wget

RUN apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ make libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install 7.9.0 && npm install -g npm@5.6.0

ADD ./Docker/launch.sh /workspace/

CMD ["/bin/bash", "-c", "source /root/.bashrc && /workspace/launch.sh"]
```

This will ensure that the `.bashrc` file is sourced every time the container is started.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can try sourcing the `.bashrc` file in your `launch.sh` script before executing the `node` command. You can add the following line at the beginning of your `launch.sh` script:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` script is loaded and the `node` command is available in the environment. Your updated `launch.sh` script will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc
cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

Save the changes to the `launch.sh` file and rebuild the Docker image. Then, run the Docker container again and see if it resolves the issue.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can try adding the following line to your `launch.sh` script before running `npm` and `node` commands:

```
source /root/.bashrc
```

This will source the `.bashrc` file and load all the environment variables and aliases defined in it. 

So, your updated `launch.sh` script will look like this:

```
#!/bin/bash

source /root/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
``` 

This should solve the issue of not finding `npm` and `node` commands in your Docker container.
