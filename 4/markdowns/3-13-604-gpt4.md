I've recently picked up an Android Studio project I started a year ago in Kotlin.
It features three fragments that can be navigated through by a bottom navigation bar.
Now, to break my current issue down to a simple example that even doesn't work for me:
Given there's a the editText object `exercise` in `fragment_home.xml` and I want to call and alter it in `HomeFragment.kt`.
I checked every source of advice I could find from Google & Stackoverflow and came up with the following code in `HomeFragment.kt` (partially pre-coded by AndroidStudio):
```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        val view: View = inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home,container,false)

        view.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

The last line stands for every object I tried to reach. I also tried onClickListening for buttons like so:
```
val btnNewExercise =  view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {view

            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
```

but nothing happens when I start the app/ hit the buttons - I seem to can't get through to the actual view's objects to access them. Even ran into NullPointerExceptions on my way to a solution.
I could supply the fragment and layout files if needed - just thought this way it might be easier at first.
If anybody could tell me where I'm wrong I'd be really grateful! Thanks in advance!

From your code, it seems you are inflating the layout twice, once for the binding and once for the view. This could be the cause of your issue. 

When you use View Binding, you don't need to inflate the layout again. The binding object already contains all the views in the layout. 

Here's how you should do it:

```kotlin
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }

        return root
}
```

In this code, `binding.exercise` and `binding.btnNewExercise` are the views in your layout. You can access them directly from the binding object. 

Also, make sure that the IDs of the views in your layout file match the ones you are using in your Kotlin file. 

If you still encounter a NullPointerException, it might be because the views are not yet created when you are trying to access them. In that case, you should move the code that accesses the views to `onViewCreated()` method.

From your code, it seems you are inflating your layout twice which is unnecessary and could be the cause of your issue. Once you have inflated your layout using `FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)`, you can access your views directly from the binding object. 

Here's how you can modify your code:

```kotlin
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }

        return root
    }
```

In this code, `binding.exercise` and `binding.btnNewExercise` are the views in your layout. Make sure the ids in your layout file match the ids you are using in your Kotlin code. 

Also, make sure you are not trying to access the views before they are inflated, this could cause a `NullPointerException`. 

If you are still facing issues, please provide the fragment and layout files for further assistance.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

From your code, it seems you are inflating the layout twice which is unnecessary and could be causing the issue. Once you have inflated the layout using `FragmentHomeBinding.inflate()`, you should use the `binding` object to access the views.

Here is how you should do it:

```kotlin
override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater,
    container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    val homeViewModel =
        ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

    _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
    val root: View = binding.root

    binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

    binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
        Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        println("Generated a new exercise")
    }

    return root
}
```

In this code, `binding.exercise` and `binding.btnNewExercise` are used to access the `EditText` and `Button` views respectively. The `requireContext()` function is used to get the context in the `Toast.makeText()` function.

Also, make sure that the ids `exercise` and `btnNewExercise` are correctly set in your `fragment_home.xml` layout file. If the ids are incorrect, you will get a `NullPointerException` when trying to access the views.
