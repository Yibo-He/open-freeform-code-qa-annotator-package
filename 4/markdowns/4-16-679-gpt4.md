I've been successfully using PowerShell and Exchange Online Management module for a long time. First I used the original version and lately I've been using the EXO v2 module. I'm also using MFA and a Global Admin account. We do not use any hybrid environments.
Today suddenly when I tried to connect it just gives me this error (I replaced some ID parts with ####):
> New-ExoPSSession : Processing data from remote server
outlook.office365.com failed with the following error message:
[AuthZRequestId=####][FailureCategory=AuthZ-CmdletAccessDeniedException]
The user "EURPR02A005.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM/Microsoft Exchange Hosted
Organizations/####" isn't assigned to any management roles. For more
information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic. At
C:\Program
Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ExchangeOnlineManagement\2.0.5\netFramework\ExchangeOnlineManagement.psm1:475
char:30- - - 
Also like I said, I'm using a global admin account that has worked like a dream until today and no changes made by me to any roles. The command I've been using to connect is `Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName #### -ShowProgress $true`, where #### is my global admin account. After that I type in the password and accept the MFA notification on my phone. Then it gives the error.
What might be wrong? I'm grateful for any help regarding this problem, thank you!
 It seems many have the same problem at the moment so it could be on Microsoft's end. Thank you all for your answers this far and let's see if Microsoft gets it fixed. I have also opened a ticket with Microsoft but haven't gotten any real solution or information on it yet.
 The problem was on Microsoft's end and it is being fixed (EX280152) or might already be fixed for some (like our organization). I also made this edit as an answer for people who might still come reading about this problem.
Kind regards,
Tenttu

Hello Tenttu,

It seems like you've already identified the issue correctly. The error message you're receiving is typically related to permissions, but as you've mentioned, your account is a Global Admin and you haven't made any changes to the roles. 

This, combined with the fact that many others are experiencing the same issue, strongly suggests that the problem is on Microsoft's end. 

The best course of action in this situation is exactly what you've done: open a ticket with Microsoft. They should be able to provide more information and hopefully a resolution. 

In the meantime, you can monitor the status of the issue (EX280152) on the Microsoft 365 Service Health dashboard. 

I hope the issue gets resolved soon. If you have any other questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.

Best regards.

It appears that you have done a thorough job of troubleshooting and have come to the conclusion that the issue is likely on Microsoft's end. This is further supported by the fact that other users are experiencing the same problem. 

Here are a few additional steps you could take while waiting for a response from Microsoft:

1. **Check the Service Health Dashboard**: This will provide you with any updates on known issues that Microsoft is currently working on. 

2. **Try a Different Account**: If you have another Global Admin account, you could try using that to see if the issue is account-specific.

3. **Reinstall the Exchange Online Management Module**: Sometimes, reinstalling the module can resolve unexpected issues.

4. **Try Connecting from a Different Network**: This can help determine if the issue is related to your network.

5. **Try Connecting from a Different Device**: This can help determine if the issue is related to your device.

Remember to keep monitoring the ticket you opened with Microsoft and update it with any new information you discover during your troubleshooting. 

It's good to hear that Microsoft has acknowledged the issue (EX280152) and is working on a fix. Hopefully, the issue will be resolved soon.

It seems like you've already identified the issue and found that it was on Microsoft's end. This error message usually indicates that the user doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform the operation, but since you're using a Global Admin account and haven't made any changes to the roles, it's unlikely to be the cause in this case.

Microsoft's Exchange Online can occasionally have issues that result in errors like this. It's always a good idea to check the service health dashboard in the Microsoft 365 admin center or the Microsoft 365 status on Twitter to see if there are any known issues.

In your case, it seems like the issue (EX280152) has been identified and is being fixed by Microsoft. If you're still experiencing the problem, you might want to try again later. If the issue persists, you should contact Microsoft support for further assistance.

Remember to keep your Exchange Online Management module updated to the latest version to ensure you have the latest fixes and improvements. You can update it using the `Update-Module -Name ExchangeOnlineManagement` command in PowerShell.

I'm glad to hear that your issue is being resolved. If you have any other questions or run into any other issues, feel free to ask.
