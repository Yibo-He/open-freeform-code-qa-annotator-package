I got an alert when tried to open one provisioned testing build on iOS 16.0.
Alert says -
> "Your App" required Developer Mode to run. Until Developer Mode has been
enabled this app will not be available for use.

This alert is indicating that the app you're trying to open is a developer build, which requires your device to be in Developer Mode to run. Developer Mode is a setting that exposes developer-oriented features that are not visible in normal mode. 

Here's how you can enable Developer Mode on your iOS device:

1. Connect your iOS device to your Mac.
2. Open Xcode on your Mac.
3. Go to Window > Devices and Simulators.
4. Select your device from the list on the left.
5. Check the "Show as run destination" box.

This should enable Developer Mode on your device, allowing you to run the app.

If you're still having trouble, make sure that:

- Your device is properly connected to your Mac.
- You have the latest version of Xcode installed.
- Your device is running a compatible version of iOS.
- You have the necessary permissions to enable Developer Mode on the device.

If you've checked all of these and are still having issues, it may be a problem with the app itself, in which case you should contact the app's developer for further assistance.

This alert typically means that the app you're trying to open is a developer-signed app, and you need to trust the developer on your device before you can use it. Here's how you can enable Developer Mode on your iOS device:

1. Open the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "General."
3. Scroll down to "Device Management" or "Profiles & Device Management."
4. Under the "DEVELOPER APP" section, you should see the developer of the app you're trying to open. Tap on it.
5. You'll see a blue "Trust" button. Tap on it, and when the confirmation alert pops up, tap "Trust" again.

After these steps, you should be able to open and use the app. If the app still doesn't open, it might be because the app is not compatible with iOS 16.0 or there might be an issue with the app's code. In that case, you should contact the developer of the app for further assistance.

This alert is indicating that the app you're trying to open is a developer-signed app, and you need to trust the developer on your device before you can use it. Here's how you can do it:

1. Go to the Settings app on your iOS device.
2. Scroll down and tap on "General".
3. Scroll down to "Device Management" or "Profiles & Device Management". 
4. Under the "Developer App" section, you should see the developer of the app you're trying to open. Tap on it.
5. You'll see a blue "Trust" button. Tap on it, and when the confirmation alert pops up, tap "Trust" again.

After doing this, you should be able to open and use the app. If the problem persists, it might be due to the fact that the app was built with a developer profile that doesn't match the one on your device. In this case, you'll need to get a new build of the app that's signed with the correct developer profile.
