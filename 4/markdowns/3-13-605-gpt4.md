In [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), my client wants email and cardholder name, but the Stripe payment UI doesn't provide that option in `com.stripe.android.view.CardMultilineWidget`. I wanted to give it a try with the latest stripe version,

1. I was using Stripe version (14.1.1). So I updated it to the latest one (16.8.0)
2. The build showed me the error that it doesn't take minSdkVersion 19. It requires 21 in manifest merger. So I updated minSdkVersion to 21.
3. I got caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/4541b0189187e0017d23bbb0afebd16a/jetified-kotlin-stdlib-common-1.5.0.jar!/META-INF/kotlin-stdlib-common.kotlin_module: Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.5.1, expected version is 1.1.15.


I tried changing the Gradle version, but I am still getting the same error. How can I solve the incompatible error and add the email and cardholder name in Stripe?

The error you're encountering is due to a mismatch between the Kotlin version used in your project and the one used in the Stripe SDK. The Stripe SDK version 16.8.0 is compiled with Kotlin 1.5.0, but your project is using an older version of Kotlin.

Here's how you can solve the issue:

1. Update your Kotlin version to match the one used by Stripe. You can do this by changing the Kotlin version in your project's build.gradle file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.0'
    ...
    dependencies {
        ...
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}
```

2. Then, in your app's build.gradle file, update the Kotlin standard library dependency:

```gradle
dependencies {
    ...
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib:$kotlin_version"
}
```

3. Sync your project with the Gradle files.

As for the email and cardholder name, the `CardMultilineWidget` does not support these fields. You will have to create your own EditText fields to capture this information. Here's an example:

```kotlin
val cardholderNameEditText: EditText = findViewById(R.id.cardholderNameEditText)
val emailEditText: EditText = findViewById(R.id.emailEditText)
```

When you create a `PaymentMethodCreateParams.Card` object, you can include the cardholder name:

```kotlin
val card = cardMultilineWidget.card
if (card != null) {
    val cardParams = PaymentMethodCreateParams.Card.Builder()
        .setNumber(card.number)
        .setExpMonth(card.expMonth)
        .setExpYear(card.expYear)
        .setCvc(card.cvc)
        .setName(cardholderNameEditText.text.toString())
        .build()

    val billingDetails = PaymentMethod.BillingDetails.Builder()
        .setEmail(emailEditText.text.toString())
        .build()

    val params = PaymentMethodCreateParams
        .create(cardParams, billingDetails)
}
```

Remember to validate the email and cardholder name before creating the `PaymentMethodCreateParams`.

The error you're seeing is due to a mismatch between the Kotlin version used in your project and the one used in the Stripe SDK. The Stripe SDK version 16.8.0 is compiled with Kotlin 1.5.0, but your project is using an older version of Kotlin.

To fix this, you need to update the Kotlin version in your project. You can do this by updating the version in your project-level build.gradle file:

```gradle
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.0'
    repositories {
        google()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.3"
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
        // NOTE: Do not place your application dependencies here; they belong
        // in the individual module build.gradle files
    }
}
```

After updating the Kotlin version, you should be able to build your project without the error.

As for collecting the email and cardholder name, the `CardMultilineWidget` does not support these fields. You will need to create your own form fields for the email and cardholder name, and then pass these values when creating a `PaymentMethodCreateParams.Card` object.

Here is a simple example:

```kotlin
val card = cardMultilineWidget.card
if (card != null) {
    val billingDetails = PaymentMethod.BillingDetails.Builder()
        .setName(nameEditText.text.toString())
        .setEmail(emailEditText.text.toString())
        .build()

    val paymentMethodParamsCard = PaymentMethodCreateParams.Card.Builder()
        .setNumber(card.number)
        .setCvc(card.cvc)
        .setExpiryMonth(card.expMonth)
        .setExpiryYear(card.expYear)
        .build()

    val paymentMethodParams = PaymentMethodCreateParams
        .create(paymentMethodParamsCard, billingDetails)

    // Use paymentMethodParams for payment
}
```

In this example, `nameEditText` and `emailEditText` are your own form fields for collecting the cardholder name and email.

The error message you're seeing suggests that the version of Kotlin used to compile the Stripe SDK is newer than the one your project is using. 

To fix this, you need to update your Kotlin version to match the one used by Stripe. You can do this by changing the version in your project's build.gradle file. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Open your project-level build.gradle file.
2. Look for the ext.kotlin_version line.
3. Change the version to '1.5.1' or higher.

It should look something like this:

```groovy
ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.1'
```

After you've done this, sync your project with Gradle files and the error should be gone.

As for the email and cardholder name, the `CardMultilineWidget` does not support these fields. You will need to create your own EditText fields for the email and cardholder name. 

Here's a basic example:

```xml
<EditText
    android:id="@+id/email"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:inputType="textEmailAddress"
    android:hint="Email"/>

<EditText
    android:id="@+id/cardholder_name"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"
    android:inputType="textPersonName"
    android:hint="Cardholder Name"/>

<com.stripe.android.view.CardMultilineWidget
    android:id="@+id/card_multiline_widget"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="wrap_content"/>
```

Then in your activity or fragment, you can get the text from these fields like this:

```kotlin
val email = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.email).text.toString()
val cardholderName = findViewById<EditText>(R.id.cardholder_name).text.toString()
```

Remember to validate these fields before processing the payment.
