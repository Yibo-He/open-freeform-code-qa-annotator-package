I've been successfully using PowerShell and Exchange Online Management module for a long time. First I used the original version and lately I've been using the EXO v2 module. I'm also using MFA and a Global Admin account. We do not use any hybrid environments.
Today suddenly when I tried to connect it just gives me this error (I replaced some ID parts with ####):
> New-ExoPSSession : Processing data from remote server
outlook.office365.com failed with the following error message:
[AuthZRequestId=####][FailureCategory=AuthZ-CmdletAccessDeniedException]
The user "EURPR02A005.PROD.OUTLOOK.COM/Microsoft Exchange Hosted
Organizations/####" isn't assigned to any management roles. For more
information, see the about_Remote_Troubleshooting Help topic. At
C:\Program
Files\WindowsPowerShell\Modules\ExchangeOnlineManagement\2.0.5\netFramework\ExchangeOnlineManagement.psm1:475
char:30- - - 
Also like I said, I'm using a global admin account that has worked like a dream until today and no changes made by me to any roles. The command I've been using to connect is `Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName #### -ShowProgress $true`, where #### is my global admin account. After that I type in the password and accept the MFA notification on my phone. Then it gives the error.
What might be wrong? I'm grateful for any help regarding this problem, thank you!
 It seems many have the same problem at the moment so it could be on Microsoft's end. Thank you all for your answers this far and let's see if Microsoft gets it fixed. I have also opened a ticket with Microsoft but haven't gotten any real solution or information on it yet.
 The problem was on Microsoft's end and it is being fixed (EX280152) or might already be fixed for some (like our organization). I also made this edit as an answer for people who might still come reading about this problem.
Kind regards,
Tenttu

Based on the error message you provided, it seems that your global admin account is not assigned to any management roles. This could be due to a recent change in your organization's policies or a temporary issue with Microsoft's servers.

To resolve this issue, you can try assigning the necessary management roles to your global admin account using the Exchange Online Admin Center or PowerShell. Here are the steps to do it using PowerShell:

1. Open PowerShell as an administrator and connect to Exchange Online using the following command:

   `Connect-ExchangeOnline -UserPrincipalName <your admin account>`

2. Once you are connected, run the following command to assign the necessary roles to your admin account:

   `Add-RoleGroupMember -Identity "Organization Management" -Member <your admin account>`

   This command adds your admin account to the "Organization Management" role group, which has all the necessary management roles to manage Exchange Online.

3. After running the command, try connecting to Exchange Online again using the `Connect-ExchangeOnline` command.

If the issue persists, it could be a temporary issue with Microsoft's servers. You can check the Office 365 Service Health Dashboard for any known issues or contact Microsoft support for further assistance.

It seems like the error message is indicating that your global admin account is not assigned to any management roles. This could be due to a recent change in your organization's policies or a technical issue on Microsoft's end. 

You mentioned that you have already opened a ticket with Microsoft, which is a good step. They should be able to provide you with more information and assistance in resolving the issue. 

In the meantime, you could try checking your account's permissions and roles in the Microsoft 365 admin center to see if anything has changed. You could also try using a different global admin account to see if the issue persists. 

It's also worth noting that you mentioned other users experiencing similar issues, which could indicate a wider problem on Microsoft's end. Keep an eye on any updates or notifications from Microsoft regarding this issue.
