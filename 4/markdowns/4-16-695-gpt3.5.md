I just got a MacBook from work and I am using it to build docker images. Usually, the docker build shows the full log (i.e. `ls -la` showing the cwd). Thats at least what I'm used to from my linux machine.
On the macbook however, it only shows a brief overview: (actual console output)

Steps 7 and 15 are supposed to show me the results, but this is just omitted. (I know, its the cached result, but it didn't show up, when  I changed the Dockerfile and rebuild the layer as well).
setting `--progress=plain`  didn't do any good. In fact it just changed the color from purple to white (HideThePainHarold.jpg).
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

On macOS, Docker Desktop uses a different logging driver than on Linux. By default, it uses the `json-file` driver, which only shows a brief overview of the build process.

To see the full log output, you can switch to the `tty` logging driver by adding the `--progress=auto --tty` flags to your `docker build` command. This will show the full log output, including the `ls -la` commands you are expecting.

Here's an example command:

```
docker build --progress=auto --tty -t myimage .
```

Alternatively, you can change the default logging driver in Docker Desktop settings. Open Docker Desktop, go to Preferences > Docker Engine, and add the following line to the JSON configuration:

```
"features": {
    "buildkit": true
},
"registry-mirrors": [],
"debug": true,
"experimental": true,
"metrics-addr": "127.0.0.1:9323",
"experimental": true,
"debug": true,
"log-driver": "local",
"log-opts": {
    "max-size": "10m",
    "max-file": "3"
}
```

Save the changes and restart Docker Desktop. This will switch the logging driver to `local`, which should show the full log output by default.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

On macOS, Docker uses a different logging driver by default, which may not show the full log output. You can try changing the logging driver to `json-file` to see if it shows the full log output. 

To do this, you can add the following flag to your `docker build` command:

```
--log-driver=json-file
```

This will output the logs in a JSON format to the console, which should include the full log output.

Alternatively, you can also try running the `docker build` command with the `--no-cache` flag to force Docker to rebuild the layers and show the full log output. 

```
docker build --no-cache .
```

This should rebuild all the layers from scratch and show the full log output for each step.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

On macOS, Docker Desktop uses a different logging driver than on Linux. By default, Docker Desktop uses the `json-file` logging driver, which does not show the full output of the build process. 

To see the full output of the build process, you can switch to the `tty` logging driver by adding the `--progress=auto --tty` flags to your `docker build` command. This will enable the full output of the build process to be displayed in your terminal.

Here's an example command:

```
docker build --progress=auto --tty -t myimage .
```

This should show you the full output of the build process, including the `ls -la` commands you were missing.
