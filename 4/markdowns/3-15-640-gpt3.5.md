I have a workbook that was saved yesterday afternoon, and was working perfectly. I have opened it this morning, and none of the modules in the VBE are 'found'. Visually I can see them all sitting there.

When trying to open any of these modules to edit the code, the windows are greyed out, as below.

When I try exporting the code modules, I get the 'Module Not Found' errror.

Does anyone know a) why this has happened, and b) how can I fix this?
I thought initially it was the instance of my Excel, so have restarted the PC.
Any help is appreciated!

It seems like the VBA project in your workbook has become corrupted. This can happen due to various reasons, such as a sudden power outage or a virus infection.

Here are a few things you can try to fix this issue:

1. Open the workbook in a different version of Excel: Sometimes, the issue can be caused by a compatibility issue between the workbook and the version of Excel you are using. Try opening the workbook in a different version of Excel to see if the issue persists.

2. Use a backup copy: If you have a backup copy of the workbook, try opening it to see if the VBA project is intact. If it is, you can copy the VBA code from the backup copy and paste it into the corrupted workbook.

3. Use a VBA recovery tool: There are several third-party tools available that can help recover a corrupted VBA project. You can try using one of these tools to see if it can recover your code.

4. Recreate the VBA project: If all else fails, you may need to recreate the VBA project from scratch. This can be time-consuming, but it will ensure that your code is free from any corruption.

It's always a good idea to make regular backups of your workbooks to avoid losing important data.

It seems like the VBA project may have become corrupted. Here are a few steps you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make a backup copy of the workbook before proceeding with any of the following steps.

2. Try opening the workbook in a different version of Excel. Sometimes, the issue may be related to a compatibility issue between the workbook and the version of Excel you are using.

3. Try opening the workbook in safe mode. To do this, hold down the Ctrl key while opening Excel. This will prevent any add-ins or macros from running, which may be causing the issue.

4. Try exporting the modules to a new workbook. To do this, open a new workbook and go to the VBE. From there, select the module you want to export, right-click, and select "Export File". Save the module to a new workbook and see if you can open it there.

5. If none of the above steps work, you may need to recreate the VBA project. To do this, go to the VBE and select "Tools" > "References". Uncheck any references that are not needed and then save and close the workbook. Reopen the workbook and re-add the necessary references.

If none of these steps work, you may need to seek further assistance from a VBA expert or Microsoft support.

It sounds like the VBA project may have become corrupted. Here are a few steps you can try to fix the issue:

1. Make a backup copy of your workbook before proceeding.
2. Try opening the workbook on a different computer to see if the issue persists.
3. Open a new workbook and import the modules from the corrupted workbook. To do this, go to the VBE, right-click on the project, and select "Import File." Select the module you want to import and repeat for all modules.
4. If the above steps don't work, you can try exporting all the modules to a text file, then deleting the VBA project and re-importing the modules. To export the modules, go to the VBE, select the project, and go to File > Export. Save the file as a text file. Then, delete the VBA project by right-clicking on it and selecting "Remove." Finally, re-import the modules by going to File > Import File and selecting the text file you exported earlier.

Hopefully one of these steps will help you fix the issue.
