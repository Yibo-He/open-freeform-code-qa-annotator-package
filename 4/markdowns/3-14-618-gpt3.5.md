Been playing around with SwiftUI and understood the concept of `BindableObjects` etc so far (at least I hope I do). 

I bumped into a stupid problem I can't seem to find an answer for: 
How do you initialize a `@Binding` variable?

I have the following code:

```
struct LoggedInView : View {

    @Binding var dismissView: Bool

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}
```


In my preview code, I want to pass that parameter of type `Binding<Bool>`:

```
#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: **Binding<Bool>**)
    }
}
#endif
```


How would I go an initialize it? tried:

```
Binding<Bool>.init(false)
Binding<Bool>(false)
```


Or even:

```
@Binding var dismissView: Bool = false
```


But none worked... any ideas?

To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a `Bool` variable that is marked with `@State` in the parent view. Here's an example:

```
struct ParentView: View {
    @State var dismissView = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $dismissView)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In this example, the `ParentView` has a `@State` variable called `dismissView` that is passed as a reference to the `LoggedInView` using the `$` symbol to create a `Binding`. In the preview, you can use the `.constant` method to create a `Binding` to a constant value.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a `Bool` variable that will be used as the source of truth for the binding. Here's an example:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isDismissed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $isDismissed)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In the above example, we initialize the `isDismissed` variable as a `@State` variable in the `ContentView`. We then pass in a reference to this variable using the `$` symbol to create a binding to it in the `LoggedInView`. 

In the preview code, we use the `.constant` method to create a constant binding to `false`. This is because we cannot use a `@State` variable in the preview code.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To initialize a `@Binding` variable, you need to pass in a reference to a variable that can be modified by the parent view. Here's an example:

```
struct ContentView: View {
    @State var isDismissed = false
    
    var body: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: $isDismissed)
    }
}

struct LoggedInView : View {
    @Binding var dismissView: Bool
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
}

#if DEBUG
struct LoggedInView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        LoggedInView(dismissView: .constant(false))
    }
}
#endif
```

In this example, the `ContentView` initializes a `@State` variable called `isDismissed`. It then passes a reference to this variable to the `LoggedInView` using the `$` syntax to create a `Binding` to the variable. 

In the preview code, you can use the `.constant` method to create a `Binding` to a constant value. In this case, we're passing in `false` as the constant value. 

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
