[This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14676852/7437143) explains that normally a git commit SHA is generated based on various parameters. However, I would like to know: 
For example, suppose one wants to create and push a commit to Git with the following sha:
```
1e23456ffd118db9dc04caf40a442040e5ec99f9
```

(For simplicity, assume one can assume it is a unique sha).
The XY-problem is a manual mirror script between two different Git servers. It would be more convenient to simply have identical commit SHA's than to keep a mapping of the commits between the Git servers. This is because the manual mirror is more efficient (saving computation time and server bandwidth) if I can skip certain commits from the `source` server. Yet that means the parent commits change in the `target` server, with respect to the same commit in the `source` server. In turn, that would imply the SHA changes, which would require me to keep track of a mapping of the sha's in the `source` and `target` server. In short, it would be more convenient to simply override the sha's of the commits to the `target` server, than to ensure the two servers have the exact same commits (for the few commits that are actually mirrored).

The short answer is, you can't manually set a commit SHA in Git. The SHA is a hash of the commit's content and metadata, including the author, committer, date, and parent commit(s). If any of these change, the SHA changes. This is by design: the SHA serves as a unique identifier for the commit and its context in the repository's history.

If you could manually set the SHA, it would defeat the purpose of having it. You could have two completely different commits with the same SHA, which would cause all sorts of problems. Git uses the SHA to track commits, to check for changes, and to ensure the integrity of your repository. If you could manually set the SHA, all of these would be compromised.

As for your XY problem, it sounds like you're trying to mirror a repository but skip certain commits. This is a non-trivial problem, because Git is designed to track the entire history of your project. If you skip a commit, you're effectively creating a new history, which will have different SHAs.

One possible solution would be to use `git cherry-pick` to selectively apply commits from the source repository to the target repository. This would allow you to skip certain commits, but it would still result in different SHAs, because the parent commit(s) would be different.

Another solution might be to use `git rebase` to rewrite the history of the source repository before mirroring it to the target repository. This would allow you to remove or modify certain commits, but again, it would result in different SHAs.

In both cases, you would need to keep track of which commits in the source repository correspond to which commits in the target repository. This could be done with a simple mapping file, or by tagging the commits in the source repository with a unique identifier that can be used to find the corresponding commit in the target repository.

In conclusion, while it's understandable that you might want to manually set the SHA for convenience, it's not possible due to the way Git is designed. You'll need to find a different solution for your mirroring problem.

The SHA-1 hash in Git is computed based on the content of the commit, which includes the commit message, author, date, and the content of the repository at that point. This means that even a small change in any of these will result in a completely different SHA-1 hash. 

Therefore, it's not possible to manually set or override the SHA-1 hash of a commit. The hash is a result of the commit and not something that can be arbitrarily set. This is by design, as it ensures the integrity of the commit history in Git.

If you want to keep two Git repositories in sync, the usual way to do it is to simply push the same commits to both repositories. If you want to skip certain commits, you could create a new branch and cherry-pick the commits you want, then push that branch to the other repository. 

However, this will result in different commit hashes if the parent commits are not the same. If you need to maintain a mapping between commits in the two repositories, you will have to do this manually.

Another approach could be to use `git bundle` to create a bundle of the commits you want to transfer, then apply this bundle on the other repository. This will keep the commit hashes the same, but it requires that the repositories are identical up to the point where you start creating bundles.

In conclusion, there is no way to manually set a commit's SHA in Git. You'll need to find a different solution to your problem.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The SHA-1 hash in Git is computed based on the commit content and metadata, which includes the commit message, author, date, and the tree of the commit (which includes the content of the repository at that point). This means that if any of these change, the SHA-1 hash will also change. 

Unfortunately, Git does not provide a way to manually specify the SHA-1 hash of a commit. The hash is always computed based on the commit content and metadata. This is a fundamental aspect of how Git ensures the integrity of the repository history.

If you need to keep track of corresponding commits between two repositories, you might consider including a reference to the original commit SHA-1 hash in the commit message of the mirrored commit. This would allow you to easily find the corresponding commit in the other repository.

However, if you're trying to mirror repositories, you might want to consider using Git's built-in capabilities for this, such as `git clone --mirror` or `git push --mirror`, which are designed to create an exact copy of the source repository, including all branches, tags, and commits. This would ensure that the SHA-1 hashes of the commits are the same in both repositories. 

If you need more control over which commits are mirrored, you could use a combination of `git fetch` and `git push` to manually fetch and push individual branches or commits. This would require more work to set up and maintain, but it would give you the flexibility to mirror only the commits you want.
