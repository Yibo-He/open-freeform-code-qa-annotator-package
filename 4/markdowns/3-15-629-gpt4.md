I have an ms access vba code from which i wish to copy some text value to the Windows clipboard so that I can paste it elsewhere (Word/Excel/Notepad/etc).
I have been searching for this in SO but everything seems over-complicated.
Should it not be something simple like
clipboard.SetText textValue
?
EDIT
I tried following the hint by BrianMStafford but don't succeed. Perhaps the reason is that my object is a node in a tree.
When I do
> MsgBox Me.NodeKey.Value
it all works fine - I see the node path in the message box.

But when I do
> Me.NodeKey.SetFocus
DoCmd.RunCommand acCmdCopy
I don't get the node path in the clipboard
So how can I copy the node path value into the Windows clipboard?

In MS Access VBA, you can use the Windows API to copy text to the clipboard. Here's how you can do it:

1. First, you need to declare the necessary API functions. You can put these declarations at the top of your module:

```vba
Declare Function OpenClipboard Lib "User32" (ByVal hwnd As Long) As Long
Declare Function CloseClipboard Lib "User32" () As Long
Declare Function EmptyClipboard Lib "User32" () As Long
Declare Function lstrcpy Lib "kernel32" (ByVal lpString1 As Any, ByVal lpString2 As Any) As Long
Declare Function SetClipboardData Lib "User32" (ByVal wFormat As Long, ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Declare Function GlobalAlloc Lib "kernel32" (ByVal wFlags As Long, ByVal dwBytes As Long) As Long
Declare Function GlobalLock Lib "kernel32" (ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Declare Function GlobalUnlock Lib "kernel32" (ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Declare Function GlobalSize Lib "Kernel32" (ByVal hMem As Long) As Long
Public Const GHND = &H42
Public Const CF_TEXT = 1
Public Const MAXSIZE = 4096
```

2. Then, you can create a function to copy text to the clipboard:

```vba
Public Sub ClipBoard_SetData(MyString As String)
    Dim hGlobalMemory As Long, lpGlobalMemory As Long
    Dim hClipMemory As Long, X As Long

    ' Allocate moveable global memory.
    '-------------------------------------------
    hGlobalMemory = GlobalAlloc(GHND, Len(MyString) + 1)

    ' Lock the block to get a far pointer
    ' to this memory.
    lpGlobalMemory = GlobalLock(hGlobalMemory)

    ' Copy the string to this global memory.
    lpGlobalMemory = lstrcpy(lpGlobalMemory, MyString)

    ' Unlock the memory.
    If GlobalUnlock(hGlobalMemory) <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not unlock memory location. Copy aborted."
        GoTo OutOfHere2
    End If

    ' Open the Clipboard to copy data to.
    If OpenClipboard(0&) = 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not open the Clipboard. Copy aborted."
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Clear the Clipboard.
    X = EmptyClipboard()

    ' Copy the data to the Clipboard.
    hClipMemory = SetClipboardData(CF_TEXT, hGlobalMemory)

OutOfHere2:
    If CloseClipboard() = 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not close Clipboard."
    End If
End Sub
```

3. Now, you can use this function to copy your node path to the clipboard:

```vba
ClipBoard_SetData Me.NodeKey.Value
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard, and you can paste it anywhere you want.

Declare Function GlobalSize Lib "kernel32" (ByVal hMem As Long) As Long

Public Const GHND = &H42
Public Const CF_TEXT = 1
Public Const MAXSIZE = 4096
```

    Dim hClipMemory As Long, X As Long

    ' Allocate moveable global memory.
    '-------------------------------------------
    hGlobalMemory = GlobalAlloc(GHND, Len(MyString) + 1)

    ' Lock the block to get a far pointer

    lpGlobalMemory = GlobalLock(hGlobalMemory)

    ' Copy the string to this global memory.
    lpGlobalMemory = lstrcpy(lpGlobalMemory, MyString)

    ' Unlock the memory.
    If GlobalUnlock(hGlobalMemory) <> 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not unlock memory location. Copy aborted."
        GoTo OutOfHere2
    End If

    ' Open the Clipboard to copy data to.
    If OpenClipboard(0&) = 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not open the Clipboard. Copy aborted."
        Exit Sub
    End If

    ' Clear the Clipboard.
    X = EmptyClipboard()

    ' Copy the data to the Clipboard.
    hClipMemory = SetClipboardData(CF_TEXT, hGlobalMemory)

OutOfHere2:
    If CloseClipboard() = 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not close Clipboard."
    End If
End Sub
```

You can use it like this:

```vba
ClipBoard_SetData Me.NodeKey.Value
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.

OutOfHere2:
    If CloseClipboard() = 0 Then
        MsgBox "Could not close Clipboard."
    End If
End Sub
```

You can use this function to copy the node path to the clipboard like this:

```vba
ClipBoard_SetData Me.NodeKey.Value
```

This will copy the value of `Me.NodeKey.Value` to the clipboard.
