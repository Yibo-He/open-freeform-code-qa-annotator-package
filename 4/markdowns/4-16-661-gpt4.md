I am trying to store the value of sql query output in a variable using shell script.
```
size=`${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
select owner, sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX' group by owner;
exit;
EOF`
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

The output I am getting is
```
**Total data is**

Inside the variable full connection string and sql query output all are getting stored. I just want to get value like  Please tell me how to get that

The output you're getting is because the SQLPlus command is returning all the output including the connection details, SQL prompt, and the query result. 

To get only the result of the query, you can use the `-s` option in SQLPlus which stands for silent mode. This will suppress the display of SQLPlus banner, prompts, and echoing of commands.

Also, you need to set the `feedback off` and `heading off` to avoid column names and other feedback messages.

Here is the updated script:

```bash
size=`${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -s $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
set feedback off;
set heading off;
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF`
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

This script will return only the result of the query. Please replace `'XXXX'` with the actual owner name.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The output you're getting is because the SQL*Plus command is also printing the connection and disconnection messages, along with the result of your query. You can suppress these messages by using the `-s` option with SQL*Plus, which runs it in silent mode.

Also, to get only the value of the size, you can use the `awk` command to filter out the required line. Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -s $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT << EOF
SET PAGESIZE 0 FEEDBACK OFF VERIFY OFF HEADING OFF ECHO OFF
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX' group by owner;
exit;
EOF
)
size=$(echo $size | awk '{print $NF}')
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

In this script, `SET PAGESIZE 0 FEEDBACK OFF VERIFY OFF HEADING OFF ECHO OFF` is used to turn off all the unnecessary output from SQL*Plus. The `awk '{print $NF}'` command prints the last field of the last line of the output, which should be the size value you're interested in.

--------

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The output you're seeing is the standard output from the SQL*Plus client, which includes the connection messages, SQL prompt, and other information. If you want to capture only the result of the SQL query, you can modify your SQL*Plus command to use the `-s` (silent) option, which suppresses the SQL*Plus banner and prompts. Also, you can use `SET PAGESIZE 0 FEEDBACK OFF VERIFY OFF HEADING OFF ECHO OFF` to suppress other unnecessary output.

Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
size=`${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -s $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT << EOF
SET PAGESIZE 0 FEEDBACK OFF VERIFY OFF HEADING OFF ECHO OFF
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF`
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

This will suppress all the SQL*Plus messages and prompts, and the `SET` command will suppress other unnecessary output. The result of the SQL query will be the only thing printed to standard output, so it will be the only thing captured in the `size` variable.
