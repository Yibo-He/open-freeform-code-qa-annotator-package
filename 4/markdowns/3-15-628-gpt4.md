Im using [VBA code to create multiple selection drop down list](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64261013/multiple-selection-dropdown-list-in-excel). The code will make each drop down list in target cell become multuple selection list with function:
`If Target.SpecialCells(xlCellTypeAllValidation) Is Nothing Then GoTo Exitsub`
The source of drop down list in target cell is `=indirect(b14)`, and b14 is another drop down list (single selection). Now if b14's value will become list1, Id like to make my target's cell list become multiple selection list. In any other case I want it work in normal excel way. I've tried to precache the list source with `if Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1) = "=list1" then`
but I get mismatch error for `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)`.
How can I do it?
EDIT:
There are some example screenshots from my worksheet, not to misunderstand it's construction.

A1:A5 named range list1, B1:B5 named range list2, B14 data validation list =list1

D14 data validation list with =INDIRECT(B14) formula

The issue you're facing is likely due to the fact that `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` is trying to evaluate the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)`, which is a reference to a cell, not a named range. 

To solve this, you need to evaluate the cell that `INDIRECT(B14)` is referring to, and then compare that to `"list1"`. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)

If rng.Value = "list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

This code first evaluates the `INDIRECT` formula to get the range that it's referring to, and then compares the value of that range to `"list1"`. If they are equal, it executes your code.

Please note that this code assumes that `B14` contains the name of a named range (like `"list1"`). If `B14` contains a cell reference (like `"A1"`), you'll need to adjust the code accordingly.

Also, please be aware that this code will only work if the cell that `B14` is referring to contains a single value. If it contains an array of values, you'll need to use a loop to compare each value to `"list1"`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The Evaluate function is causing a mismatch error because it's trying to evaluate the formula "=list1", which is not a valid Excel formula. It's a named range, not a formula.

Instead of using Evaluate, you can directly compare the Formula1 property to the string "=list1". Here's how you can modify your code:

```vba
If Target.Validation.Formula1 = "=list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

However, please note that the Formula1 property returns the formula exactly as it appears in the Data Validation dialog box. So if your formula is "=INDIRECT(B14)", then you should compare it to that string, not "=list1". Here's how you can do it:

```vba
If Target.Validation.Formula1 = "=INDIRECT(B14)" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

If you want to check if B14 equals to "list1", you can do it like this:

```vba
If Range("B14").Value = "list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

So, in your case, you can use the following code:

```vba
If Not Intersect(Target, Range("D14")) Is Nothing Then
    If Range("B14").Value = "list1" Then
        ' Your code here for multiple selection
    Else
        ' Your code here for single selection
    End If
End If
```

This code will check if the changed cell is D14, and if the value in B14 is "list1". If so, it will execute the code for multiple selection, otherwise it will execute the code for single selection.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're facing is due to the fact that `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` is trying to evaluate the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)`, which is a reference to a cell, not a value. 

To solve this, you need to first evaluate the cell reference `B14` to get the value it contains, and then compare that value to `"list1"`. Here's how you can do it:

```vba
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)

If rng.Value = "list1" Then
    ' Your code here
End If
```

This code first evaluates the formula `=INDIRECT(B14)` to get the range it refers to, then gets the value of that range, and finally compares it to `"list1"`.

However, you should be aware that this code will only work if `B14` contains a valid cell reference. If `B14` contains an error value or a value that is not a valid cell reference, `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)` will raise an error. To handle this, you can use error handling code like this:

```vba
On Error Resume Next
Dim rng As Range
Set rng = Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)
On Error GoTo 0

If Not rng Is Nothing Then
    If rng.Value = "list1" Then
        ' Your code here
    End If
End If
```

This code will ignore any errors raised by `Evaluate(Target.Validation.Formula1)`, and if no error is raised, it will proceed to compare the value of the range to `"list1"`. If an error is raised, `rng` will be `Nothing`, and the comparison will be skipped.
