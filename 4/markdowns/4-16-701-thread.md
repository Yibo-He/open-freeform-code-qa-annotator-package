How can I tell if a specified folder is in my PATH using PowerShell?
A function like this would be great:
```
function FolderIsInPATH($Path_to_directory) {
    # If the directory is in PATH, return true, otherwise false
}
```

[Going off this question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5114985/echo-path-on-separate-lines), you don't need a function for this but can retrieve this with [$Env:Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_environment_variables):
```
$Env:Path -split ";" -contains $directory
```

The [-contains](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_comparison_operators#containment-operators) operator is case-insensitive which is a bonus. It could be useful placing this in a function to ensure trailing slashes are trimmed, but that's uncommon:
```
function inPath($directory) {
    return ($Env:Path -split ';').TrimEnd('\') -contains $directory.TrimEnd('\')
}
```

There's a bunch of answers that do a `$path.Split(";")` or `$path -split ";"` that will probably be fine for 99.9% of real-world scenarios,  there's a comment on [the accepted answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5115119/3156906) on a similar question here [by Joey](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5114985/echo-path-on-separate-lines/5115119#comment5746924_5115119) that says:
> Will fail with quoted paths that contain semicolons.
Basically, it's a bit of an edge case, but this is a perfectly valid `PATH` on Windows:
```
c:\temp;"c:\my ; path";c:\windows
```

so here's a hot mess of code to address that...
```
function Test-IsInPath
{
    param( [string] $Path, [string] $Folder )

    # we're going to treat the path as a csv record, but we
    # need to know how many columns there are so we can create
    # some fake header names. this might give a higher count
    # than the real value if there *are* quoted folders with
    # semicolons in them, but that's not really an issue
    $columnCount = $Path.Length - $Path.Replace(";","").Length

    # generate the list of column names. the actual names
    # don't matter - it's just so ConvertFrom-Csv treats our
    # PATH as a data row instead of a header row
    $headers = 0..$columnCount

    # parse the PATH as a csv record using ";" as a delimiter
    $obj = $path | ConvertFrom-Csv -header $headers -delimiter ";"

    # extract an array of all the values (i.e. folders)
    # in the record we just parsed
    $entries = $obj.psobject.properties.value

    # check if the folder we're looking for is in the list
    return $entries.Contains($Folder)

}
```

Whether this is a "better" answer than the simple `split` approach depends on whether you expect to have quoted folders that contain semicolons in your `PATH` or not :-)...
Example usage:
```
PS C:\> Test-IsInPath -Path $env:PATH -Folder "c:\temp"
False

PS C:\> Test-IsInPath -Path "c:\temp;`"c:\my ; path`";c:\windows" -Folder "c:\temp"
True

PS C:\> Test-IsInPath -Path "c:\temp;`"c:\my ; path`";c:\windows" -Folder "c:\my ; path"
True
```

Note: what this  doesn't solve is paths that end (or don't end) with a trailing "\" - e.g. testing for `C:\temp` when the `PATH` contains `C:\temp\` and vice versa.

I would go for something like this
```
function FolderIsInPATH {
    param (
        [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]$your_searched_folder
        [parameter(Mandatory=$true)]
        [ValidateNotNullOrEmpty()]$Path
    )
    
    $Folders = Get-Childitem -Path $Path -Directory

    foreach ($Folder in $Folders) {
        if ($Folder.Name -eq $your_searched_folder) {
            ##Folder found
        } else {
            ##folder not found
        }
    }
}
```

You can get your PATH using [[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables()](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.getenvironmentvariables?view=net-6.0)
```
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables()
```

Or if you want to get the user environment variables:
```
[Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables("User")
```

Next, get the PATH variable:
```
$Path = [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables().Path # returns the PATH
```

Then check if the specified folder is in your PATH:
```
$Path.Contains($Path_to_directory + ";")
```

The function put together:
```
function FolderIsInPath($Path_to_directory) {
    return [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables("User").Path.Contains($Path_to_directory + ";")
}
```

However, this function is case-sensitive. You can use `String.ToLower()` to make it not case-sensitive.
```
function FolderIsInPath($Path_to_directory) {
    return [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables("User").Path.ToLower().Contains($Path_to_directory.ToLower() + ";")
}
```

Now call your function like this:
```
FolderIsInPath("C:\\path\\to\\directory")
```

Note that the path must be absolute.
As pointed out in [mclayton's comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73236809/how-can-i-tell-if-a-specified-folder-is-in-my-path-using-powershell#comment129344138_73237027), this function won't work for the last path variable. To address this issue, simply add a `;` to the end of the path. Your function would now look like this.
```
function FolderIsInPath($Path_to_directory) {
    return [Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariables("User").Path.ToLower() + ";".Contains($Path_to_directory.ToLower() + ";")
}
```
