I am trying to deploy an application to GCP on kubernetes, however, the deployment fails with the error `the job spec is invalid ... the field is immutable`.

In the migration job, I have a section of bash in the following format:

```
args:
        - |
          /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
          CHILD_PID=$!
          (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
          wait 
          if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```


but when the file is executed, in the yaml on GCP I see that the command has been enclosed in quotes and then it returns the above mention error.

It looks like the issue is with the way you are defining the `args` field in your Kubernetes deployment YAML file. The error message suggests that you are trying to modify an immutable field, which could be caused by the quotes around the command.

To fix this issue, you can try defining the `args` field as an array of strings instead of using a multi-line string with a pipe symbol. Here's an example:

```
args:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
    CHILD_PID=$!
    (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
    wait 
    if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```

This should define the `args` field as an array of strings, with each line of the command as a separate string element. This should prevent the quotes from being added around the command and allow the deployment to succeed.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like the issue is with the way you are defining the command in your YAML file. When you enclose the command in quotes, Kubernetes treats it as a single string and tries to set it as an immutable field. To fix this, you can define the command as an array of strings instead of a single string. Here's an example:

```
args:
  - /bin/bash
  - -c
  - |
    /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
    CHILD_PID=$!
    (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
    wait 
    if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```

In this example, we define the command as an array of strings, where the first element is the path to the shell (`/bin/bash`), the second element (`-c`) tells the shell to execute the command that follows, and the third element is the actual command that you want to execute. 

Try updating your YAML file with this format and see if it resolves the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like the issue is with the way the YAML file is being parsed. The quotes around the command may be causing the error.

To fix this, you can try escaping the quotes in the YAML file. For example, instead of enclosing the command in double quotes, you can use single quotes and escape any single quotes within the command with a backslash. Here's an example:

```
args:
        - '
          /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
          CHILD_PID=$!
          (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
          wait 
          if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
          '
```

This should prevent the YAML parser from enclosing the command in quotes and causing the error.
