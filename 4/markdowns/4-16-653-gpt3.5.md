I have data in a file where one column is a date column which has date in the following format:
```
2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-14T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-19T18:25:00.000+0100
```


```
10 MAY 2021
14 MAY 2021
19 MAY 2021
```


```
while -r read line
do
    year=`echo $line | awk '{ print $1 }' `
    month=`echo $line | awk '{ print $2 }' `
    dt=`echo $line | awk '{ print $3 }' `

    v=$dt"-"$month"-"$year
    d=date '`$v' | dd-mm-yyyy
    echo $d
done < /f/filename.txt
```

You can use the `date` command to convert the date format from `2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100` to `10 MAY 2021`. Here's an example script that reads the file line by line and converts the date format:

```
while read line
do
    date_str=`echo $line | awk '{print $1}'`
    year=`echo $date_str | cut -c1-4`
    month=`echo $date_str | cut -c6-7`
    day=`echo $date_str | cut -c9-10`
    new_date=`date -d "$year-$month-$day" +"%d %b %Y"`
    echo $new_date
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line of the file `filename.txt`, extracts the date string from the first column, and then uses `cut` to extract the year, month, and day components. It then uses the `date` command to convert the date string to the desired format (`%d %b %Y`), and prints the result to the console.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the `date` command to convert the date format in your file to the desired format. Here's an example script that you can use:

```
while read line
do
    date_str=`echo $line | awk '{ print $1 }'`
    new_date=`date -d "$date_str" +"%d %b %Y"`
    echo $new_date
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line of the file `filename.txt`, extracts the date string from the first column using `awk`, and then uses the `date` command to convert the date string to the desired format. The `%d`, `%b`, and `%Y` are format codes that represent the day, month abbreviation, and year respectively. The resulting date string is then printed to the console.

Note that the `date` command may not be available on all systems, so you may need to install it if it's not already installed.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To convert the date format from `2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100` to `10 MAY 2021`, you can use the following command:

```
date -d "2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100" +"%d %b %Y"
```

To apply this command to each line in the file, you can use a loop in a shell script like this:

```
while read line
do
    date_str=$(echo $line | awk '{print $1}')
    date=$(date -d "$date_str" +"%d %b %Y")
    echo $date
done < filename.txt
```

This will read each line from the file `filename.txt`, extract the date string, convert it to the desired format using the `date` command, and print the result.
