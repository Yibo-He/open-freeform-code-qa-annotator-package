I have a docker file as below. `launch.sh` is the entry point in this docker image. 

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        vim \
        net-tools \
        git \
        iputils-ping \
        wget

RUN apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ make libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install 7.9.0 && npm install -g npm@5.6.0

ADD ./Docker/launch.sh /workspace/

CMD ["/bin/sh", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


The content of `launch.sh` is:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```


when I run the docker container: `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, I got this error:

```
npm: not found
node: not found
```


The `node` in this image is managed by `nvm` which has been installed and its script has been set on `/root/.bashrc` file. But I don't know why it can't find the nodejs commands. But if I run the container by `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash`, then manually run `workspace/launch.sh` command, everything works fine. It seems the `~/.bashrc` is not executed when run the image. How can I let the container source .bashrc?

The content of `/root/.bashrc` is:

```
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that Docker does not run interactive shells, and therefore does not source `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile`. This is why you're able to run your script manually when you start the container with an interactive shell using `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash`, but not when Docker runs the script.

To solve this issue, you can source the `nvm.sh` script directly in your `launch.sh` script. This will ensure that `nvm` and therefore `node` and `npm` are available in the shell that your script runs in.

Here's how you can modify your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

export NVM_DIR="/root/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This script first sets the `NVM_DIR` environment variable and then sources the `nvm.sh` and `bash_completion` scripts if they exist. After that, it changes to your project directory, installs the npm dependencies, and runs your application.

The issue here is that the Docker `CMD` command does not run a login shell by default, so the `.bashrc` file is not sourced. 

You can modify your `launch.sh` script to source the `.bashrc` file before running the `npm install` and `node index.js` commands. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

source $HOME/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This will ensure that the `nvm` environment is properly set up before running the `npm` and `node` commands.

Alternatively, you can modify the `CMD` in your Dockerfile to run a bash login shell which will source the `.bashrc` file:

```Dockerfile
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```

The `-l` option tells bash to behave as a login shell, and the `-c` option tells it to execute the following command. This will ensure that the `.bashrc` file is sourced before running your `launch.sh` script.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're experiencing is due to the fact that Docker does not source the `~/.bashrc` file when it runs a command. The `~/.bashrc` file is sourced when you start a new interactive shell session, which is why it works when you run `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash` and then manually run the `launch.sh` script.

To solve this issue, you can source the `~/.bashrc` file directly in your `launch.sh` script. Here is how you can modify your `launch.sh` script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Source the .bashrc file
source ~/.bashrc

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```

This way, the `~/.bashrc` file will be sourced every time the `launch.sh` script is run, ensuring that `nvm` is properly loaded and the `node` and `npm` commands are available.

However, please note that sourcing `~/.bashrc` might not be a good practice in a Dockerfile, as it can lead to unexpected behavior. A better approach would be to install Node.js directly in the Dockerfile without using `nvm`. This way, the `node` and `npm` commands will be available system-wide, and you won't need to source any files in your `launch.sh` script.
