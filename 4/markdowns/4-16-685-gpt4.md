I mistakenly deleted the entire PATH variable under System Variables. So I tried to add a variable named PATH explicitly, to the System Variable. But now whenever I try to add multiple PATHs, each PATH overwrites the previous one.

As you can see, instead of opening the list of paths, it just gives the option of one path. So I tried to append a PATH variable using command line.

`setx path "D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m`

[Screenshot 2](https://i.stack.imgur.com/yGnnk.jpg)

It still overwrites the previous path. As shown, the Java path(from [Screenshot 1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/4V1aj.jpg)) got overwritten by the MongoDB path.

How do I resolve this issue ? How do I add multiple paths to the PATH variable ?

P.S - I use Windows 10 (64 bit).

You can add multiple paths to the PATH variable by separating them with a semicolon (;). 

However, the `setx` command you're using overwrites the existing PATH. If you want to append a new path to the existing ones, you should include the existing PATH in your command. 

Here's how you can do it:

```cmd
setx /M PATH "%PATH%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin"
```

This command gets the current PATH (`%PATH%`), appends the new path (`;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin`), and sets the result as the new PATH.

Please note that `setx` command has a character limit of 1024 characters. If your PATH is longer than this, you may encounter issues. In such cases, you should edit the PATH variable directly from the System Properties window.

To add a new path from System Properties:

1. Open System Properties (Right-click on This PC -> Properties -> Advanced system settings).
2. Click on Environment Variables.
3. Under System variables, find and select the PATH variable, then click on Edit.
4. In the Edit Environment Variable window, click on New, then enter the new path.
5. Click OK to close all windows.

Remember, each path should be on a new line or separated by a semicolon (;) if you're entering them in a single line.

The PATH variable is a system variable that allows your operating system to locate needed executables from the command line or Terminal window. If you accidentally deleted it, you can restore it by adding multiple paths separated by semicolons (;).

Here are the steps to add multiple paths to the PATH variable:

1. Open the System Properties (Right click Computer in the start menu, or use the keyboard shortcut Win+Pause)
2. Click Advanced system settings in the sidebar.
3. Click Environment Variables in the bottom of the window.
4. Then under system variables look for the path variable and click edit.
5. Add your path using semicolon (;) as a separator for multiple paths.

For example, if you want to add `D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin` and `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\bin`, your PATH variable should look like this:

`D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin;C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_121\bin`

If you want to add a new path via the command line, you need to get the current PATH variable value, append your new path to it, and then set the new value. Here's how you can do it:

```cmd
for /f "skip=2 tokens=3" %A in ('reg query HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager\Environment /v Path') do @echo %A
```

This will output the current system PATH. Copy this value, append your new path to it (with a semicolon before it), and then use `setx` to set the new value:

```cmd
setx /M PATH "old_path_value;your_new_path"
```

Replace `old_path_value` with the value you copied and `your_new_path` with the path you want to add.

Please note that `setx` has a character limit of 1024 characters. If your PATH is longer than this, you will need to use the System Properties dialog, or it will get truncated.

The `setx` command overwrites the existing value of the PATH variable. If you want to append a new path to the existing PATH variable, you should include `%PATH%` in your command. Here's how you can do it:

```cmd
setx PATH "%PATH%;D:\Softwares\MongoDB\bin" /m
```

This command will append the new path to the existing PATH variable instead of overwriting it.

However, there's a limitation with `setx` command. It can only handle values up to 1024 characters long. If your PATH variable is longer than that, it will be truncated and you might lose some paths.

A safer way to modify your PATH variable is to do it through the System Properties window:

1. Right-click on Computer on the desktop or in Start Menu.
2. Choose "Properties".
3. Click on "Advanced system settings".
4. In the System Properties window that appears, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
5. In the Environment Variables window, under "System variables", scroll down until you find the "Path" variable, then click on it to highlight it.
6. Click on the "Edit" button.
7. In the Edit Environment Variable window that appears, you can add new paths by typing them into the "Variable value" box, each one separated by a semicolon (;). Be careful not to make any other changes.
8. Click "OK" in each window to close them.

Remember to restart your command prompt or any other applications that use the PATH variable to make sure they pick up the new value.
