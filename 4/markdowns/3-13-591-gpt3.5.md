In my application I want used  function and I want return !
I set return value from function and I write below codes, but show me  value!

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>): String {
    var itemSelected = ""
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
    Log.e("categoryLog","2 : " +itemSelected)
    return itemSelected
}
```

When show logs in , first show 2 then show 1 !

```
2022-08-12 14:49:59.261 12074-12074/com.my.app E/categoryLog: 2 : 
2022-08-12 14:49:59.310 12074-12074/com.my.app E/categoryLog: 1 : Movies
```

Why first call  then call  ?!
I used this  in fragment and for this when used this in `fragment` show me  value!
How can I fix it?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelectedListener` is triggered only when an item is selected in the spinner. Until then, the `itemSelected` variable remains empty. When an item is selected, the `onItemSelected` method is called and the `itemSelected` variable is assigned the selected item from the list. That's why you see the log with `itemSelected` value after the log without any value.

If you want to return the selected item from the function, you can't do it synchronously because the selection happens asynchronously. One way to achieve this is by using a callback function. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this modified function, instead of returning the selected item, we pass a callback function as a parameter. The callback function takes a `String` parameter, which is the selected item from the spinner. When an item is selected, we call the callback function with the selected item as the argument.

To use this function, you can pass a lambda function as the callback parameter. Here's an example:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
    Log.e("categoryLog", "Selected item: $selectedItem")
}
```

In this example, we pass a lambda function that takes the selected item as a parameter and logs it. You can replace the log statement with any other code that you want to execute with the selected item.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The reason why the log with value `2` is printed before the log with value `1` is because the `onItemSelectedListener` is triggered only when an item is selected from the spinner. Until an item is selected, the value of `itemSelected` remains empty. Therefore, when you call the function, the log with value `2` is printed first because it is outside the `onItemSelectedListener`.

To fix this, you can use a callback function to return the selected item from the spinner. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, callback: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            callback(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this updated function, instead of returning the selected item, we pass a callback function as a parameter. The callback function takes the selected item as a parameter and returns nothing. When an item is selected from the spinner, we call the callback function with the selected item as the argument.

To use this function, you can pass a lambda function as the callback parameter. Here's an example:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(listOf("Item 1", "Item 2", "Item 3")) { selectedItem ->
    Log.d("Selected Item", selectedItem)
}
```

In this example, we pass a list of items to the `setupListWithAdapter` function and a lambda function as the callback parameter. The lambda function takes the selected item as a parameter and logs it to the console. When an item is selected from the spinner, the lambda function is called with the selected item as the argument.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The reason why you are seeing the logs in that order is because the `onItemSelectedListener` is triggered only when an item is selected from the spinner. Until then, the `itemSelected` variable remains empty. When you call the function, the `itemSelected` variable is empty and that's why you see the log "2 : " first.

To fix this, you can change the return type of the function to `Unit` and use a callback to pass the selected item back to the calling code. Here's an example:

```
fun Spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list: MutableList<String>, onItemSelected: (String) -> Unit) {
    val adapter = ArrayAdapter(context, android.R.layout.simple_spinner_item, list)
    adapter.setDropDownViewResource(android.R.layout.simple_spinner_dropdown_item)
    this.adapter = adapter
    this.onItemSelectedListener = object : AdapterView.OnItemSelectedListener {
        override fun onItemSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?, p1: View?, p2: Int, p3: Long) {
            val itemSelected = list[p2]
            Log.e("categoryLog","1 : " + itemSelected)
            onItemSelected(itemSelected)
        }
        override fun onNothingSelected(p0: AdapterView<*>?) {
        }
    }
}
```

In this version of the function, we pass in a callback function `onItemSelected` which takes a `String` parameter. When an item is selected from the spinner, we call this callback function with the selected item as the argument.

To use this function, you can call it like this:

```
spinner.setupListWithAdapter(list) { selectedItem ->
    // Do something with the selected item
    Log.e("categoryLog","Selected item: $selectedItem")
}
```

In this example, we pass in a lambda function as the `onItemSelected` callback. This lambda function takes a `String` parameter which represents the selected item. You can do whatever you want with this selected item inside the lambda function.
