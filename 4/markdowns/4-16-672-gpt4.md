I would like to print a file in cat << EOF>. e.g.
```
$cat file
ad3
c43
34e
se3
we3
```

My script is:
```
$cat run.sh
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
cat file #I would like to print the content of the file here
some commands
EOF
```

I can't able to print as desire with `./run.sh`
Desire output
```
$cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
ad3
c43
34e
se3
we3
some commands
```

You can achieve this by using command substitution in your bash script. Command substitution allows the output of a command to replace the command itself. It occurs when a command is enclosed as follows: `$(command)`. 

Here is how you can modify your `run.sh` script:

```bash
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

In this script, `$(cat file)` will be replaced by the content of the file. When you run `./run.sh`, it will generate `test.sh` with the desired output.

You can achieve this by using command substitution in bash. Here's how you can modify your script:

```bash
$cat run.sh
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

In this script, `$(cat file)` will be replaced by the content of the file. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create `test.sh` with the desired output.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

You can use command substitution `$(command)` to print the content of the file within the heredoc. Here is how you can modify your script:

```bash
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will replace `$(cat file)` with the content of the file when the script is run.
