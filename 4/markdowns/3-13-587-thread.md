Today I updated gradle and kotlin dependencies in android studio.
The new versions are these:
```
kotlin_version = "1.5.10"
...
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.6"
}
...
distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.0.2-all.zip
```

The test coverage report task fails with the following error:
```

For Kotlin `1.5` you should use JaCoCo `0.8.7` instead of `0.8.6` - see [https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/pull/1164](https://github.com/jacoco/jacoco/pull/1164) and the full changelog at [https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/changes.html](https://www.jacoco.org/jacoco/trunk/doc/changes.html)
Example snippet:
```
// build.gradle or build.gradle.kts
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

I already had the
```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

configured but it was not working anyway, what fixed the problem was to follow this comment [here](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/178400721#comment18)

1. In your module build.gradle switch back to:


```
android {
    //....
    compileOptions {
        sourceCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
        targetCompatibility JavaVersion.VERSION_1_8
    }

    kotlinOptions {
        jvmTarget = "1.8"
    }
}
```

don't worry, it won't break anything if you were not using Java 11 language features yet, AGP 7 is still compatible with JDK 8 as target.

1. Then you need to force AGP to use the 0.8.7 version and not the default 0.8.3 one. In your allprojects block in the root build.gradle file, add this:


```
allprojects {
  //... other things

  // workaround to fix an auto-import of a lower Jacoco version
  resolutionStrategy {
    eachDependency { details ->
      if ('org.jacoco' == details.requested.group) {
        details.useVersion "0.8.7"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

and now it should work using:
```
AGP 7.0.X
Kotlin 1.5.X
JDK 11 (embedded with AS)
```

Simply doing
```
jacoco {
    toolVersion = "0.8.7"
}
```

was not enough for me. I also had to override the version that Android was using so that the `androidJacocoAnt` dependency also uses 0.8.7. (`./gradlew app:dependencies`) Simply add this to your gradle too
```
android.jacoco.version = "0.8.7"
```

It's quite old thread, but these solutions did not solve my problems completely in Android project (actually written in Java - not in Kotlin), so I will add my solutions here. Maybe someone will find it helpful.
Except of updating jacoco toolVersion to `0.8.7`, I also had to update execution data in my jacoco config as follows:
```
project.afterEvaluate {
  tasks.create(name: "${unitTestTask}Coverage", type: JacocoReport, 
  dependsOn: [
    "$unitTestTask",
    ":sdk:testDebugUnitTest",
    ":sdk:connectedCheck"
  ]) {

   /* all jacoco custom configuration goes here... */

    executionData(fileTree(dir: "$buildDir", includes: [
      "jacoco/testDebugUnitTest.exec",        
      "outputs/unit_test_code_coverage/debugUnitTest/testDebugUnitTest.exec",
      "outputs/code_coverage/debugAndroidTest/connected/*coverage.ec"
    ]))
  }
}
```

in this configuration I had to add the following line:
```
"outputs/unit_test_code_coverage/debugUnitTest/testDebugUnitTest.exec"
```

which wasn't there before because file with generated report used by sonar was generated in the new location. Report is generated with gradle task `testDebugUnitTestCoverage`. After all of that, I'm able to generate test coverage report including connected/instrumentation Android tests and regular unit tests in java via sonar.
