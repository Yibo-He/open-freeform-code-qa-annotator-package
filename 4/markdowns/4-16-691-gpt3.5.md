Apparently, none of the Flutter commands are working in the terminal of Android Studio which I believe I am trying to run it at the root of my project.
Output:
```
bash: flutter: command not found
```

It seems like the Flutter SDK is not properly installed or added to the system path. Here are the steps to fix this issue:

1. First, make sure that you have installed the Flutter SDK on your system. You can download it from the official Flutter website.

2. Once you have downloaded the Flutter SDK, extract the contents of the archive to a suitable location on your system.

3. Next, add the Flutter SDK to your system path. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:

   ```
   export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]/bin"
   ```

   Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK]` with the actual path to the Flutter SDK on your system.

4. Finally, verify that the Flutter SDK is properly installed and added to the system path by running the following command in the terminal:

   ```
   flutter doctor
   ```

   This command will check your system for any missing dependencies and provide guidance on how to install them.

If you still face any issues, please let me know.

It seems like the Flutter SDK is not properly installed or added to the system path. Here are the steps you can follow to fix this issue:

1. Check if Flutter is installed: Open a terminal window and run the following command:

   ```
   flutter --version
   ```

   If Flutter is not installed, you can follow the installation guide from the official Flutter website.

2. Add Flutter to the system path: If Flutter is installed but not added to the system path, you can add it manually. Here are the steps to add Flutter to the system path:

   - Open the terminal and run the following command to open the bash profile:

     ```
     nano ~/.bash_profile
     ```

   - Add the following lines at the end of the file:

     ```
     export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
     export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin/cache/dart-sdk/bin"
     ```

     Replace `[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_GIT_DIRECTORY]` with the actual path to the Flutter SDK directory.

   - Save the file and exit the editor.

3. Refresh the terminal: Close and reopen the terminal window or run the following command to refresh the terminal:

   ```
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

4. Verify Flutter installation: Run the following command to verify if Flutter is added to the system path:

   ```
   echo $PATH
   ```

   You should see the path to the Flutter SDK directory in the output.

After following these steps, you should be able to run Flutter commands in the terminal of Android Studio.

It seems like Flutter is not installed or not added to the system path. Here are the steps to install Flutter and add it to the system path:

1. Download the Flutter SDK from the official website: https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install
2. Extract the downloaded file to a desired location.
3. Add the Flutter SDK path to the system path. To do this, open the terminal and run the following command:
```
export PATH="$PATH:[PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK_DIRECTORY]/flutter/bin"
```
Replace [PATH_TO_FLUTTER_SDK_DIRECTORY] with the actual path to the Flutter SDK directory.
4. Verify the installation by running the following command:
```
flutter doctor
```
This command will check if all the necessary dependencies are installed and provide guidance on how to install any missing components.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be able to run Flutter commands in the terminal of Android Studio.
