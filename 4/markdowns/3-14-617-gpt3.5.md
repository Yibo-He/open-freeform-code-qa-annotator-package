Command `PhaseScriptExecution` failed with a `nonzero` exit code

I deleted derived data.
i have tried :  

> keychain access -> right click on login -> lock & unlock again ->
  clear Xcode project

Restarted machine, no use

How do I resolve "`Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code`" error when trying to archive project. 

And I am using those librarys 

```
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift'
pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 4.0'
pod 'KRPullLoader'
pod 'Paytm-Payments'
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The error message indicates that there was a problem with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command during the archive process. This could be caused by a variety of issues, such as missing dependencies or build settings.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check your build settings: Make sure that your build settings are correct and that all required dependencies are included. Check that the correct version of Xcode is being used and that the deployment target is set correctly.

2. Clean your project: Clean your project by going to Product > Clean Build Folder. This will remove any cached build files and force Xcode to rebuild everything from scratch.

3. Check your code: Check your code for any errors or warnings. Fix any issues that are found and try building again.

4. Update your pods: Update your pods to the latest version by running `pod update` in the terminal. This will ensure that you have the latest bug fixes and improvements.

5. Remove and re-add problematic pods: Try removing the problematic pods (`IQKeyboardManagerSwift`, `SDWebImage`, `KRPullLoader`, `Paytm-Payments`) from your project and then re-adding them. This can sometimes resolve issues with dependencies.

6. Try a different build configuration: Try building with a different build configuration (e.g. Debug instead of Release) to see if the issue persists.

If none of these steps resolve the issue, you may need to seek further assistance from a more experienced developer or the library's support team.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The error message indicates that there was a problem with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command during the archive process. This could be caused by a number of issues, such as missing dependencies or build settings.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check your build settings: Make sure that your build settings are correct and that all required dependencies are included. You can check this by going to your project settings and looking at the Build Phases tab.

2. Clean your project: Try cleaning your project by going to Product > Clean in Xcode. This will remove any temporary files and build artifacts that may be causing the issue.

3. Update your pods: Make sure that your pods are up to date by running `pod update` in your project directory. This will update all of your pods to their latest versions.

4. Check for conflicts: Make sure that there are no conflicts between your pods and other dependencies in your project. You can check this by running `pod outdated` in your project directory.

5. Try a different version of Xcode: If none of the above steps work, try using a different version of Xcode. Sometimes, certain versions of Xcode can have issues with specific libraries or dependencies.

If none of these steps work, you may need to consult the documentation for the specific library or dependency that is causing the issue, or seek help from the library's support team.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `PhaseScriptExecution` command. This command is typically used to run scripts during the build process. 

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. Check the build log for any additional error messages or warnings that may provide more information about the issue.

2. Try cleaning the project by selecting Product > Clean Build Folder from the Xcode menu. This will delete the build folder and any intermediate files that may be causing the issue.

3. Check if any of the libraries you are using have been updated recently. If so, try updating your project to use the latest version of the library.

4. Try removing the libraries one by one and see if the issue persists. This will help you identify if one of the libraries is causing the issue.

5. Try disabling any custom build scripts or phases that you may have added to the project.

6. If none of the above steps work, try creating a new Xcode project and adding your code and libraries to it. This will help you identify if the issue is specific to your project or if it is a more general issue with Xcode or the libraries you are using.
