The app crashes as soon as it gets installed and throws the weird error above.
I have annotated the activity as shown below as well as its child fragments.
```
@AndroidEntryPoint
    class HomeActivity : AppCompatActivity() {
        companion object{
           lateinit var currentUser: User
        }
        override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
            super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
    
            setContentView(R.layout.activity_home)
            val navController = Navigation.findNavController(this, R.id.home_nav)
            val bottomNavigationView: BottomNavigationView = findViewById(R.id.bottom_navigation)
            bottomNavigationView.setupWithNavController(navController)
            fetchCurrentUser()
        }
```

Also attaching the Application class which is mandatory for every app using Hilt as per the documentation
```
@HiltAndroidApp
class CoreApplication:Application()
```

and the logcat of the crash
```

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

The error message suggests that your application is not being recognized as a Hilt application. This is because your application is being treated as a `MultiDexApplication` instead of your `CoreApplication` which is annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`.

This could be due to a few reasons:

1. You might have forgotten to specify your application class in the AndroidManifest.xml file. Make sure you have the following line in your AndroidManifest.xml:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...>
</application>
```

2. If you are using a library that automatically initializes itself (like Firebase), it might be initializing itself before Hilt. In this case, you need to disable the automatic initialization and initialize it manually after Hilt.

3. If you are using custom Application class, make sure it extends `Application` and is annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`.

4. If you are using multidex, make sure you have enabled it correctly. In your build.gradle file, you should have:

```groovy
android {
    defaultConfig {
        ...
        multiDexEnabled true
    }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.android.support:multidex:1.0.3'
}
```

And in your Application class:

```kotlin
@HiltAndroidApp
class CoreApplication : MultiDexApplication() {
    ...
}
```

5. If none of the above solutions work, try cleaning and rebuilding your project. Sometimes, the build cache can cause issues.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message you're seeing is indicating that your `HomeActivity` is trying to use Hilt for dependency injection, but it can't find an `@AndroidEntryPoint` Application class. 

You've correctly annotated your `CoreApplication` class with `@HiltAndroidApp`, but it seems like your application is not using `CoreApplication` as the application class, but instead using `androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication`.

You need to specify your `CoreApplication` class as the application class in your AndroidManifest.xml file. Here's how you can do it:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...>
    ...
</application>
```

Make sure to replace `...` with the rest of your application attributes and inner elements. 

After this change, your `HomeActivity` should be able to find the `@AndroidEntryPoint` Application class and Hilt should work as expected.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is telling you that your `HomeActivity` is trying to use Hilt, but it can't find an `@AndroidEntryPoint` Application class. 

You have annotated your `CoreApplication` with `@HiltAndroidApp`, which is correct. However, it seems like your application is not using `CoreApplication` as the Application class, but instead it's using `androidx.multidex.MultiDexApplication`.

To fix this, you need to specify `CoreApplication` as the application class in your `AndroidManifest.xml` file. Here's how you can do it:

```xml
<application
    android:name=".CoreApplication"
    ...>
    ...
</application>
```

This tells Android to use `CoreApplication` as the application class, which is annotated with `@HiltAndroidApp`, so Hilt should work correctly. 

After making this change, clean and rebuild your project. If the problem persists, please provide more information about your setup.
