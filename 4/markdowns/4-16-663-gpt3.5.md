From [this Answer (here)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72246808/10343144), I believe there may not be a way to do this using globbing.

# tl;dr


I need:
- - `ls``sed``cp``cat``chown``rm`- - - 
I'm using `grep` & `ls` only as examples, but I need a glob expression that applies to other commands also.
- `grep -r --include=GLOB``cp``grep`- `find``grep``|``while do;`

## Examples


Suppose I have these files, all containing "find me":
```
./file1.js
./file2.php
./inc/file3.js
./inc/file4.php
./inc.php/file5.js
./inc.php/file6.php
```

I need to match only/all  one time:
```
./file2.php
./inc/file4.php
./inc.php/file6.php
```


## Duplicates returned: shopt -s globstar; ... **/*.php


This changes the problem; it does not solve it.

### Dup: ls


 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`ls **/*.php` returns:
```
inc/file4.php
inc.php/file5.js
inc.php/file6.php
```

- 
 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`ls **/*.php` returns:
```
file2.php
inc/file4.php
inc.php/file6.php

inc.php:
file5.js
file6.php
```

- 

### Dup: grep


 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`grep -R "find me" **/*.php` returns:
```
inc/file4.php: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
```

- 
 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`grep -R "find me" **/*.php` returns:
```
file2.php: find me
inc/file4.php: find me
inc.php/file5.js: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
```

- - `ls`

## Current solution: faulty misuse of && logic


```
grep -r "find me" *.php && grep -r "find me" */*.php
ls -l *.php && ls -l */*.php
```

- `I fail here && so I never happen`

## Desired solution: single command via globbing


```
grep -r "find me" [GLOB]
ls -l [GLOB]
```

## Insight from grep


`grep` does have the `--include` flag, which achieves the same result but using a flag specific to `grep`. `ls` does not have an `--include` option. This leads me to believe that there is no such glob expression, which is why `grep` has this flag.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like you are looking for a way to use globbing to apply commands to specific files with certain extensions or patterns. While globbing can be useful for selecting files based on patterns, it may not always be the best solution for applying commands to specific files.

For example, if you want to apply a command to all files with a certain extension, you can use the `find` command with the `-name` option:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec grep "find me" {} \;
```

This will find all files with the `.php` extension in the current directory and its subdirectories, and then execute the `grep` command on each file.

Similarly, if you want to copy all files with a certain extension to a new directory, you can use the `find` command with the `-exec` option:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec cp {} /path/to/new/directory \;
```

This will find all files with the `.php` extension in the current directory and its subdirectories, and then copy each file to the specified directory.

In general, it's a good idea to use the appropriate command for the task at hand, rather than trying to shoehorn globbing into a solution.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like you are looking for a way to use globbing to match specific files or directories for various commands. While globbing can be a powerful tool for pattern matching, it may not always be the best solution for more complex tasks.

For example, if you want to copy all PHP files in a directory and its subdirectories to a new location, you can use the `find` command with the `-name` option to match only PHP files, and then pipe the output to `xargs` to copy the files:

```
find . -name "*.php" | xargs -I {} cp {} /path/to/new/location/
```

Similarly, if you want to search for a specific string in all PHP files in a directory and its subdirectories, you can use `find` with `grep`:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec grep "find me" {} \;
```

These commands may be more verbose than using globbing, but they offer more control and flexibility for complex tasks.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like you are looking for a way to use globbing to match specific files or file types for various commands such as `ls`, `cp`, `cat`, `chown`, and `rm`. While globbing can be a powerful tool for matching files based on patterns, it may not always be the best solution for every use case.

In your specific example, you are looking to match only PHP files that contain a certain string. One way to achieve this is to use the `find` command with the `-name` and `-exec` options:

```
find . -name "*.php" -exec grep "find me" {} \;
```

This will search for all PHP files in the current directory and its subdirectories, and then execute the `grep` command on each file that contains the string "find me".

For other commands such as `ls`, you can use globbing to match specific file types or patterns:

```
ls *.php      # matches all PHP files in the current directory
ls dir/*.txt  # matches all TXT files in the "dir" directory
```

You can also use globbing with other commands such as `cp`, `cat`, `chown`, and `rm`:

```
cp *.txt backup/      # copies all TXT files in the current directory to the "backup" directory
cat *.log             # concatenates all log files in the current directory
chown user:group *.sh # changes ownership of all shell scripts in the current directory
rm *.bak              # removes all backup files in the current directory
```

However, keep in mind that globbing can sometimes match unintended files or patterns, so it's important to double-check the results before executing any commands.
