I am trying to store the value of sql query output in a variable using shell script.
```
size=`${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
select owner, sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX' group by owner;
exit;
EOF`
echo "Total data is ${size}"
```

The output I am getting is
```
**Total data is**

Inside the variable full connection string and sql query output all are getting stored. I just want to get value like  Please tell me how to get that

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can modify your script to extract only the required value from the SQL query output using the `grep` and `awk` commands. Here's an example:

```
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -S $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF
set feedback off
set heading off
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF
)
size=$(echo $size | grep -o '[0-9]*\.[0-9]*')
echo "Total data is ${size} GB"
```

In this modified script, we have added the following changes:

- We have added the `-S` option to `sqlplus` command to suppress unnecessary output.
- We have added `set feedback off` and `set heading off` commands to suppress SQL*Plus output.
- We have modified the SQL query to directly select the required value without the owner column.
- We have used `grep` command to extract the floating-point number from the SQL query output.
- We have assigned the extracted value to the `size` variable and used it in the output message.

This should give you the desired output with only the value of the SQL query output stored in the `size` variable.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can modify your shell script to extract the required value from the SQL query output using text processing tools like `awk`. Here's an example:

```
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT<< EOF | awk '/XXXX/{print $2}'
set heading off;
select owner, sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX' group by owner;
exit;
EOF
)
echo "Total data is ${size} GB"
```

In this modified script, we are piping the SQL query output to `awk` command which searches for the string 'XXXX' and prints the second field (Size_GB) from that line. This extracted value is then stored in the `size` variable which can be used later.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can modify your shell script to extract the required value from the output of the SQL query. Here's an example:

```
size=$(${PATH_TO_CLIENT}sqlplus -S $IMPUSER/$IMPPWD@$ENDPOINT << EOF
set pagesize 0 feedback off verify off heading off echo off;
select sum(bytes)/1024/1024/1024 Size_GB from dba_segments where owner = 'XXXX';
exit;
EOF
)
echo "Total data is ${size} GB"
```

In this modified script, we have added the following SQL*Plus commands to suppress unnecessary output:

- `set pagesize 0` - to remove the page header and footer
- `feedback off` - to suppress the "X rows selected" message
- `verify off` - to disable verification of substitution variables
- `heading off` - to remove the column headings
- `echo off` - to suppress the SQL query itself

We have also removed the `group by` clause from the SQL query, as we are only interested in the total size. Finally, we have used the `-S` option with `sqlplus` to suppress SQL*Plus commands and output.

The output of the SQL query will now be stored in the `size` variable as a single value (e.g. "12.2345"), which you can use as required.
