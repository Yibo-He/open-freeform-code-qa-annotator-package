Is it possible to create Kotlin like scope functions in Javascript/Typescript? Is there any library that does it?

No, you can't do that in JavaScript or TypeScript. But depending on  you're trying to do it, destructuring can help.
The closest you can get is to use the deprecated `with` statement, which adds an object to the top of the scope chain, so any freestanding identifier references are checked against the object's properties:
```
function example(o) {
    with (o) { // deprecated
        console.log(answer);
    }
}
const obj = {
    answer: 42
};
example(obj); // Outputs 42
```


There are several problems with `with`, though, which is why it's disallowed in the strict variant of JavaScript (which is the default inside modules, `class` constructs, and other new scopes created in ES2015+, as well as any function or script with `"use strict";` at the beginning).
Another close version is to pass an object to a function that uses destructuring in its parameter list:
```
function example({answer}) {
    console.log(answer);
}
const obj = {
    answer: 42
};
example(obj); // Outputs 42
```


 a major caveat there is that you can't assign new values to properties that way (and worse, if you try — for instance, with `answer = 67` — it updates the parameter's value but not the object's property value).
To deal with that, you might use destructuring inside the function instead, with `const` so you don't forget you can't update the value (or to get an early error if you try):
```
function example(o) {
    const {answer} = o;
    console.log(answer);
    // answer = 67;   // <== Would cause error
    // o.answer = 67; // <== Would work
}
const obj = {
    answer: 42
};
example(obj); // Outputs 42
```

If anyone is still looking for an answer, there is an excellent library for those scope functions for javascript (I am not affiliated):

[https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazymacro](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lazymacro)
This package provides the feature you need and its implementation is pretty simple (through `Object.defineProperty` see [code](https://github.com/lazynode/lazymacro/blob/06eec1c0141e9a161bf47d624124fbd5d9c0329f/index.js)).
- `obj.PIPE(f)``let`- `obj.PIPETHIS(f)``run`- `obj.WITH(f)``also`- `obj.WITHTHIS(f)``apply`
Then you can write something like:
```
["I", "am"]
    .WITH(v => v.push("lazynode."))
    .WITH(console.log)
    .PIPE(v => v.join(" "))
    .PIPE(v => console.log(`${v}`))
    ?.PIPE(v => console.log("null safety features can be used together!"));
```


It provides scope functions for `Promise`, which can save you from the `await`/`then` hell
- `promise.THEN(f)`- `promise.WAIT(f)`
example:
```
Promise.resolve({})
    .WAIT(async local => local.datax = await getSomeRemoteData())
    .WAIT(async local => local.datay = await getSomeRemoteData())
    .WAIT(async local => local.dataz = await getSomeRemoteData())
    .WAIT(async local => await doSomething(local.datax, local.datay, local.dataz));
```

While not exactly what you're looking for, a pattern that I use `let` a lot for in Kotlin is
```
val thing = nullable?.let{ // case if not null } ?: run { // case if null }
```

The closest I've come to this in Javascript (well, typescript) in terms of readability and ergonomics is something like:
```
const thing = some?.deeply?.nested?.nullable?.thing ?? (() => {
// case if null
})
```

Which gets you halfway there. :)
