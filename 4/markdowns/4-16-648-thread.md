If you have a Mac and updated to Catalina or more recent version, then the root folder is no
longer writable.
I just changed the directory somewhere else.
Been using this command for now
```
mongod --dbpath=/Users/user/data/db
```

from the official docs [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

install [homebrew](https://brew.sh) and run the following commands

`sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*`

then

`brew tap mongodb/brew`

then 

`brew install mongodb-community@4.2`

and 

`brew services start mongodb-community`

or

`mongod --config /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`

then

`ps aux | grep -v grep | grep mongod`

and

`mongo`

to verify you can run `show dbs` in the mongo shell

With the new macOS Catalina update, the folder `/data/db` becomes read-only, you cannot modify it. Follow this procedure to create a DB in another folder:

1. Change mongod directory : sudo mongod --dbpath /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
2. Give it an alias to use it as mongod: alias mongod="sudo mongod --dbpath /System/Volumes/Data/data/db"
3. Just type mongod in your terminal, it should work.


 => If you need to give it current user rights, use this line of code :
`sudo chown -R $(whoami) /System/Volumes/Data/data/db`
(Just for info -> `$(whoami)` is just a variable that returns your current user)

## You can't create a folder on the root directory on Mac Catalina anymore!


[https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/features/](https://www.apple.com/macos/catalina/features/)

## Dedicated system volume


> macOS Catalina runs in a dedicated, read-only system volume — which means it is completely separate from all other data and helps improve the reliability of macOS.
```
# macOS Catalina, mkdir path
$ sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db

# give permissions
$ sudo chown -R `id -un` /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
```

```
# macOS 10.14.x -
$ sudo mkdir -p /data/db

# macOS 10.15.x +
$ sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
```

To make a permanent change of the path of mongod `db` folder.

Following [these docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#run-mongodb-community-edition) they say roughly this. If mongod is started with brew services:

```
$ brew services start mongodb-community@4.2
```


It will use config file at path `/usr/local/etc/mongod.conf`


---



To fix this, edit the config file:

```
$ vim /usr/local/etc/mongod.conf
```


And change the `dbPath` e.g. to your home directory like this:

```
systemLog:
  destination: file
  path: /usr/local/var/log/mongodb/mongo.log
  logAppend: true
storage:
  dbPath: /Users/<username>/data/db
net:
  bindIp: 127.0.0.1
```


Save the file and restart mongod with brew:

```
$ brew services restart mongodb-community@4.2
```

So, with macOS Catalina Apple created a new Volume for security purposes. If you’re on macOS Catalina, you'll need to create the `/data/db` folder in `System/Volumes/Data`.
Follow these commands

1. sudo mkdir -p /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
2. sudo chown -R id -un /System/Volumes/Data/data/db


Start MongoDB

1. brew services run mongodb-community
2. Enjoy

If you are on mac and facing the issue then below command is useful, 
`whoami` variable will get the current user  

```
mongod --dbpath=/Users/$(whoami)/data/db
```

I am at a loss why Apple did that.. So now, we can not have any root level directory other than theirs ? This just doesn't make any sense and people creating with root privileges those folders know what they are doing

Default Paths for the mongodb-community Formula
In addition to installing the MongoDB server and tool binaries, the mongodb-community formula creates:
- - - 
then it worked for me:
```
mkdir -p usr/local/var/mongodb/data/db
```

This is what worked for me as I was undergoing a Udemy course:
1. Install HomeBrew by typing this into your terminal

```
/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
```



1. Move your old /data/db folder (if you want to backup your current dbs) into a non root folder and proceed with the next step
2. Run in Terminal a) brew uninstall mongodb b) If needed run brew uninstall --force mongodb c) brew tap mongodb/brew d) brew install mongodb-community e) brew services start mongodb/brew/mongodb-community
3. All you need now is to run mongo in the Terminal and you'll see the mongo shell symbol >.



Please let me know if this works ;) 
It took me almost 2 hours to figure it out, based on this article:
[https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/362883/mongodb-doesnt-work-after-update-to-macos-catalina-10-15](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/362883/mongodb-doesnt-work-after-update-to-macos-catalina-10-15)

I did this:

```
mkdir -p usr/local/var/mongodb/data/db
```


since the new path that is "usr/local/var/mongodb".

To add on to what [David Buck wrote here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/61423909), first you have to actually make the directory.  You can do that with:
> sudo mkdir /System/Volumes/Data/data/db
If you're getting this error:
> "Error parsing command line: unrecognised option
'--dbpath/System/Volumes/Data/data/db' try 'mongod --help' for more
information"
after creating the alias, it's just because David Buck (while making a really helpful comment) missed a space in his answer.
To fix this, type
> unalias mongod
and then type
> alias mongod="sudo mongod --dbpath /System/Volumes/Data/data/db"

You cannot create a `/data/` directory. That is reserved for the APFS filesystem. Check [Bombich’s](https://bombich.com/kb/ccc5/working-apfs-volume-groups) blog about this issue.

With macOS Catalina, you can no longer store files or data in the read-only system volume, nor can you write to the "root" directory ( / ) from the command line, such as with Terminal.

I create a gist with simple steps to install and run mongodb on catalina

```
# install homebrew (https://brew.sh/) and run the following commands
sudo chown -R $(whoami) $(brew --prefix)/*
brew tap mongodb/brew
brew install mongodb-community@4.2

## --- aliases to set in your zshrc file

# open your zshrc file
open ~/.zshrc
# copy and paste shorcuts in the end of the file
alias mongod='brew services run mongodb-community'
alias mongod-start='brew services start mongodb-community' #will start MongoDB automatically when you login into your Macbook
alias mongod-status='brew services list'
alias mongod-stop='brew services stop mongodb-community'

# restart your terminal
# type mongod in your terminal for run service & mongod-stop for finish it
# test your mongodb connection with
mongo
show dbs
```

Mac version Catalina made the root folder is no longer writable. 

Brew has an updated version of mongodb to use a new path (which it creates itself), `/usr/local/var/mongodb` and following these instructions will fix the issue:

[Guide to installing updated mongodb-community-edition](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/#install-mongodb-community-edition)

`brew install mongodb-community@VERSION` where the first VERSION with the fix is 4.2
