I am currently learning the AWS CLI (v2) and have installed it on Ubuntu 18.04. I am running zsh with oh-my-zsh installed. I am trying to get aws command output to be reported back to the terminal as a JSON string (or even as text), but the output is  redirected to vi.

My AWS account is brand new - no EC2 instances. When I run the following command:

```
aws ec2 describe-instances
```


It sends the expected output value (e.g. { "Reservations": [] }), but directly to vi instead of outputting a JSON string to the terminal requiring closing vi afterwards. This occurs regardless of output format (json, text, table) or what shell I use (bash, zsh). 

I am not sure if this is a AWS CLI configuration issue/change or a shell/Linux configuration issue/change

Thank you for any/all suggestions.

It was the PAGER environment variable set to "less" (which I was confusing with vi).
This fix is to update the ~/.aws/config file and setting cli_pager to an empty value, e.g. :
```
[default]
region = us-west-2
output = json
cli_pager =
```

Thank you to [Sorin](https://stackoverflow.com/users/939457/sorin) who commented on my question lead me to the answer.

Just run your command with `--no-cli-pager` like so
`aws ec2 describe-instances --no-cli-pager`

You can also run a one liner command:
```
aws configure set cli_pager ""
```

in V2:
[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration-changes.html#cliv2-migration-output-pager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cliv2-migration-changes.html#cliv2-migration-output-pager)
> By default, the AWS CLI version 2 returns all output through your operating systemâ€™s default pager program. This program is the less program on Linux or macOS, and the more program on Windows. This can help you navigate a large amount of output from a service by displaying that output one page at a time.

There is a document on AWS with the title [Controlling Command Output from the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-usage-output.html). According to this doc, the correct syntax should be

```
aws ec2 describe-instances --output json
```

I recommend either creating a new user account and/or going into a subshell without profile and trying to run your AWS command again.  For example...

```
username:~$ sudo -u `whoami` bash --noprofile
# Now it drops us into a sub-shell with no /etc/profile or any scripts
bash-3.2$ aws ec2 describe-instances
```


This above drops you into a subshell that doesn't have any profile (/etc/profile or .bash_profile) files included.  It should be pristine.  From here we try your command again, and see what it does.  I would guess here it would work fine and not drop you into VI.  If so, then you need to look elsewhere for what bash/zsh is including (eg: /etc/profile) that is causing this to happen.

 If this does NOT fix your problem, your issue might be in the ~/.aws folder, I would wipe that folder out and start from scratch, re-run `aws configure` and then try your command again.
