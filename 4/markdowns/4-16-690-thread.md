I want to set the environment variable I added below the line to `~/.bash_profile` and `~/.profile` but it didn't work.

```
export JBOSS_HOME=/Users/{USERNAME}/Desktop/jboss7
```


Afterward, exit the terminal and open it again when executing `echo $JBOSS_HOME` I get nothing.

Apple has changed the default shell to zsh. Therefore you have to rename your configuration files. `.bashrc` is now `.zshrc` and `.bash_profile` is now `.zprofile`.

If you for some reason (as me) don't want to rename/move your `~/.bash_profile` file you can do the next things:


1. Create a new file ~/.zprofile
2. Type there source ~/.bash_profile
3. Save and close
4. Run a new terminal session

You can just copy your existing bash_profile and name it zprofile and it will work fine.
- 
`cp ~/.bash_profile ~/.zprofile`

I created a new file called 

`/usr/local/bin/mybash`

which contains a wrapper script:

`/usr/local/bin/bash --init-file $HOME/.bashrc`

I installed this local/bin/bash from [HomeBrew](https://brew.sh).



```
brew install bash
echo "/usr/local/bin/bash --init-file $HOME/.bashrc" > /usr/local/bin/mybash
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mybash
```


Then I opened the settings for `terminal.app` [cmd-comma]. Under the `General` Tab, select the radio button for `Command (complete path)`

In the text box change the text from `/bin/zsh/` to `/usr/local/bin/bash`.

After you close a Terminal window, variables you set in that window are no longer available. If you want the value of a variable to persist across sessions and in all Terminal windows, you must set it in a shell startup script. For information about modifying your zsh shell startup script to keep variables and other settings across multiple sessions, see the “Invocation” section of the [zsh man page](http://x-man-page://zsh).

You can use `~/.zlogin` to add your variables.

Check out [this reference](https://support.apple.com/en-ae/guide/terminal/apd382cc5fa-4f58-4449-b20a-41c53c006f8f/mac).

changing the bash profile to zsh profile works and source it as well to see in action.

```
vikas@Vikas-Kumar ~ % mv .bash_profile .zsh_profile
vikas@Vikas-Kumar ~ % source .zsh_profile
```

You can create a simbolic link and keep your .bash_profile file with this:

```
ln -s .bash_profile .zsh_profile
source .zsh_profile
```


Any changes in .bash_profile will be reflected in .zsh_profile

Even with os Catalina  comes for free, brew is not needed. Simply create your  and set shell in terminal settings to . it automatically finds your .bash_profile.  is not  and simply renaming will work in most cases but definitely is not correct.

you don't need to update the file, zsh is mac's default, put this in terminal. e.g.:
```
export ANDROID_HOME=$HOME/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/emulator
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin
export PATH=$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
```

```
cp zprofile ~/.zprofile
```


Add to `.zprofile`:

```
export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
export LANG=en_US.UTF-8
```


eg. by `>vi .zprofile`

Done
