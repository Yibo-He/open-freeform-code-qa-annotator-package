I would like to print a file in cat << EOF>. e.g.
```
$cat file
ad3
c43
34e
se3
we3
```

My script is:
```
$cat run.sh
cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
cat file #I would like to print the content of the file here
some commands
EOF
```

I can't able to print as desire with `./run.sh`
Desire output
```
$cat test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
ad3
c43
34e
se3
we3
some commands
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

You can use the `$(cat file)` command substitution to include the contents of the file in the script. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will include the contents of the `file` in the `test.sh` script. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create the `test.sh` file with the desired output.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the `$(cat file)` syntax to insert the contents of the file into the script. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will insert the contents of `file` into the script at the location where `$(cat file)` appears. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create `test.sh` with the desired output.

--------

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `cat` command with the file name as an argument inside the `cat << EOF` block to achieve the desired output. Here's an updated version of your script:

```
#!/bin/bash

cat << EOF > test.sh
#!/bin/bash
some commands
$(cat file)
some commands
EOF
```

This will insert the contents of `file` into the `test.sh` script at the position where `$(cat file)` is located. When you run `./run.sh`, it will create the `test.sh` file with the desired output.
