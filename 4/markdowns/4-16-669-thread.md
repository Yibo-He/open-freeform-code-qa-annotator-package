I want to write all files and folders' names into a `.gitignore` file like the below:
```
Folder1
Folder2
File1.bar
File2.foo
```

and so on.
The writing part can be achieved with the `Out-File` command, but I'm stuck in printing those names like the format above.
I'm aware of the command `Get-ChildItem` but it prints out a bunch of metadata like dates and icons too which are useless for the matter. btw, I'm looking for a single-line , not a script.

Just print the `Name` property of the files
```
$ (ls).Name >.gitignore
$ (Get-ChildItem).Name | Out-File .gitignore
```

That's because PowerShell cmdlets output complex objects rather than raw strings. The metadata you're seeing for a file is all attached to a [FileInfo](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.fileinfo) object that describes the underlying file system entry.
To get only the names, simply reference the `Name` property of each. For this, you can use the `ForEach-Object` cmdlet:
```
# Enumerate all the files and folders
$fileSystemItems = Get-ChildItem some\root\path -Recurse |Where-Object Name -ne .gitignore
# Grab only their names
$fileSystemNames = $fileSystemItems |ForEach-Object Name

# Write to .gitignore (beware git usually expects ascii or utf8-encoded configs)
$fileSystemNames |Out-File -LiteralPath .gitignore -Encoding ascii
```

Would this do? 
```
(get-childitem -Path .\ | select name).name | Out-File .gitignore
```
