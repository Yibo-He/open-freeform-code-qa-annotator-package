I am trying to deploy an application to GCP on kubernetes, however, the deployment fails with the error `the job spec is invalid ... the field is immutable`.

In the migration job, I have a section of bash in the following format:

```
args:
        - |
          /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
          CHILD_PID=$!
          (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
          wait 
          if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```


but when the file is executed, in the yaml on GCP I see that the command has been enclosed in quotes and then it returns the above mention error.

So this issue was resolved. I had to wrap the values of the environment variables in the yaml file in quotes. That resolved the issue.

```
- name: DATABASE_URL:
  value: "${DATABASE_URL}"
```

I got the message `the job spec is invalid ... the field is immutable` for a different reason and wanted to briefly share it here.

I was trying to apply this yaml file:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: application-name
...
```


Turns out that this yaml was going to replace a previous version of the same Deployment. When I ran `kubectl get deployment application-name -o yaml` I saw this:

```
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: application-name
      track: stable
...
```


Apparently the `spec.selector.matchLabels` is currently an array, and I was trying to replace that with a single string. My fix was deleting the deployment and re-deploying it.

I got `field is immutable error` when I tried to run jobs in my cluster with the following command:
```
$ kubectl apply -f config.yml
```

where `config.yml` was defined as follows:
```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: my-job-name
spec:
  # (...)
```

It worked for the first time, but the other ones with modified parameters did not.
Turned out the completed job was not deleted automatically and it still figured in the job list:
```
$ kubectl get jobs | grep my-job-name
my-job-name                                              1/1           4m29s      22h
```

So, you have to delete the old one as follows:
```
$ kubectl delete job my-job-name
```

Now you can send a new job with the same name using `kubectl apply -f config.yml`.

If you are using [args](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#define-a-command-and-arguments-when-you-create-a-pod) in a Pod definition it's meant to be an array with single-string items. (It doesn't run the command in a shell) For example:

```
args:
        - /cloud_sql_proxy
        - -instances
        - ...
```


or 

```
args:  [ "/cloud_sql_proxy", "-instances", "..." ]
```


The way to get around this is to [run the command in a shell](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/inject-data-application/define-command-argument-container/#run-a-command-in-a-shell):

```
command: [ "/bin/sh" ]
args: 
        - -c
        - |
          /cloud_sql_proxy -instances=xxxxxxxxxxx:europe-west1:xxxxxxxxxxx=tcp:5432 -credential_file=/secrets/cloudsql/credentials.json -log_debug_stdout=true &
          CHILD_PID=$!
          (while true; do echo "waiting for termination file"; if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then kill ; echo "Killed  as the main container terminated."; fi; sleep 1; done) &
          wait 
          if [[ -f "/tmp/pod/main-terminated" ]]; then exit 0; echo "Job completed. Exiting..."; fi
```


The quotes(") on the array are for readability, they can be no quotes or single quotes(') too (As seen in the [YAML specs](https://yaml.org/spec/1.0/#id2570745))

Hope it helps.
