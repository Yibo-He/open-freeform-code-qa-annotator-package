## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch --show-current
```

This command will display the name of the current branch that your HEAD is pointing to.

If you want to display the branch name in the terminal prompt, you can modify your PS1 environment variable. Here's an example:

```
export PS1='\[\033[01;32m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\]:\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\$ '
```

This will display the current branch name in parentheses at the end of your terminal prompt. You can add this line to your .bashrc file to make it permanent.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2
```

This command will display the current branch name in the terminal. To make it easier to use, you can create an alias in your `.bashrc` file:

```
alias current_branch="git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2"
```

After adding this alias, you can simply type `current_branch` in the terminal to display the current branch name.

Note: This assumes that you are currently in a Git repository. If you are not in a Git repository, the command will not display anything.

To show the current branch name in the VSCode terminal, you can use the following command:

```
git branch | grep \* | cut -d ' ' -f2
```

This command will display the name of the current branch. You can add this command to your PS1 environment variable to display the branch name in your terminal prompt.

To add this command to your PS1 environment variable, you can add the following line to your .bashrc file:

```
export PS1='\u@\h:\w $(git branch 2>/dev/null | grep -e ^* | sed -E s/^\\\\\*\ \(.+\)$/\(\\\\\1\)\ /) $ '
```

This will display the current branch name in parentheses in your terminal prompt.
