I am using trying to build a workflow that will run in PowerShell.  I am setting an environment for my branch name to use in a step for checkout of a different repository.
```
run: |
  $branchName = $Env:GITHUB_REF -replace "refs/heads/", ""
  echo "CURRENT_BRANCH=${branchName}" | Out-File -FilePath $Env:GITHUB_ENV -Encoding utf8 -Append
```

In a later step, I'm trying to pass in the variable:
```
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${env:CURRENT_BRANCH}
```

I've tried different formats involving curly brackets, but I keep getting output from the build that shows that exact text as the path.  I'm not sure sure how to get it to evaluate.
When I do  `${{ env:CURRENT_BRANCH }}` I received the following error:
> The workflow is not valid.
.github/workflows/publish.yml (Line: 54, Col: 14):
Unexpected symbol: 'env:CURRENT_BRANCH'. Located at position 1
within expression: env:CURRENT_BRANCH

The correct syntax to use environment variables in GitHub Actions is `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`. So in your case, it should be `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}`.

Here is the corrected code:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This will correctly evaluate the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable that you set in the previous step.

The correct syntax to access environment variables in GitHub Actions is `${{ env.VARIABLE_NAME }}`. So in your case, it should be `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}`.

Here is the corrected code:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This will properly evaluate the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable that you set in the previous step.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In GitHub Actions, you can access environment variables using the `env` context. However, the syntax you're using is incorrect. You should use `${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}` instead of `${{ env:CURRENT_BRANCH }}`.

Here's the correct way to use it:

```yaml
- name: Checkout repo  
  uses: actions/checkout@v2
  with:
    repository: 'MyOrg/MyRepo'
    ref: ${{ env.CURRENT_BRANCH }}
```

This will correctly reference the `CURRENT_BRANCH` environment variable that you've set in a previous step.
