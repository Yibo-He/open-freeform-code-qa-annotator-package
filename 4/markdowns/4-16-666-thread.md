I want to set tab for zsh autocomplition plugin. There is related part of config:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                tab-char //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```


What is the convention for char names used?
How does tab named?

You will have to put 

```
bindkey '       ' autosuggest-accept
```


into your `.zshrc` file. Notice that the space between the apostrophe is one keystroke of the tab-character.
This works similarly with every other character or character combination. If you for example wanted to put a combination of the `ctrl`+`space` keys to trigger the acception, you'd append 

```
bindkey '^ ' autosuggest-accept
```


to the file.

Here's a link to the Configuration-file, where this is explained: [https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions#key-bindings](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions#key-bindings)

For all of you that are struggling with the accepted answer, I got it to work doing the following:
```
bindkey '^I' autosuggest-accept
```

...where '^I' is tab.

this seems to work as expected in your `~/.zshrc`:
```
bindkey '\t' autosuggest-accept
```

In the `.zshrc` file:
```
bindkey '^I'   complete-word       # tab          | complete
bindkey '^[[Z' autosuggest-accept  # shift + tab  | autosuggest
```
