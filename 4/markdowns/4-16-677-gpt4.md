```
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi '$searchT') ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT' && wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep '$searchT')

else echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

How do I make the script run if the `if statement` is true. when i run the script the script will output the `else` statement. because there is no value to compare with the grep command.

The issue is with the single quotes around the variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, meaning your variable isn't being expanded. You should use double quotes instead.

Here's the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

This script will now correctly substitute the value of the variable `$searchT` into the `grep` command. If matches are found in `test.txt`, it will print the number of matches and the matching lines. If no matches are found, it will print "no match found".

The issue is with the single quotes around the variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. Single quotes in bash will prevent variable expansion, meaning the actual value of the variable will not be used. You should use double quotes instead. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    
fi

exit 0
```

In this corrected script, the variable `$searchT` is properly expanded within the `grep` command. Also, I moved `wc -l` to correctly count the number of matches.

The issue is that you are using single quotes around your variable `$searchT` in your `grep` command. In bash, single quotes preserve the literal value of all characters within the quotes, which means your variable is not being expanded to its value. 

You should use double quotes instead, which will allow for variable expansion. Here is the corrected script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "enter search term here: " searchT

if [[ $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT") ]]; then     
    echo "$(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT" | wc -l) number of matches found"
    echo $(cat test.txt | grep -wi "$searchT")

else 
    echo "no match found"    

fi

exit 0
```

In this script, `grep -wi` is used to ignore the case and match the whole words. The `wc -l` command is used to count the number of lines. The `grep` command inside `echo` is used to print the matching lines.
