I'm creating a list of values, in a context where it so happens that, though the values are being added one at a time, the eventual number is known in advance. This is in a function that will be called many times, so the faster it runs, the better.

In Java, I would use the ArrayList constructor that specifies an initial capacity, because in theory this makes it slightly faster because it avoids resizing.

In Kotlin, one normally uses mutableListOf(), but this does not allow an initial capacity; in theory this should result in slightly slower code.

Is the recommended/idiomatic Kotlin solution in this case:


1. Go ahead and use the ArrayList constructor; ArrayList is a perfectly valid MutableList.
2. Ignore the issue; the initial capacity never actually makes a measurable difference to speed.
3. Something else?

## GPT4 Attempt \#0

In Kotlin, you can indeed use the ArrayList constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This is a perfectly valid approach and can help to optimize your code by avoiding unnecessary resizing operations. Here is an example:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

This is similar to how you would do it in Java. While Kotlin provides its own collection functions like `mutableListOf()`, these are designed for convenience and readability, and may not always offer the best performance in every situation.

So, in answer to your question, option 1 is the recommended approach in this case. However, it's worth noting that the performance gain from specifying an initial capacity is usually quite small, and may not be noticeable unless you're dealing with very large lists or performance-critical code.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

In Kotlin, you can use the ArrayList constructor with an initial capacity, just like in Java. This is perfectly valid and idiomatic Kotlin code. Here's how you can do it:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

This way, you can avoid the overhead of resizing the list if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This can lead to performance improvements, especially if the list is large.

However, keep in mind that the performance gain might not be significant for smaller lists or in situations where the exact size of the list is not known in advance. In such cases, using `mutableListOf()` is simpler and more idiomatic. 

So, the answer is a combination of options 1 and 2: use the ArrayList constructor with an initial capacity when you know the size in advance and performance is a concern, otherwise, just use `mutableListOf()`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

In Kotlin, you can indeed use the ArrayList constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements in advance. This can help avoid the overhead of resizing the array.

Here is how you can do it:

```kotlin
val list = ArrayList<Int>(initialCapacity)
```

This is perfectly valid and idiomatic Kotlin code. The ArrayList class in Kotlin is a MutableList, so you can use all the MutableList methods with it.

However, whether this will make a measurable difference to speed depends on the specific circumstances. If the list is very large and you're doing a lot of adding, it could make a difference. But for smaller lists, the difference is likely to be negligible.

So, the answer is a combination of options 1 and 2. Use the ArrayList constructor with an initial capacity if you know the eventual number of elements and the list is large. Otherwise, it's probably not worth worrying about.
