I feel like I'm missing something very basic, but this example SwiftUI code will not modify the view (despite the Binding updating) when the button is clicked

[Tutorials](https://medium.com/flawless-app-stories/swiftui-understanding-binding-8e20269a76bc?) I have read suggest this is the correct way to use a binding and the view should refresh automatically

```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    @State static var selected: Bool = false

    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
    }
}
```

The code you've posted is correct in terms of using `@Binding` and `@State` in SwiftUI. However, the issue you're facing is likely due to how you're using the `ContentView` in your app. 

The `ContentView_Previews` struct is only used for SwiftUI's Preview feature in Xcode, and won't actually run when you launch your app. This means that the `@State` variable `selected` is not actually being used when you run your app, only when you're previewing the `ContentView` in Xcode.

To fix this, you need to create a `@State` variable in the parent view that uses `ContentView`, and pass it as a `@Binding` to `ContentView`. Here's an example:

```swift
struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        ContentView(isSelected: $isSelected)
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` is the parent view that uses `ContentView`. It has a `@State` variable `isSelected`, which it passes as a `@Binding` to `ContentView`. When `isSelected` changes in `ContentView`, it will also change in `ParentView`, causing both views to update.

The code you provided is correct, but it seems like you're trying to use it in a standalone way. The `@Binding` property wrapper is used to create a two-way connection between a property that stores data, and a view that displays and changes the data. 

In your case, `isSelected` is a binding variable in `ContentView` which means it doesn't own the data but it can read and write it. The owner of the data is the `selected` state property in `ContentView_Previews`.

The problem is that you're trying to use `ContentView` alone. It needs to be used as a part of another view which provides the binding. Here is an example of how you can use it:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ParentView: View {
    @State private var selected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            ContentView(isSelected: $selected)
            Text("Current selection: \(selected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @Binding var isSelected: Bool

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ParentView()
    }
}
```

In this example, `ParentView` is the owner of the data and it passes a binding to this data to `ContentView`. When you click the button in `ContentView`, it updates the `selected` state in `ParentView` and the text in `ParentView` changes accordingly.

The code you posted is almost correct. The problem is that you're trying to use `@Binding` in the main `ContentView`. `@Binding` is used when you want to create a two-way connection between a variable in a child view and a source of truth in a parent view. 

In your case, you should use `@State` in the `ContentView` because it's the source of truth. Then, if you had a child view that needed to modify `isSelected`, you would pass it as a `@Binding`.

Here's the corrected code:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var isSelected: Bool = false

    var body: some View {
        Button(action: {
            self.isSelected.toggle()
        }) {
            Text(isSelected ? "Selected" : "Not Selected")
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `@State` is used to create a source of truth for `isSelected` in `ContentView`. When `isSelected` changes, SwiftUI automatically refreshes the view.
