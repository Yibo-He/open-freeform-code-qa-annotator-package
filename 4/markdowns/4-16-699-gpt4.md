I am trying to parse a string variable where everything after -354 gets cut off.
I have variables that look like this: NameOfFile-354-XX.pdf
Where NameOfFile can be any length and -XX can be anything or not even there at all.
I want the print of this variable to be: NameOfFile-354
How do I cut the variable so it cuts after -354?
What I have tried so far:
```
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $n.lastIndexOf('-354'))
}
```

I want the output to be this:
```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

Thank you for your help.

You are on the right track, but the `lastIndexOf` method is not the best choice here because it returns the starting index of the last occurrence of the specified string, not the ending index. 

Instead, you can use the `split` method to split the string at '-354', then take the first part and append '-354' back to it. Here's how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $split = $n.Split('-354', 2)
     Write-Host ($split[0] + '-354')
}
```

This will give you the output you want:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

This code works by splitting each string into two parts at the first occurrence of '-354'. The first part (`$split[0]`) is the part before '-354', and the second part (`$split[1]`) is the part after '-354'. We then print the first part with '-354' appended back to it.

The `lastIndexOf` method returns the last index of the specified string, which is not what you want in this case. You want to find the index of `-354` and then add 4 to it (to include `-354` in the substring). 

Here is how you can do it:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $index = $n.IndexOf("-354")
     if($index -ne -1) {
         Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $index+4)
     }
}
```

This script will output:

```
Name1-354
Name23-354
Name354-354
Name3545-354
```

This script works by finding the index of `-354` in each string, and then using the `Substring` method to get a substring from the start of the string to the end of `-354`. If `-354` is not found in the string, `IndexOf` returns `-1`, and in that case, we don't print anything.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The `lastIndexOf` function will return the index of the last occurrence of the specified string, which is not what you want in this case. Instead, you want to find the index of the first occurrence of "-354" and everything after it. You can use the `indexOf` function to achieve this.

Here is the corrected code:

```powershell
$FileArray = @("Name1-354-03.pdf", "Name23-354-H11.pdf", "Name354-354-02.pdf", "Name3545-354.pdf")
ForEach ($n in $FileArray){
     $index = $n.indexOf('-354')
     if ($index -ne -1) {
         Write-Host $n.Substring(0, $index+4)
     }
}
```

In this code, `indexOf('-354')` will return the index of the first occurrence of "-354". We add 4 to this index to include "-354" in the substring. If "-354" is not found, `indexOf` will return -1, so we only call `Substring` if `indexOf` returns a non-negative value.
