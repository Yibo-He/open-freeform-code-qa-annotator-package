I am trying to filter my json file using bash, which file could be something like:
```
{
    "key1": [],
    "key2":["first_value","second_value"]
}
```

In case I would like to fetch key1 and key2 I got I can do something like:
```
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1")'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

The output of the previous is:
```
Output:

Item : []
```

This prevents any issues in the case my file hasn't such key and I want to verify that.
How can I verify that values is empty, referred to my example?
I want to avoid any iteration on empty values.
Is there any way to verify the existing key with jq, that should not be empty?
The goal I would like to achieve is something like 
```
key2:
- first_value
- second_value
```

in case of key, since it is empty I don't want to have any results

You can use the `length` function in `jq` to check if the array is empty or not. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1")' && jq '.key1 | length > 0'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1[]" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

This script first checks if the key "key1" exists in the JSON file and then checks if the array under "key1" is not empty. If both conditions are true, it will iterate over the items in the array.

For "key2", you can do the same:

```bash
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key2")' && jq '.key2 | length > 0'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key2[]" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

This will output:

```
Item : first_value
Item : second_value
```

Note: The `[]` after `.key1` and `.key2` in `jq -r ".key1[]" "$my_json"` and `jq -r ".key2[]" "$my_json"` is used to iterate over the array items.

You can use the `length` function in `jq` to check if the array is empty. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1") and (.key1 | length > 0)'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1[]" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

In this script, `jq 'has("key1") and (.key1 | length > 0)'` checks if the key "key1" exists and if the array under "key1" is not empty. If both conditions are true, it will return `true`, otherwise `false`.

Also, note that I've changed `.key1` to `.key1[]` in the `values` assignment. This is because `.key1` will return the whole array as a single string, while `.key1[]` will return each item in the array as a separate string, which is what you want for the loop.

You can do the same for "key2":

```bash
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key2") and (.key2 | length > 0)'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key2[]" "$my_json")

  for item in $values
  do
    echo "Item : $item"
  done
fi
```

This will print:

```
Item : first_value
Item : second_value
```

You can use the `length` function in `jq` to check if the array under the key is empty or not. Here is how you can do it:

```bash
if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key1") and .key1 | length > 0'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key1[]" "$my_json")

  echo "key1:"
  for item in $values
  do
    echo "- $item"
  done
fi

if $(cat $my_json | jq 'has("key2") and .key2 | length > 0'); then
  values=$(jq -r ".key2[]" "$my_json")

  echo "key2:"
  for item in $values
  do
    echo "- $item"
  done
fi
```

This script will first check if the key exists and if the array under the key is not empty. If both conditions are true, it will print the key and the values under the key. If the array under the key is empty, it will not print anything.
