How can I detect from a shell script that it is running on M1 Apple hardware?
I want to be able to run a command-line command so that I can write an `if`-statement whose body will only be executed when run on a mac with an M1 processor (and at least macOS Big Sur, naturally).

```
uname -m
```

will return `arm64` as opposed to `x86_64`
```
if [[ $(uname -m) == 'arm64' ]]; then
  echo M1
fi
```

or, as @chepner suggested
```
uname -p
```

will return `arm` as opposed to `i386`
```
if [[ $(uname -p) == 'arm' ]]; then
  echo M1
fi
```

yet another tool is `arch`:
```
if [[ $(arch) == 'arm64' ]]; then
  echo M1
fi
```

I found that `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` reported `Apple M1` even though the process was run under Rosetta.
: be prepared for `Apple M1 Pro`, `Apple M2` etc.!

When using the native shell say `/bin/bash -i` or `/bin/zsh -i`, [Klas Mellbourn's](https://stackoverflow.com/users/46194/klas-mellbourn) [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/65259353/130638) works as expected.
If using a shell that was installed via an Intel/Rosetta Homebrew installation, then `uname -p` returns `i386`, and `uname -m` returns `x86_64`, as indicated by [Datasun's](https://stackoverflow.com/users/8308743/datasun) [comment](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65259300/detect-apple-silicon-from-command-line/68148776?noredirect=1#comment116043166_65259353).

To get something that works across environments (Apple Silicon Native, Rosetta Shell, Linux, Raspberry Pi 4s), I use the following from the [dorothy dotfile ecosystem](https://github.com/bevry/dorothy):
```
is-mac && test "$(get-arch)" = 'a64'
```

If you aren't using dorothy, the relevant code from dorothy is:

```
test "$(uname -s)" = "Darwin"
```

```
arch="$(uname -m)"  # -i is only linux, -m is linux and apple
if [[ "$arch" = x86_64* ]]; then
    if [[ "$(uname -a)" = *ARM64* ]]; then
        echo 'a64'
    else
        echo 'x64'
    fi
elif [[ "$arch" = i*86 ]]; then
    echo 'x32'
elif [[ "$arch" = arm* ]]; then
    echo 'a32'
elif test "$arch" = aarch64; then
    echo 'a64'
else
    exit 1
fi
```

[Jatin Mehrotra's](https://stackoverflow.com/users/13126651/jatin-mehrotra) [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/67996219/130638) on [a duplicate question](https://stackoverflow.com/q/67996157/130638) gives details on how to get the specific CPU instead of the architecture. Using `sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string` outputs `Apple M1` on my M1 Mac Mini, however outputs the following on a Raspberry Pi 4 Ubuntu Server:
```
> sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
Command 'sysctl' is available in the following places
 * /sbin/sysctl
 * /usr/sbin/sysctl
The command could not be located because '/sbin:/usr/sbin' is not included in the PATH environment variable.
This is most likely caused by the lack of administrative privileges associated with your user account.
sysctl: command not found

> sudo sysctl -n machdep.cpu.brand_string
sysctl: cannot stat /proc/sys/machdep/cpu/brand_string: No such file or directory
```
