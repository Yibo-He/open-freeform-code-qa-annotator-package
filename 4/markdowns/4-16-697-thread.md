I have a docker file as below. `launch.sh` is the entry point in this docker image. 

```
FROM ubuntu:16.04
USER root

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
        curl \
        vim \
        net-tools \
        git \
        iputils-ping \
        wget

RUN apt-get install -y python
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y gcc g++ make libgflags-dev libsnappy-dev zlib1g-dev libbz2-dev liblz4-dev libzstd-dev

RUN curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install 7.9.0 && npm install -g npm@5.6.0

ADD ./Docker/launch.sh /workspace/

CMD ["/bin/sh", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


The content of `launch.sh` is:

```
#!/bin/bash

cd /workspace/demo
npm install
node index.js
```


when I run the docker container: `docker run IMAGE_NAME`, I got this error:

```
npm: not found
node: not found
```


The `node` in this image is managed by `nvm` which has been installed and its script has been set on `/root/.bashrc` file. But I don't know why it can't find the nodejs commands. But if I run the container by `docker run -it IMAGE_NAME bash`, then manually run `workspace/launch.sh` command, everything works fine. It seems the `~/.bashrc` is not executed when run the image. How can I let the container source .bashrc?

The content of `/root/.bashrc` is:

```
# ~/.bashrc: executed by bash(1) for non-login shells.
# see /usr/share/doc/bash/examples/startup-files (in the package bash-doc)
# for examples

Each command runs a separate sub-shell, so the environment variables are not preserved and `.bashrc` is not sourced (see [this answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/54961370/dockerfile-an-appended-variable-is-not-persisted-between-run-instructions/54961726#54961726)).

You have to source your script manually  where you run your command so it would be:

```
CMD source /root/.bashrc && /workspace/launch.sh
```


provided your `launch.sh` is an executable. 

As per [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) `exec` form you are using does not invoke a command shell, so it won't work with your `.bashrc`.


## Edit:



BASH wasn't your default shell so

```
CMD /bin/bash -c "source /root/.bashrc && /workspace/launch.sh"
```


was needed in order to run your script.
If you want yo set your shell as BASH by default, you can use `SHELL` instruction as described [in documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#shell), e.g.:

```
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
```

None of the existing answers accurately answer the title question: `~/.bashrc`
There are two things to be aware of:

## Use login shell


According to the [bash man page](https://linux.die.net/man/1/bash):
> When  is invoked as an interactive login shell, or as a non-interactive shell with the , it first reads and executes commands from the file , if that file exists. After reading that file, it looks for , , and , in that order, and reads and executes commands from the first one that exists and is readable. The  option may be used when the shell is started to inhibit this behavior.
Therefore, in order to have `.profile`/`.bashrc` read automatically upon invocation of `bash`, it is necessary to invoke `bash` with the `--login` or `-l` option.
You can do this in a couple ways:
`-l` For example,
```
SHELL ["/bin/bash", "-l", "-c"]
```

`-l` using the [exec form of RUN](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run):
```
CMD ["/bin/bash", "-l", "-c", "/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


## Note top of .bashrc


From the man page above, we know the order in which profile files are searched and loaded. If you look at `/root/.profile` you may see something like this:
```
# ~/.profile: executed by Bourne-compatible login shells.

if [ "$BASH" ]; then
  if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
    . ~/.bashrc
  fi
fi

mesg n 2> /dev/null || true
```

This is how `~/.bashrc` gets source for a `bash` shell. Therefore, we can expect `~/.bashrc` to be sourced when the `bash` shell is used.
However, look carefully near the top of your `.bashrc` file:
```
# If not running interactively, don't do anything
[ -z "$PS1" ] && return
```

This means that effectively the remaining contents of `.bashrc` are ignored except for  shells.
One answer suggests using the `-i` option of `bash` to invoke an interactive shell. This does work because the environment variable `PS1` is set for interactive shells, and therefore `.bashrc` continues.
However, perhaps you don't want an interactive shell. In this case, there are a few options:
 You can use something like this in your `Dockerfile`:
```
RUN sed -e '/[ -z "$PS1" ] && return/s/^/#/g' -i /root/.bashrc
```

This modification to `.bashrc` will prevent its early exit from non-interactive invocations.
`nvm``.profile` Move the last three lines of your `.bashrc` file to `.profile` so they're executed unconditionally.
`.bashrc` As other answers have already noted, you can certainly manually source `.bashrc` as needed, as in,
```
RUN source /root/.bashrc && /workspace/launch.sh
```

Observe that much of the content of `.bashrc` makes the most sense for interactive shells and is usually unnecessary otherwise, which may make option 2 above the most appealing.

with CMD and shell form
```
CMD /bin/bash -i "/workspace/launch.sh"
```


should also work with ENTRYPOINT and and using exec form using
```
ENTRYPOINT ["bash","-i","/workspace/entrypoint.sh"]
```

I believe the -i flag works in the intended way, the .bashrc file is used as intended, the other solutions did not work for me, the .bashrc file was never used
solution may not be ideal for everyone, with the -i flag the program may prompt for user interaction
ps: I used docker create and docker start -i "container name"

You can add `source /path/to/bashrc` in `launch.sh` and change the `CMD` to the following instead of changing to bash through `CMD` itself:

```
CMD ["/workspace/launch.sh"]
```


Alternatively, You can do the following in your Dockerfile instead of depending on `bashrc`

```
ENV NVM_DIR /root/.nvm
ENV NODE_VERSION 7.9.0
ENV NODE_PATH $NVM_DIR/v$NODE_VERSION/lib/node_modules #Ensure that this is the actual path
ENV PATH $NVM_DIR/versions/node/v$NODE_VERSION/bin:$PATH
RUN . $NVM_DIR/nvm.sh && \
  nvm install $NODE_VERSION && npm install -g npm@5.6.0
```
