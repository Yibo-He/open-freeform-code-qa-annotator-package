## Update


By looking at the processes under Task Manager, I was able to locate the installer for Service Fabric Runtime (the first of the two components that are attempted installed below, and apparently the one that fails).
I found the file and tried to run it from Powershell (after first removing the Service Fabric folder that had been created during my previous attempt). The result is shown below: Apparently it starts the installation process, then freezes and stops, and times out after 10 minutes with no further explanation.
```

### Original question:


I'm not sure if this is a valid question for SO, as it relates to the setup of a dev tool/system, rather than a programming question directly, but I hope you'll let it pass, as I think it might be useful for other programmers too:
([Service Fabric GitHub Repository](https://github.com/microsoft/service-fabric/issues/1307#issue-1107996432)).

### Failing to install Service Fabric SDK


This is on Windows 10 (version 10.0.19044)
I downloaded the installer from the offical site ( [https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started) ) and ran it, as I've done previously on a different PC with no issues.

### The result this time was as follows:

Looking at the  of the two logs, I get (among other stuff) this:
```

Commandline is: 'C:\Users\*MyUserName*\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Web Platform Installer\installers\ServiceFabricRuntime_8_2_CU1\B9FBB56A2D94EADC21BE8863FF10FE681EC8348E\MicrosoftServiceFabric.8.2.1363.9590.exe /AcceptEULA'.

DownloadManager Warning: 0 : Dependency failed for product 'Microsoft Azure Service Fabric SDK - 5.2.1363'. Skipping install
```

Looking at the  of the log files, I get this:

```

I tried to locate the additional logs mentioned (`C:\WINDOWS\TEMP\FabricSetupLog.Uninstall_637781913748003856.log`), but no such log file exists at that location. The only log files I have been able to find are the ones referred to above (located under `c:\windows\Temp`).
I also tried following the "Direct download" link in the web installer (see below), but this only confirms that the Service Fabric Runtime is required first.
![03_direct_download](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13332708/150122256-6c64acdd-157c-4c09-b157-cab7b2836712.png)

Any tips that might help me track down the underlying issue here would be greatly appreciated.
 (update after comment below)
I realize there appears to be an issue with files remaining from a previous installation. One of the log files mentions the folder `C:\program files\ServiceFabric`. This folder is indeed created when I try to install, but I have removed it manually before attempting again. I've done this multiple times, and restarted my PC between this and reinstallation attempts too, just to be sure. In short, I can't find any trace of Service Fabric, yet it still tells me that it is failing to uninstall. Just to be on the safe side, I've also tried removing Visual Studio completely too, in case there was some link/dependency on it somehow, but I still get the same result.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It seems like there might be some leftover files from a previous installation of Service Fabric that are causing the issue. Even though you have manually removed the `C:\program files\ServiceFabric` folder, there might still be some registry keys or other files that are causing the installation to fail.

One thing you could try is to use the Service Fabric CleanUp tool to completely remove any traces of Service Fabric from your system. You can download the tool from the Microsoft Download Center: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54989

After running the CleanUp tool, try to install Service Fabric again and see if the issue persists. If it does, you could try to manually search for any remaining Service Fabric files or registry keys and remove them.

Another thing to try is to run the installation as an administrator. Right-click on the installer and select "Run as administrator" to see if this makes any difference.

If none of these solutions work, you could try to contact Microsoft support for further assistance. They might be able to provide more specific guidance on how to resolve the issue.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like there might be some leftover files from a previous installation of Service Fabric that are causing the issue. Even though you have manually removed the `C:\Program Files\ServiceFabric` folder, there might be other files or registry entries that are causing the problem.

One thing you could try is using the Service Fabric Cleanup Tool, which is designed to remove all traces of Service Fabric from your system. You can download it from the Microsoft Download Center here: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54989

Once you have downloaded and run the cleanup tool, try installing Service Fabric again and see if that resolves the issue.

If that doesn't work, you could try manually removing any remaining Service Fabric files and registry entries. Microsoft has provided instructions for doing this here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-troubleshoot-deployment-issues#clean-up-service-fabric-installation

Be sure to follow the instructions carefully and make a backup of your registry before making any changes.

If none of these solutions work, you could try reaching out to Microsoft support for further assistance.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like there might be some leftover files from a previous installation that are causing the issue. Even though you have manually removed the `C:\program files\ServiceFabric` folder, there might be some registry entries or other files that are still present on your system.

You could try using a tool like CCleaner to clean up any leftover registry entries or files related to Service Fabric. Additionally, you could try running the installation with administrative privileges to ensure that all necessary files are being installed correctly.

If none of these solutions work, you could try reaching out to the Service Fabric support team for further assistance. They might be able to provide more specific guidance on how to resolve this issue.
