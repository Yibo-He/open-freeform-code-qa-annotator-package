I would like to initialise the value of a `@State` var in SwiftUI through the `init()` method of a `Struct`, so it can take the proper text from a prepared dictionary for manipulation purposes in a TextField.
The source code looks like this:
```
struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    @State var fullText: String = ""

    init(letter: String) {
        self.fullText = list[letter]!
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField($fullText)
    }
}
```

Unfortunately the execution fails with the error `Thread 1: Fatal error: Accessing State<String> outside View.body`
How can I resolve the situation? Thank you very much in advance!

The error you're seeing is because `@State` variables are designed to be managed by SwiftUI, and you're not supposed to change them outside of the SwiftUI view's body. 

However, you can use a different property wrapper, `@StateObject`, to create a custom ObservableObject that can be initialized with a value. Here's an example:

```swift
class TextModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var fullText: String

    init(fullText: String) {
        self.fullText = fullText
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]

    @StateObject var textModel: TextModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _textModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: TextModel(fullText: list[letter] ?? ""))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $textModel.fullText)
    }
}
```

In this example, `TextModel` is a class that conforms to `ObservableObject` and has a `@Published` property `fullText`. You can initialize `TextModel` with a value for `fullText`, and SwiftUI will observe changes to `fullText` and update the view as needed.

The error you're seeing is because you're trying to access a `@State` variable outside of the `body` property. `@State` variables are designed to be used within the SwiftUI view's `body` property, and SwiftUI doesn't allow them to be accessed elsewhere.

However, you can use a different property wrapper, `@StateObject`, to achieve your goal. `@StateObject` is designed to be initialized in the `init()` method and can be used to store complex data that will survive for the lifetime of your view.

Here's how you can modify your code:

```swift
class TextModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var fullText: String
    
    init(letter: String) {
        self.fullText = letter
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    
    @StateObject var textModel: TextModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _textModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: TextModel(letter: list[letter]!))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $textModel.fullText)
    }
}
```

In this code, `TextModel` is a class that conforms to `ObservableObject` and has a `@Published` property `fullText`. This property will automatically notify the view to update whenever it changes. We initialize `TextModel` with the desired letter in the `init()` method of `StateFromOutside` and store it in a `@StateObject` property. Then we bind `TextField` to `textModel.fullText` so that it displays and updates the text.

The `@State` property wrapper is designed to be used and modified within the view's body, and SwiftUI doesn't allow it to be modified outside of the body. This is why you're getting the error.

However, you can use a different property wrapper, `@StateObject`, which can be initialized in the `init()` method. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
class TextModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var text: String
    init(text: String) {
        self.text = text
    }
}

struct StateFromOutside: View {
    let list = [
        "a": "Letter A",
        "b": "Letter B",
        // ...
    ]
    
    @StateObject var textModel: TextModel

    init(letter: String) {
        _textModel = StateObject(wrappedValue: TextModel(text: list[letter] ?? ""))
    }

    var body: some View {
        TextField("Enter text", text: $textModel.text)
    }
}
```

In this code, `TextModel` is a class that conforms to `ObservableObject` and has a `@Published` property `text`. This class is used to initialize `textModel` in the `init()` method of `StateFromOutside`. The `TextField` then uses `textModel.text` as its binding.

This way, you can initialize the text from your dictionary in the `init()` method and use it in the `TextField`.
