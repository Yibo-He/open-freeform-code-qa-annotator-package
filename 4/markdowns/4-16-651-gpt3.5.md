[This answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/14676852/7437143) explains that normally a git commit SHA is generated based on various parameters. However, I would like to know: 
For example, suppose one wants to create and push a commit to Git with the following sha:
```
1e23456ffd118db9dc04caf40a442040e5ec99f9
```

(For simplicity, assume one can assume it is a unique sha).
The XY-problem is a manual mirror script between two different Git servers. It would be more convenient to simply have identical commit SHA's than to keep a mapping of the commits between the Git servers. This is because the manual mirror is more efficient (saving computation time and server bandwidth) if I can skip certain commits from the `source` server. Yet that means the parent commits change in the `target` server, with respect to the same commit in the `source` server. In turn, that would imply the SHA changes, which would require me to keep track of a mapping of the sha's in the `source` and `target` server. In short, it would be more convenient to simply override the sha's of the commits to the `target` server, than to ensure the two servers have the exact same commits (for the few commits that are actually mirrored).

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

It is not recommended to manually set the commit SHA in Git as it is generated based on various parameters such as the commit message, author, timestamp, and parent commit SHA. Changing any of these parameters will result in a different commit SHA. 

If you want to keep the same commit SHA in both the source and target servers, you can use the `git cherry-pick` command to apply the changes from the source server to the target server. This will create a new commit with a different SHA but with the same changes as the original commit. 

Alternatively, you can use a Git tool like `git filter-branch` to rewrite the commit history and change the commit SHA. However, this is a complex and risky operation that can cause issues with the repository's history and should only be done with caution. 

In summary, it is not recommended to manually set the commit SHA in Git. Instead, you can use Git tools like `git cherry-pick` or `git filter-branch` to achieve your desired outcome.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It is not recommended to manually set the commit SHA in Git as it is generated based on various parameters such as the content of the commit, the parent commit(s), the author, the committer, and the timestamp. Manually setting the SHA could potentially cause conflicts and issues with the Git repository.

If you want to mirror a Git repository, it is recommended to use Git's built-in mirroring functionality such as `git clone --mirror` or `git remote add --mirror`. This will ensure that the two repositories have identical commits and commit SHAs.

If you still want to manually set the commit SHA, you can use the `git commit-tree` command. This command allows you to create a new commit object with a specific SHA and parent commit(s). However, this should only be used in exceptional cases and with caution as it can cause issues with the Git repository.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It is not recommended to manually set the commit SHA in Git as it is generated based on various parameters such as the contents of the commit, the parent commit(s), the author and committer information, and the timestamp. Manually setting the SHA can cause conflicts and issues with Git's internal data structures.

Instead, you can use Git's cherry-pick feature to apply a specific commit from the source server to the target server. This will create a new commit with a new SHA, but it will have the same changes as the original commit. You can then use the cherry-picked commit's SHA as the reference for the manual mirror script.

To cherry-pick a commit, you can use the following command:

```
git cherry-pick <commit-SHA>
```

Replace `<commit-SHA>` with the SHA of the commit you want to apply to the target server. This will create a new commit with a new SHA, but it will have the same changes as the original commit.

Note that if the commit you are cherry-picking has any conflicts with the target branch, you will need to resolve them manually before the cherry-pick can be completed.
