I have a file `file1` which ends with
`Success...` OR
`success...`
I want to `grep` for the word `success` in a way which is not case sensitive way.
I have written the following command but it is case sensitive
```
cat file1 | grep "success\.\.\."
```

How can i change it so that it `returns 0` with both `Success...` OR
`success...`

You can use the `-i` option with `grep` to make the search case-insensitive. Here's the modified command:

```
cat file1 | grep -i "success\.\.\."
```

This will match both `Success...` and `success...`. The `-i` option tells `grep` to ignore case when searching.

This will match both `Success...` and `success...`. The `-i` option tells `grep` to ignore case when searching for the pattern.
