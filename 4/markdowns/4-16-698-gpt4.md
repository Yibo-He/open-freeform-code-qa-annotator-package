How to restart my current MacOS terminal session without closing the window?
In Linux I use `exec bash` but it does not work in this environment. I made a few changes to the `.bash_profile` (prompt, alias etc) I would like to see without closing it and opening again.

You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `source ~/.bash_profile` and press Enter.

This will apply any new changes you've made to your `.bash_profile` in your current terminal session. 

If you are using zsh (which is default in newer versions of macOS), the command would be `source ~/.zshrc`.

You can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, it will apply those changes to your current terminal session.

If you're using a different shell like zsh, and you've made changes to `.zshrc`, you would use:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

Remember, this won't "restart" your terminal session, but it will apply any new changes you've made to your shell configuration file.

In MacOS, you can use the `source` command to reload your `.bash_profile` without closing and reopening your terminal. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
source ~/.bash_profile
```

This command will read and execute commands from the filename argument in the current shell context. If you made changes to your `.bash_profile`, it will apply those changes to your current terminal session.

Note: If you're using zsh (which is the default in macOS Catalina and later), you should modify `~/.zshrc` instead of `~/.bash_profile`, and you can reload it with `source ~/.zshrc`.
