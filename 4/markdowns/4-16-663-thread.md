From [this Answer (here)](https://stackoverflow.com/a/72246808/10343144), I believe there may not be a way to do this using globbing.

# tl;dr


I need:
- - `ls``sed``cp``cat``chown``rm`- - - 
I'm using `grep` & `ls` only as examples, but I need a glob expression that applies to other commands also.
- `grep -r --include=GLOB``cp``grep`- `find``grep``|``while do;`

## Examples


Suppose I have these files, all containing "find me":
```
./file1.js
./file2.php
./inc/file3.js
./inc/file4.php
./inc.php/file5.js
./inc.php/file6.php
```

I need to match only/all  one time:
```
./file2.php
./inc/file4.php
./inc.php/file6.php
```


## Duplicates returned: shopt -s globstar; ... **/*.php


This changes the problem; it does not solve it.

### Dup: ls


 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`ls **/*.php` returns:
```
inc/file4.php
inc.php/file5.js
inc.php/file6.php
```

- 
 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`ls **/*.php` returns:
```
file2.php
inc/file4.php
inc.php/file6.php

inc.php:
file5.js
file6.php
```

- 

### Dup: grep


 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`grep -R "find me" **/*.php` returns:
```
inc/file4.php: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
```

- 
 entering `shopt -s globstar` as a single command...
`grep -R "find me" **/*.php` returns:
```
file2.php: find me
inc/file4.php: find me
inc.php/file5.js: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
inc.php/file6.php: find me
```

- - `ls`

## Current solution: faulty misuse of && logic


```
grep -r "find me" *.php && grep -r "find me" */*.php
ls -l *.php && ls -l */*.php
```

- `I fail here && so I never happen`

## Desired solution: single command via globbing


```
grep -r "find me" [GLOB]
ls -l [GLOB]
```

## Insight from grep


`grep` does have the `--include` flag, which achieves the same result but using a flag specific to `grep`. `ls` does not have an `--include` option. This leads me to believe that there is no such glob expression, which is why `grep` has this flag.

With shell globing it is possible to only get directories by adding a `/` at the end of the glob, but there's no way to exclusively get files (`zsh` being an exception)

##### Illustration:


With the given tree:
```
file.php
inc.php/include.php
lib/lib.php
```

Supposing that the shell supports the non-standard `**` glob:
- `**/*.php/` expands to `inc.php/`- `**/*.php` expands to `file.php inc.php inc.php/include.php lib/lib.php`- For getting `file.php inc.php/include.php lib/lib.php`, you  use a glob.
`zsh``**/*.php(.)`

##### Standard work-around (any shell, any OS)


The POSIX way to recursively get the files that match a given  glob and then apply a command to them is to use `find -type f -name ... -exec ...`:
- `ls -l <all .php files>`
```
find . -type f -name '*.php' -exec ls -l {} +
```

- `grep "finde me" <all .php files>`
```
find . -type f -name '*.php' -exec grep "finde me" {} +
```

- `cp <all .php files> ~/destination/`
```
find . -type f -name '*.php' -type f -exec sh -c 'cp "$@" ~/destination/' _ {} +
```

`~/destination/``find``find -exec ... {} ~/destination/ +`

With bash, you can first do a `shopt -s globstar` to enable recursive matching, and then the pattern `**/*.php` will expand to all the files in the current directory tree that have a .php extension.
zsh and ksh93 also support this syntax. Other commands that take a glob pattern as an argument and do their own expansion of it (like your `grep --include`) likely won't.

Suggesting different strategy:
Use explicit `find` command to build `bash` command(s) on the selected files using `-printf` option.
Inspect the command for correctness and run.

#### 1. preparing bash commands on selected files


```
find . -type f -name "*.php" -printf "cp %p ~/destination/ \n"
```


#### 2. inspect the output, correct command, correct filter, test


```
cp ./file2.php ~/destination/
cp ./inc/file4.php ~/destination/
cp ./inc.php/file5.php ~/destination/
```


#### 3. execute prepared find output


```
bash <<< $(find . -type f -name "*.php" -printf "cp %f ~/destination/ \n")
```
