#### Metadata:

Area: `Mobile and Desktop Apps`

Language: `kotlin` (full parsed tag list: `kotlin`)

----------

**Notepad**


----------

In [Stripe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stripe_(company)), my client wants email and cardholder name, but the Stripe payment UI doesn't provide that option in `com.stripe.android.view.CardMultilineWidget`. I wanted to give it a try with the latest stripe version,

1. I was using Stripe version (14.1.1). So I updated it to the latest one (16.8.0)
2. The build showed me the error that it doesn't take minSdkVersion 19. It requires 21 in manifest merger. So I updated minSdkVersion to 21.
3. I got caches/transforms-2/files-2.1/4541b0189187e0017d23bbb0afebd16a/jetified-kotlin-stdlib-common-1.5.0.jar!/META-INF/kotlin-stdlib-common.kotlin_module: Module was compiled with an incompatible version of Kotlin. The binary version of its metadata is 1.5.1, expected version is 1.1.15.


I tried changing the Gradle version, but I am still getting the same error. How can I solve the incompatible error and add the email and cardholder name in Stripe?

Changing this in file `build.gradle` solved my problem.
From
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'
```

to
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.0'
```

Or whatever the latest version of Kotlin [available](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html#release-details) and make sure to update Kotlin version on Android Studio as well.

## Although this question has been answered, I think it's worth explaining what is happening


For the example:
```
The binary version of its metadata is 1.7.1, expected version is 1.5.1.
```

The `expected` version is the Kotlin for `kotlin-gradle-plugin`
The `binary` version is the what is downloaded (or previously compiled)
for `com.android.tools.build:gradle`

```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.20' // <= expected version is 1.5.1
}
dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.3.1' // downloads 1.7.1 Metadata
    classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version" // <= 1.5.20 used here
```


## Why is this Happening So Much?



1. The user updates the Kotlin version of the plugin to match the IDE version per the warning.


[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/wDkl5.png)

1. The user updates the android build tools gradle plugin per the warning


[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/mGxr8.png)

Now you don't have any warnings, but the version suggested is `7.1.3` which is not the latest. (I don't know why it suggests this older version) `7.3.1` is currently the latest and is meta data `1.7.1`, so it will match the Kotlin version of `1.7.20` (which is also metadata `1.7.1`)

## What else could be wrong?


Due to caching, gradle may be using an older dependency before you updated. To start clean:

1. delete the ~/.gradle/cache directory
2. delete the android/.gradle directory
3. delete the project_dir/build dir
4. ensure the android/gradle/gradle-wrapper.properies has the correct distributionUrl (currently distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-7.4-bin.zip)
5. from project_dir do flutter build apk


NOTE: your dependencies may need to be updated if their `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version is too old. Alternatively, both the kotlin and `tools:gradle` versions can be downgraded to compatible version that match metadata (although Android Studio will warn for that not matching the IDE Kotlin version)

## How to Prevent this from happening Again?


- Use the same Kotlin version as the IDE normally for `ext.kotlin_version`. see [https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html#release-details](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/releases.html#release-details)- Double check the `com.android.tools.build:gradle` version. See [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#updating-gradle) and [https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools.build/gradle?repo=google](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.android.tools.build/gradle?repo=google)

I had this problem in a Flutter project.
In my case, a line for  was missing in the Android  file, so adding `ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'` didnâ€™t fix it.
After adding
`classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"`
the error was gone.
Full code section:
```
buildscript {
    ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'
    repositories {
        google()
        mavenCentral()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
        classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    }
}

If you are facing this error in Flutter build for Android then try to change the Kotlin version to
`ext.kotlin_version = '1.4.32'`

Firstly, go to settings, and then navigate to plugins. Find the Kotlin plugin and update it.
Next, in gradle files, go to  (Project: YourApp). Then, change the following code (in buildscript) from:
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'
```

to the latest version, such as:
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.4.32'
```

To know the latest version, go to settings and the plugins, find the Kotlin plugin, and make sure it is updated. The latest version is under JetBrains.
After following the instructions, your error will be resolved.

Make sure that the Kotlin version of your IDE is the same as the version declared in your gradle.build file.

It was fixed by updating the Kotlin Gradle plugin version.
In the project level  file, update the following line.
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'
```

You can find the latest Kotlin Gradle plugin version at
[Tools / Build tools / Gradle](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle.html).

What do you need to to solve this?
I was facing this issue since last night. Just navigate through some webpages couldn't get to the exact solution. I finally solved it by these steps:
- `ext.kotlin_version = '1.3.50'``ext.kotlin_version = '1.4.32'`-

in my case for
> The binary version of its metadata is 1.7.1, expected version is 1.5.1
got to (dependencies) inside build.gradle(project) convert from `1.5.x` (x) in my case is (20)
```
classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.5.20"
```

to `1.7.10`
```
classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.7.10"
```

Another solution is to downgrade `androidx.core:core-ktx` library to any compatible version. This one worked for `kotlin_version = '1.3.31'`:
```
dependencies {
    implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-stdlib-jdk7:$kotlin_version"
    implementation 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat:1.3.1'  // The only working for this version (sdk/gradle)
    implementation 'androidx.core:core-ktx:1.0.2' // The only working for this version (sdk/gradle)
    implementation 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:1.1.2' // higher versions require min-sdk >= 26
    ...
}
```

Android SDK: `compileSdkVersion 30` and `minSdkVersion 19`.
Gradle build Tool: `com.android.tools.build:gradle:3.3.1`.

Just go to file  (Project: yourProjectName).

```
plugins {
  ...

  id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' version '1.5.x' apply false

  ...
}
```

(1.5.x means x version number at your case, such as 1.5.1.)

```
plugins {
  ...

  id 'org.jetbrains.kotlin.android' version '1.7.10' apply false

  ...
}
```

It works in my case...

Most of the answers here seem to revolve around projects that use Gradle.
I randomly encountered this problem in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA) that that was compiling and running a Maven project just fine 5 minutes before - no configuration changes. I introduced a new exception class and this problem popped up.
I tried invalidating caches and restarting, which didn't resolve the issue - however, disabling and re-enabling the Kotlin plugin resolved the issue.

Using Flutter, it was fixed by:
- Updating Android Studio packages, specially the Kotlin plugin.- Get the last Kotlin plugin version Nbr from [Gradle - Plugin and versions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/gradle.html#plugin-and-versions). For now it's 1.6.10.- Update  file by replacing the old Kotlin version by the new one you got from the web site above.`ext.kotlin_version = '<The_new_version_Nbr>'` `ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'`- Restart Visual Studio Code.
You're done.

Go to the file build.gradle, change the version of kotlin.
In case in my flutter project I opened build.gradle and changed
```
`ext.kotlin_version = '1.5.30'`
```

to
`ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.0'`
Here
```
buildscript {
ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.0'

repositories {
    google()
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:4.1.0'
    classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:$kotlin_version"
    
}
```

}

---


Then save and do
`flutter clean` and `flutter run`.
Works fine for me.

I faced the same problem in  and I fixed it by going to:
 as @Muzzamil said and I checked for the version of Kotlin in my IDE and simply replaced the value in ext.kotlin_version  (that is 1.6.10) by that value
```
ext.kotlin_version = '1.6.10'
```

app/build.gradle:
```
dependencies {
   //  classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:7.1.2'
   //  classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle- plugin:$kotlin_version"
   }
```

But after changes ext.kotlin_version to lower this warning stay but the red warning is gone

I have faced this error in [IntelliJ IDEA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IntelliJ_IDEA) with a Maven project.
The solution is about to turn off Kotlin plugin in IntelliJ IDEA if you are not using Kotlin in your project.
Go to:
Menu  â†’  â†’ 
And turn off the Kotlin plugin by click on the checkbox. See here:
