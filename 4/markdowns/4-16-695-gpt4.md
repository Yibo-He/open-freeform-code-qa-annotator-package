I just got a MacBook from work and I am using it to build docker images. Usually, the docker build shows the full log (i.e. `ls -la` showing the cwd). Thats at least what I'm used to from my linux machine.
On the macbook however, it only shows a brief overview: (actual console output)

Steps 7 and 15 are supposed to show me the results, but this is just omitted. (I know, its the cached result, but it didn't show up, when  I changed the Dockerfile and rebuild the layer as well).
setting `--progress=plain`  didn't do any good. In fact it just changed the color from purple to white (HideThePainHarold.jpg).
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

The behavior you're seeing is due to Docker's build output changes in recent versions. Docker now uses a new build output format called BuildKit by default, which is more efficient and concise but does not show the full output of each command by default.

To get the full output, you can disable BuildKit by setting the environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` before running your build command. Here's how you can do it:

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
docker build .
```

This will revert to the old build output format and should show the full output of each command.

Alternatively, if you want to keep using BuildKit but see the full output of specific commands, you can use the `RUN` instruction with a `||` (OR) operator to ensure the command's output is shown even if the command is successful. Here's an example:

```Dockerfile
RUN ls -la || true
```

This will run `ls -la`, and then run `true` regardless of whether `ls -la` succeeded or failed. Since `true` is a command that always succeeds, the `RUN` instruction will always succeed. But because `ls -la` might fail, Docker will show its output to help you debug the potential error.

The Docker build output on macOS is a bit different from Linux. The Docker build process on macOS is more abstracted because Docker runs in a virtual machine, not directly on the host OS. This can sometimes lead to differences in behavior.

However, the issue you're facing seems to be related to the Docker build cache. When Docker builds an image, it caches the result of each step. If you run the build again, Docker will use the cached results for steps that haven't changed, which speeds up the build process. This is why you're seeing "CACHED" before each step in your output.

When a step is cached, Docker doesn't show the output of the command. This is why you're not seeing the output of `ls -la`. If you want to see the output of these commands, you need to make sure they're not cached.

One way to do this is to add a dummy argument before the command that changes each time you run the build. For example, you could change your Dockerfile like this:

```
RUN echo "Build time: `date`" && ls -la
```

This will print the current date and time before running `ls -la`. Since the date and time change every minute, this will prevent Docker from using the cache for this step, so you'll see the output of `ls -la` each time you run the build.

Another way to avoid using cache is to use the `--no-cache` option when running `docker build`. This will force Docker to run all steps of the build process, even if they haven't changed:

```
docker build --no-cache -t your-image-name .
```

Please note that this will slow down your build process, as Docker has to run all steps from scratch.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The Docker build output on macOS is a bit different from Linux due to the way Docker works on macOS. Docker runs inside a virtual machine on macOS, and the Docker CLI communicates with the Docker Engine inside this VM. This can sometimes lead to differences in behavior.

The output you're seeing is the new BuildKit output, which is more concise and easier to read. However, it doesn't show the output of each command by default, especially for cached layers.

If you want to see the full output of each command, you can disable BuildKit by setting the environment variable `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0` before running `docker build`. This will revert to the old build output.

Here's how you can do it:

```bash
export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0
docker build .
```

This should show the full output of each command, including the `ls -la` commands.

However, keep in mind that BuildKit has several advantages over the old builder, like better caching, parallel builds, and more. So you might want to switch back to it once you're done debugging. You can do this by setting `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` or just closing and reopening your terminal session.
