I can not understand what could be the problem

i have some Json 
for example is 

```
[
{
    "id": 1,
    "title": "Title",
    "info": "info",
    "brand": "brand",
    "model": "MODEL",
    "make_year": year,
    "properties": [
        {
                "id": 1,
                "icon": "ic_rgb",
                "label": "color",
                "value": "red"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "icon": "ic_car",
                "label": "type",
                "value": "value"
            },
            {   "id": 3,
                "icon": "ic_fuel",
                "label": "fuel",
                "value": "gas"
            }  
        ],
    },
{
    "id": 2,
    "title": "title2",
    "message": "massage2",
    "info": "wow you are amazing, thanks for the help",
    "properties": [
        {
                "id": 11,
                "icon": "ic_rgb",
                "label": "2color",
                "value": "2blue"
            },
            {
                "id": 21,
                "icon": "ic_car",
                "label": "2type",
                "value": "2cgh"
            },
            {   "id": 31,
                "icon": "ic_fuel",
                "label": "fuel",
                "value": "test"
            },
            ....
        ],
}
]
```


and my model 

```
struct Unicards: Hashable, Codable, Identifiable {
var id: Int
var title: String?
var info: String?
var brand: String?
var model: String?
var make_year: Int?
var messege: String?
var messege_color: String?
var price: String?
var price_currency: String?
var price_tooltip: String?


var properties: [HPropert]?
struct HPropert: Hashable, Codable, Identifiable {

    var id: Int
    var icon: String?
    var label: String
    var value: String

}
```


and what the problem... i'm trying to create forEach method for horizontal collection for properties 

I partially succeeded, I implemented this method with a nested array, and it even generates the number of cells correctly. wow!)

but when I want to assign values ​​for the text by index it gives an error ...

I actually can not understand the problem, since the array has already been calculated and created by the number of cell objects.

but when I ask the formula to assign values ​​I get 

```
Cannot convert value of type '[Unicards.HPropert]' to expected argument type 'Range<Int>'
```


my code below 

```
struct Card_cell_rowOfCheracteristics: View {

var data2: Unicards

var body: some View {
    let properties = data2.properties!

    return    VStack() {
//            Text("thanx bro!. have a nice day")
//                .font(.system(size: 14))
//                .font(.headline)
//                .fontWeight(.light)
//                .multilineTextAlignment(.leading)

        ScrollView(Axis.Set.horizontal) {



            HStack {


                ForEach(properties) { card in <--- Cannot convert value of type '[Unicards.HPropert]' to expected argument type 'Range<Int>'
                    VStack {
                        Image()
                            .resizable()
                            .scaledToFit()
                            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)


                        VStack {

                            Text(properties[card].label) 
                                .font(.system(size: 14))
                                .fontWeight(.medium)
                            Text(properties[card].value)
                                .font(.system(size: 14))
                        }


                    }
                }
            }
        }

    }
}

struct Card_cell_rowOfCheracteristics_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Card_cell_rowOfCheracteristics(data2: PlatesData[0])
    }
}
}
```


but if i say 

```
properties[0].label
```


no errors occur


----------

The error is occurring because you are trying to use `card` as an index to access elements in `properties`. However, `card` is not an index, it's an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`.

In your `ForEach` loop, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert` that you are iterating over. So, you don't need to use it as an index to access `properties`. You can directly use `card.label` and `card.value`.

Here is the corrected code:

```swift
ForEach(properties) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

In this corrected code, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert` that you are iterating over in the `ForEach` loop. You can directly access its `label` and `value` properties.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue you're experiencing is due to the way you're trying to access the properties array. In your ForEach loop, `card` is not an index, it's an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`. So when you're trying to use `card` as an index, it's causing an error.

Here's how you can fix it:

```swift
ForEach(properties, id: \.self) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

In this code, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`, so you can directly access its `label` and `value` properties. Also, please note that you need to make sure your `Unicards.HPropert` conforms to `Hashable` protocol to use it in `ForEach` loop.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue is that you're trying to use `card` as an index, but in the context of your `ForEach`, `card` is not an index, it's an element of `properties`.

In your `ForEach` loop, `card` is an instance of `Unicards.HPropert`, not an index. So when you're trying to use `card` as an index in `properties[card].label` and `properties[card].value`, you're getting an error because `card` is not an integer.

You should directly use `card.label` and `card.value` instead of `properties[card].label` and `properties[card].value`. Here's the corrected code:

```swift
ForEach(properties) { card in
    VStack {
        Image()
            .resizable()
            .scaledToFit()
            .frame(width: 34, height: 34)

        VStack {
            Text(card.label) 
                .font(.system(size: 14))
                .fontWeight(.medium)
            Text(card.value)
                .font(.system(size: 14))
        }
    }
}
```

This should resolve the error you're seeing.
