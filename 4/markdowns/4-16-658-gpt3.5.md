I'm trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019 (Docker Desktop does not work here, my VPS does not support Hyper-V).
I run this in PowerShell (all in Administrator mode)
`docker run -it --isolation=process mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t`
Then I get error:
> docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect.: Post http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.24/containers/create: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified.
See 'docker run --help'.
I ran command `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon`, as suggested here: [Docker cannot start on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40459280/docker-cannot-start-on-windows)
However, `DockerCli.exe` does not exist in a clean Docker install:

As [suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179462/where-do-i-find-dockercli-exe) I tried copying the file `DockerCli.exe` from my local Windows 10 Docker Desktop installation and reran, but then I get:
> Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Docker.Core, Version=3.0.0.50646, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Run(IReadOnlyCollection`1 args)
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Main(String[] args)
Regardless, copying files from Docker Desktop does not feel like the right approach.
I then ran `dockerd` in PowerShell since that's the only other executable in that folder:

Since I'm a newbie, I'm not sure if I just started a container and if so, which one, I just see `start.`, but no idea where that comes from or how I can configure it.

Based on Peter Wishart's suggestion I tried `uninstall-Package -Name docker`, but then I get
```
uninstall-Package : No package found for 'docker'. At line:1 char:1
+ uninstall-Package -Name docker

   , Exception

Here's the full code of what I tried:

It seems like you are facing multiple issues while trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019. Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. Docker installation: It looks like you have installed Docker using the DockerMsftProvider package provider. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling Docker using the following commands in PowerShell:

```
uninstall-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
```

Make sure to answer "Yes" when prompted to install software from an untrusted source.

2. Docker daemon: The error message you received indicates that the Docker client cannot connect to the Docker daemon. You can try starting the Docker daemon manually using the following command in PowerShell:

```
dockerd
```

This should start the Docker daemon and allow you to run Docker commands.

3. Docker CLI: The `DockerCli.exe` file is not included in a clean Docker installation. It is part of the Docker Desktop installation on Windows. You can try copying the `DockerCli.exe` file from your local Windows 10 Docker Desktop installation to your Windows Server 2019 machine and see if it helps.

4. Process isolation mode: Once you have Docker up and running, you can try running your container in process isolation mode using the following command:

```
docker run -it --isolation=process mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t
```

This should start a container running the `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019` image and execute the `ping` command inside the container.

I hope these suggestions help you resolve your issues with running Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

It seems like you are facing multiple issues while trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019. Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. Docker installation: It seems like you have installed Docker using the DockerMsftProvider package provider. You can try uninstalling and reinstalling Docker using the following commands:

```
uninstall-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider
```

Make sure to run these commands in an elevated PowerShell prompt.

2. Docker daemon: The error message you are seeing suggests that the Docker client is not able to connect to the Docker daemon. You can try starting the Docker daemon manually using the following command:

```
dockerd
```

This should start the Docker daemon and you should see some output in the console. Once the daemon is running, you can try running your Docker command again.

3. DockerCli.exe: As you have mentioned, copying files from Docker Desktop does not seem like the right approach. DockerCli.exe is not included in a clean Docker installation, and it is not recommended to copy it from another installation. Instead, you can try using the Docker command-line interface (CLI) that comes with Docker. You can access the Docker CLI by running the `docker` command in an elevated PowerShell prompt.

I hope these suggestions help you resolve your issues with running Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like you are facing multiple issues while trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019. Here are some suggestions that might help you:

1. Elevated privileges issue:
The error message suggests that you need to run the Docker client with elevated privileges to connect to the daemon. You can try running PowerShell as an administrator and then run the Docker command.

2. DockerCli.exe issue:
As you mentioned, copying files from Docker Desktop does not seem like the right approach. Instead, you can try uninstalling and reinstalling Docker on your Windows Server 2019 machine. To uninstall Docker, you can use the following PowerShell command:

   `uninstall-Package -Name docker`

   After uninstalling, you can install Docker using the following PowerShell command:

   `Install-Package -Name docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider`

   This should install the latest version of Docker on your machine.

3. Docker daemon issue:
When you ran `dockerd` in PowerShell, it started the Docker daemon. However, it seems like you are not sure which container it started. You can use the following command to list all running containers:

   `docker ps`

   This should give you a list of all running containers along with their container IDs, names, and other details.

I hope these suggestions help you resolve your issues and run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019.
