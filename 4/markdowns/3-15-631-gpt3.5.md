I have created a VBA code to remove all special characters available in a column. As an example I have a Alphanumeric character with some special characters in every cells of a column:
Suppose in a cell I have a value: abc@123!-245
After executing my code I got output abc 123 245
Here my code is working fine to remove all the special characters. My code is given below:
```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

Now if I want to remove the space for my output so that output should look like abc123245, how to do that in VBA?
Input: abc@123!-245
Current Output: abc 123 245
Required Output: abc123245

To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional line of code to remove the spaces. Here's the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, we added a line `strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")` after the loop that removes special characters. This line uses the `Replace` function to replace all spaces with an empty string, effectively removing them from the string.

To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional line of code to remove the spaces. Here is the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, the `Replace` function is used to remove all spaces from the string after the special characters have been replaced with spaces. The `Replace` function takes two arguments - the first argument is the string to be searched for spaces, and the second argument is the string to replace the spaces with (in this case, an empty string). The modified code will now output the string without any spaces.

To remove the spaces from the output, you can modify the code by adding an additional line of code to remove the spaces. Here's the modified code:

```
Sub ReplaceSpecial()
    Dim cel As Range
    Dim strVal As String
    Dim i As Long
    Application.ScreenUpdating = False
    For Each cel In Selection
        strVal = cel.Value
        For i = 1 To Len(strVal)
            Select Case Asc(Mid(strVal, i, 1))
                Case 32, 48 To 57, 65 To 90, 97 To 122
                    ' Leave ordinary characters alone
                Case Else
                    Mid(strVal, i, 1) = " "
            End Select
        Next i
        ' Remove spaces from the string
        strVal = Replace(strVal, " ", "")
        cel.Value = strVal
    Next cel
    Application.ScreenUpdating = True
End Sub
```

In this modified code, after the special characters are replaced with spaces, the `Replace` function is used to remove the spaces from the string. The resulting string is then assigned back to the cell value.
