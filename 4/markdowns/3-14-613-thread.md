I see others post with issues using SwiftUI Previews in Xcode 11 and 12, but have not seen this issue elsewhere.
Older project that worked in Xcode 11, loaded in Xcode 12, fails to launch the preview, no matter how simple the Preview content.
Actual preview code:
```
struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        Text("I heart Xcode")
            .previewDevice("iPhone 11")
    }
}
```

After clicking "Resume" or "Try Again":
> CouldNotFindInputNodeInBuiltGraphError<XcodeGraphSource,
PreviewInstance>: Preview 1 of "Content View Previews" not found in
any targetsPreview 1 of "Content View Previews" must belong to at least one
target in the current scheme in order to use previewsElement: PreviewInstance(destinationDescription:
UVPreviewPipeline.AnyPreviewDestinationDescription(storage:
UVPreviewPipeline.(unknown context at
$1382211e0).AnyPreviewDestinationDescriptionBoxImpl<UVIntegration.SimulatorPreviewDestinationDescription>),
previewIdentity: UVPreviewPipeline.PreviewIdentity(identifier:
ContentView_Previews[0], description: contentType: Element
contextType: application device: iPhone 11 index: 0 layout: device
supportsLive: true supportsOnDevice: true), variant: nil,
variantedIdentifier: ContentView_Previews[0], identifier:
AnyHashable(ContentView_Previews[0]))
I only have one target, same as before, with no special configuration. I have tried reloading Xcode as well as copying all sources files to a new directory (saw that one somewhere).
Anyone else able to parse this error message or make a recommendation for how to fix SwiftUI previews?
Thanks.

By chance, I recognized why the previews were broken in my from-scratch-project. Reason was the "Versioning" build phase that I originally added during setup:
`xcrun agvtool next-version -all`
After wrapping that into a Previews check, everything's fine again:
```
if [ $ENABLE_PREVIEWS == "NO" ]
then
    xcrun agvtool next-version -all
fi
```

My scenario and resolution is different for the above.
I encountered this error today when I moved all my views into a 'Views' group folder. Then my latest view would not generate a preview and xcode displayed the error reported.
> Preview provider "Your View" must belong to at least one target in the
current scheme in order to use previews
This error was pointing to an existing view I wasn't currently working on, but it was an opened tab.
I closed all the tabs with views that I had open prior to file restructuring. I then reopen the view I was working on and xcode began redisplaying previews.

My case, I moved to another group folder, but I solved clicking on:
file right click > Delete > Remove Reference
Then I added back again to the project:
file/folder right click > Add Files to "Project Name"...

This error occurs whenever we move the View File one place to another place simply you Need to Restart the Xcode then check the
Preview section in my case it is successfully run.

Removing the reference and adding the file back to the Xcode worked for me.

I had this issue after moving some views to group folders, the issue was resolved after restarting Xcode.

In my case, I have a separate package where I add reusable components built with SwiftUI, which later can be used in the project.
I had this error with Previews, until I noticed that my current selected target in XCode was not the target of the current package where I was working on.
Selecting that to the current one fixed the problem.

I had the same error.
FIX: Close all XCode tabs, clean data, and restart xcode
