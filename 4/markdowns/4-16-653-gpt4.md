I have data in a file where one column is a date column which has date in the following format:
```
2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-14T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-19T18:25:00.000+0100
```


```
10 MAY 2021
14 MAY 2021
19 MAY 2021
```


```
while -r read line
do
    year=`echo $line | awk '{ print $1 }' `
    month=`echo $line | awk '{ print $2 }' `
    dt=`echo $line | awk '{ print $3 }' `

    v=$dt"-"$month"-"$year
    d=date '`$v' | dd-mm-yyyy
    echo $d
done < /f/filename.txt
```

The script you provided has a few issues. Here's a corrected version using `date` command in bash:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    d=$(date -d"$line" +"%d %b %Y" | awk '{ print $1 " " toupper($2) " " $3 }')
    echo $d
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line from the file `filename.txt`. For each line, it treats the line as a date string and converts it into the format `day month year`, where month is in uppercase. The result is then printed.

Please replace `filename.txt` with your actual file path.

Note: This script assumes that the date command on your system supports the `-d` option for parsing date strings. This is true on most Linux systems, but not on all Unix-like systems. If this script doesn't work for you, please provide more information about your system.

The script you provided is not correct. Here is a corrected version using the `date` command in bash:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    date=$(echo $line | awk -F"T" '{ print $1 }')
    formatted_date=$(date -d"$date" +"%d %b %Y")
    echo $formatted_date
done < filename.txt
```

This script reads each line from the file `filename.txt`. For each line, it splits the line at the "T" character to get the date part. Then it uses the `date` command to convert the date to the desired format.

Please replace `filename.txt` with your actual file path.

This script assumes that the date command on your system supports the `-d` option for specifying a date string. If it doesn't, you may need to use a different method to parse the date.

Your script seems to be on the right track, but there are a few issues. The `while -r read line` is incorrect, it should be `while IFS= read -r line`. Also, the `date` command is not used correctly. Here's a corrected version of your script:

```bash
while IFS= read -r line
do
    year=$(echo "$line" | awk -F"T" '{ print substr($1,1,4) }')
    month=$(echo "$line" | awk -F"T" '{ print substr($1,6,2) }')
    day=$(echo "$line" | awk -F"T" '{ print substr($1,9,2) }')

    case "$month" in
        "01") month="JAN" ;;
        "02") month="FEB" ;;
        "03") month="MAR" ;;
        "04") month="APR" ;;
        "05") month="MAY" ;;
        "06") month="JUN" ;;
        "07") month="JUL" ;;
        "08") month="AUG" ;;
        "09") month="SEP" ;;
        "10") month="OCT" ;;
        "11") month="NOV" ;;
        "12") month="DEC" ;;
    esac

    echo "$day $month $year"
done < /f/filename.txt
```

This script reads the file line by line, splits the date into year, month, and day, converts the month from a number to a three-letter abbreviation, and then prints the date in the desired format.
