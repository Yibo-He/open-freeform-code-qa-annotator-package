I want to set tab for zsh autocomplition plugin. There is related part of config:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                tab-char //my line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```


What is the convention for char names used?
How does tab named?

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

The convention for character names used in Zsh is to use the name of the character preceded by "self-insert-". For example, the character "a" would be named "self-insert-a". 

In the provided config, "tab-char" is used to refer to the tab key. This is a custom name given to the tab key for the purpose of the Zsh autocompletion plugin.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

The convention for character names used in Zsh is to use the name of the character preceded by "self-insert-". For example, the character "a" would be named "self-insert-a". 

In the provided code, "tab-char" is used to refer to the tab key. This is the convention used in Zsh for the tab character.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

The convention for character names used in Zsh is to use the name of the character preceded by "self-insert-". For example, the character "a" would be named "self-insert-a". 

In the case of the tab character, it is named "self-insert-tab". Therefore, you can replace "tab-char" with "self-insert-tab" in your config to set the tab key as an accept widget for the Zsh autosuggest plugin. 

Here's the updated code:

```
# Widgets that accept the entire suggestion
(( ! ${+ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS} )) && {
        typeset -ga ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS
        ZSH_AUTOSUGGEST_ACCEPT_WIDGETS=(
                forward-char
                end-of-line
                self-insert-tab // updated line
                vi-forward-char
                vi-end-of-line
                vi-add-eol
        )
}
```
