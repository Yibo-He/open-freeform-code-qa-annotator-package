Just playing with Swift UI basic app and the preview canvas is not showing even though I'm in canvas mode. App runs, and I have this little snippet what am I missing?

```
#if DEBUG
struct ContentView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
       ContentView()
    }
}
#endif
```

The code snippet you provided looks correct for SwiftUI preview. However, there could be several reasons why the preview canvas is not showing up:

1. **Xcode Version**: Make sure you are using Xcode 11 or later, as SwiftUI is not supported in earlier versions.

2. **macOS Version**: Make sure you are running macOS Catalina or later. SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina to run.

3. **Device Compatibility**: Make sure the device selected in the preview is compatible with your app. For example, if your app is only for iPhone, selecting an iPad for the preview might cause issues.

4. **Canvas Visibility**: Make sure the canvas is visible. You can toggle the canvas visibility by pressing Option + Command + Return.

5. **Clean Build Folder**: Sometimes, cleaning the build folder can solve the issue. You can do this by going to `Product > Clean Build Folder`.

6. **Restart Xcode**: If none of the above work, try restarting Xcode. Sometimes, Xcode can have issues that can be resolved by a simple restart.

If you're still having issues, it would be helpful to see the rest of your code to diagnose the problem.

There could be several reasons why the preview canvas is not showing in SwiftUI:

1. **Xcode Version**: Make sure you are using Xcode 11 or later, as SwiftUI is not supported in earlier versions.

2. **macOS Version**: Make sure you are using macOS Catalina or later. SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina to run.

3. **Device Compatibility**: SwiftUI requires iOS 13.0 or later. Make sure your target device is compatible.

4. **Canvas Visibility**: Make sure the canvas is visible. You can toggle the canvas visibility by pressing `Option + Command + Return`.

5. **Live Preview**: If you are running the live preview, it might take some time to load. If it's taking too long, try stopping and starting the live preview again.

6. **Clean and Rebuild**: Sometimes, cleaning the project (`Shift + Command + K`) and rebuilding it (`Command + B`) can solve the issue.

7. **Restart Xcode**: If none of the above solutions work, try restarting Xcode. Sometimes, Xcode can have glitches that can be resolved by a simple restart.

If you've checked all of these and you're still having issues, there might be a problem with your SwiftUI code. Please share the code so I can help you debug it.

If your SwiftUI preview is not showing up, there could be several reasons for this. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot:

1. **Check your macOS and Xcode versions**: SwiftUI requires macOS Catalina and Xcode 11 or later. Make sure your software is up to date.

2. **Check your device and OS in the preview**: Make sure you're previewing for a device that supports SwiftUI. Also, ensure that the OS version in the preview is compatible with SwiftUI.

3. **Try to resume the preview**: Sometimes, the preview might not show up because it's paused. You can resume it by clicking on the "Resume" button in the top-right corner of the canvas.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project**: You can do this by going to "Product" > "Clean Build Folder" and then "Product" > "Build" in the Xcode menu.

5. **Restart Xcode**: Sometimes, Xcode might have a glitch that can be fixed by simply restarting the software.

6. **Check your code for errors**: If there are any errors in your code, the preview might not show up. Make sure your code compiles without errors.

7. **Try creating a new SwiftUI file**: If none of the above steps work, try creating a new SwiftUI file and see if the preview shows up there. If it does, there might be something wrong with your original file.

If you're still having trouble, please provide more information about your setup (macOS version, Xcode version, etc.) and any error messages you're seeing.
