I am trying to get language code from pages by curl
I wrote below and work...
```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

but sometimes code is different like
```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep "lang=" | head -1 | cut -d ' ' -f 3 | cut -d"\"" -f 2
```

they wrote like
```
<html dir="rtl" lang="he-IL">
```

I just need to get `he-IL`
If is there any other way, I would appreciate it...

Instead of using `grep` and `cut` to extract the language code, you can use `awk` to extract the value of the `lang` attribute directly. Here's an example command that should work for both cases:

```
curl -Ls yahoo.com | awk -F 'lang=| ' 'NR==1{print $2}' | tr -d '"'
```

This command uses `awk` to split the input by either `lang=` or a space character, and then prints the second field of the first line (which should be the `lang` attribute value). The `tr` command is then used to remove the double quotes around the value.

You can replace `yahoo.com` with any other URL to test this command.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use a regular expression to extract the language code from the HTML content. Here's an example using `grep` and `sed`:

```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP 'lang="\K[^"]+' | sed -n '1p'
```

This command searches for the `lang` attribute in the HTML content using a regular expression. The `-o` option tells `grep` to output only the matched text, and the `-P` option enables Perl-compatible regular expressions. The `\K` escape sequence resets the match start, so that only the language code is captured. The `[^"]+` pattern matches one or more characters that are not a double quote, which corresponds to the language code.

The output of `grep` is then piped to `sed`, which extracts the first line of the output using the `-n` option and the `1p` command. This is necessary because `grep` may match multiple lines, and we only want the first one.

This command should work for most cases, but keep in mind that it relies on the `lang` attribute being present and correctly formatted in the HTML content. If the page uses a different attribute or format to specify the language, this command may not work.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use a regular expression to extract the language code from the HTML code. Here's an example using `grep` and `sed`:

```
curl -Ls stick-it.app | grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+' | sed -n 1p
```

Explanation:

- `grep -oP '(?<=lang=")[^"]+'` searches for the string `lang="` and extracts all characters that follow until the next double quote.
- `sed -n 1p` prints only the first line of the output (in case there are multiple matches).

This should work for both cases where the language code is written as `lang="he-IL"` or `lang="he_IL"`.
