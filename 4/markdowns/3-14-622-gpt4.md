I am looking to conform to ShapeStyle, the goal is just conforming to ShapeStyle(Nothing more and nothing less).
Here is my code and the issue:
```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}

struct RedView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

So I know I could use `Color.red` directly instead of a view, but as I said, the goal of this question is conformation to ShapeStyle. For those going to share apple developer link about ShapeStyle, I have to say I was there before.
Error:
> Instance method 'fill(_:style:)' requires that 'RedView' conform to 'ShapeStyle'

The error is because `fill(_:)` method expects a type that conforms to `ShapeStyle` protocol. `Color` is a type that conforms to `ShapeStyle`, but `RedView` is not. 

To conform `RedView` to `ShapeStyle`, you can create a custom `ShapeStyle` struct that wraps your `RedView`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedShapeStyle())
    }
}

struct RedShapeStyle: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

In the above code, `RedShapeStyle` is a custom `ShapeStyle` that applies `Color.red` to the shape. Now you can use `RedShapeStyle` to fill your `Circle`.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The error message is telling you that the `fill` method requires a `ShapeStyle` as its parameter, but you're trying to pass a `View`. `Color.red` is a `ShapeStyle`, but `RedView` is a `View`.

To conform to `ShapeStyle`, you can make `RedView` a `ShapeStyle` instead of a `View`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}

struct RedView: ShapeStyle {
    func _apply(to shape: inout _ShapeStyle_ShapeType) {
        Color.red._apply(to: &shape)
    }
}
```

In this code, `RedView` is a `ShapeStyle` that applies `Color.red` to the shape it's used with. Now you can use `RedView()` as a `ShapeStyle` in your `fill` method.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message is telling you that the `fill(_:)` method expects a type that conforms to the `ShapeStyle` protocol. In SwiftUI, `Color` is a type that conforms to `ShapeStyle`, but your custom `RedView` does not.

To make your `RedView` conform to `ShapeStyle`, you need to implement the required methods of the `ShapeStyle` protocol. However, `ShapeStyle` is not a protocol designed to be conformed to by your custom types. It's more of an 'umbrella' protocol for several types provided by SwiftUI, like `Color`, `Gradient`, etc.

If you want to use a custom view as a fill for a shape, you can use the `fill(_:content:)` method, which takes a `ShapeStyle` and a closure that returns a `View`. Here's how you can do it:

```swift
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(style: Color.red) { RedView() }
    }
}

struct RedView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

In this code, `Color.red` is used as the `ShapeStyle`, and `RedView()` is returned from the closure to be used as the fill for the `Circle`. However, this still uses `Color.red` directly, which you said you wanted to avoid.

Unfortunately, there's no way to make a custom `View` conform to `ShapeStyle` without using one of the types that already conform to `ShapeStyle` (like `Color` or `Gradient`) directly. The `ShapeStyle` protocol is not designed to be conformed to by custom types.
