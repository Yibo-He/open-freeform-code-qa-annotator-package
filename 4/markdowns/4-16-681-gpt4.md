Even though all my steps pass successfully , Gitlab CI shows this -
"Cleaning up file based variables
00:01
ERROR: Job failed: exit code 1"
and fails the job at the very end . Also interestingly , this only happens for my master branch . It runs successfully on other branches. Has anyone faced this issue and found a resolution ?

     SERVICE=$(echo "$dir")
     # helm install the service
     fi
     done
    - echo "deployed"
```

This error usually means that one of your scripts is returning a non-zero exit code, which is considered a failure by the shell. Even if all your steps pass successfully, if the final exit code is non-zero, GitLab CI will mark the job as failed.

Here are a few things you can try to debug and fix the issue:

1. **Check your scripts:** Make sure all your scripts are returning a zero exit code upon successful execution. You can do this by appending `|| exit 0` at the end of your scripts.

2. **Check for hidden scripts:** Sometimes, the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file might have hidden scripts that are not visible in the pipeline view. Make sure to check those as well.

3. **Use the `after_script` keyword:** If you want to run some cleanup tasks that should not affect the status of your job, you can use the `after_script` keyword. Scripts defined under `after_script` are run after all jobs have finished and their failure will not affect the job status.

4. **Check the GitLab Runner:** If you're using a specific runner for your master branch, there might be some issues with that runner. Try running the job on a different runner to see if the problem persists.

5. **Check the GitLab CI configuration:** There might be some issues with your GitLab CI configuration that are causing the job to fail. You can use the CI Lint tool in GitLab to check your configuration for errors.

6. **Check the logs:** The error message you're seeing is quite generic and might not give you the exact reason for the failure. Check the logs of your GitLab Runner for more detailed error messages.

Remember, the issue is not with the `echo "deployed"` command, but with the script that is running before it. The `echo "deployed"` command is just the last command that is successfully executed before the job fails.

This error message usually indicates that the script you're running in your GitLab CI job is exiting with a non-zero status code. The non-zero status code means that the command or script has failed in some way.

The issue is likely not with GitLab CI itself, but with the script you're running. It's possible that the script is encountering an error when running on the master branch, but not on other branches.

Here are a few things you can try to debug this issue:

1. **Add `set -e` at the beginning of your script**: This will cause the script to exit immediately if any command exits with a non-zero status. This can help you identify which command is causing the problem.

2. **Add `echo` statements to your script**: This can help you see what's happening at each step of the script. You might be able to identify where the script is failing.

3. **Check the differences between your master branch and other branches**: If the script is only failing on the master branch, there might be something different about that branch that's causing the script to fail. Check the differences between your master branch and other branches to see if you can identify any potential issues.

4. **Check the GitLab CI job logs**: The job logs might contain more detailed information about why the script is failing. You can access the job logs from the GitLab CI/CD dashboard.

5. **Check the exit code of the for loop**: The exit code of the last command executed in the for loop will be the exit code of the whole loop. If the last command in the loop fails, the whole loop (and thus your script) will fail. You can check the exit code of the for loop by adding `echo $?` after the loop. This will print the exit code of the loop.

Remember, the issue is not with GitLab CI, but with the script you're running. The error message is just GitLab CI's way of telling you that your script has failed.

This error usually occurs when a script returns a non-zero exit code. GitLab CI treats any non-zero exit code as a failure. 

In your case, the error might be caused by the `for` loop. If the last iteration of the loop doesn't find a file (i.e., `[[ -f "$dir" ]]` is false), then the exit code of the loop will be the exit code of the last command executed, which is `[[ -f "$dir" ]]`. Since this command returns false, it also returns a non-zero exit code, which GitLab CI interprets as a failure.

To fix this issue, you can add an `exit 0` command at the end of your script. This will ensure that your script always returns a zero exit code, indicating success:

```bash
- >
     for dir in $(git log -m -1 --name-only -r --pretty="format:" "$CI_COMMIT_SHA"); do 
     if [[ -f "$dir" ]]; then 
     SERVICE=$(echo "$dir")
     # helm install the service
     fi
     done
    - echo "deployed"
    - exit 0
```

This should resolve the issue. However, please note that this will also mask any real errors that occur in your script. To avoid this, you might want to add some error handling to your script to catch and handle errors appropriately.
