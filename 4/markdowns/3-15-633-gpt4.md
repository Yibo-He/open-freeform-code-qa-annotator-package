Using a Macro or Formula, is there a way to achieve the result of the following formula of Office 365?
`=FILTER(B:B,A:A = "x")`
What it does is get all the values from `Column B` if `Column A` on the same row has a value of `x`.
My PC has office 365 but the one I'm working with only has `Office Pro Plus 2019`. I had to use my pc when I needed the function and I'm getting tired of it, maybe it can be done on Office Pro Plus 2019 too using a formula or a macro?

In Office Pro Plus 2019, the FILTER function is not available. However, you can achieve the same result using an array formula with INDEX and SMALL functions or using a VBA Macro.

Here is the array formula approach:

1. Suppose you want to filter values from column B where column A is "x", and you want to put the result in column D starting from D2.
2. In cell D2, enter the following array formula:

```excel
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW($A$1)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```

3. Press Ctrl + Shift + Enter to enter the formula as an array formula.
4. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right of the cell) down to copy this formula to other cells in column D.

The formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then using the SMALL function to get the nth smallest value from this array, where n is the row number. The INDEX function then returns the value from column B at this row number.

Here is the VBA Macro approach:

1. Press Alt + F11 to open the VBA editor.
2. Click Insert > Module to create a new module.
3. Copy and paste the following code into the module:

```vba
Sub FilterColumn()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim i As Integer

    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    i = 1

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Cells(i, "D").Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            i = i + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

4. Press Ctrl + S to save and F5 to run the macro.

This macro works by looping through each cell in column A, and if the cell value is "x", it copies the corresponding value from column B to column D.

Remember to replace "Sheet1" with the name of your worksheet, and "A1:A100" and "B1:B100" with your actual ranges.

Yes, you can achieve the same result in Excel 2019 using an array formula or a VBA macro.

Here's how you can do it with an array formula:

1. Suppose you want to put the result in column D, starting from D2. In D2, enter the following formula:
```
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$2:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$2:$A$100="x", ROW($A$2:$A$100)-ROW($A$2)+1), ROW(1:1))), "")
```
2. Press Ctrl+Shift+Enter to enter it as an array formula. Excel will surround the formula with curly braces {} to indicate it's an array formula.
3. Drag the fill handle (the small square at the bottom-right corner of the cell) down to copy the formula to other cells in column D.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x", then using the SMALL function to get the k-th smallest value from this array, where k is the row number of the current cell in column D. The INDEX function then returns the value in column B at this row number.

If you prefer using a VBA macro, here's a simple one that does the same thing:

```vba
Sub FilterColumnA()
    Dim rng As Range, cell As Range
    Dim i As Long

    Set rng = Range("A2:A100")
    i = 2

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            Cells(i, "D").Value = Cells(cell.Row, "B").Value
            i = i + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro loops through each cell in column A, and if the cell's value is "x", it copies the value from the same row in column B to column D. The variable `i` keeps track of the next row in column D to copy to.

Unfortunately, the `FILTER` function is a dynamic array function that is only available in Office 365 and Office 2019. However, you can achieve the same result using a combination of `INDEX` and `SMALL` functions in Office Pro Plus 2019.

Here is the formula you can use:

```
=IFERROR(INDEX($B$1:$B$100, SMALL(IF($A$1:$A$100="x", ROW($A$1:$A$100)-ROW(INDEX($A$1:$A$100,1,1))+1), ROWS($A$1:A1))), "")
```

This formula should be entered as an array formula. After typing the formula, instead of pressing Enter, press Ctrl + Shift + Enter. Excel will surround the formula with curly braces `{}` to indicate it's an array formula.

This formula works by creating an array of row numbers where column A is "x". The `SMALL` function then returns the smallest row number on the first row, the second smallest on the second row, and so on. The `INDEX` function then returns the value from column B for each of these row numbers.

If you have a large dataset and you want to use a VBA macro instead, here is a simple example:

```vba
Sub FilterData()
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
    Dim outputRow As Long

    Set rng = ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet1").Range("A1:A100")
    outputRow = 1

    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "x" Then
            ThisWorkbook.Sheets("Sheet2").Cells(outputRow, "A").Value = cell.Offset(0, 1).Value
            outputRow = outputRow + 1
        End If
    Next cell
End Sub
```

This macro will copy all values from column B to Sheet2 where the corresponding value in column A is "x". You can adjust the range and sheets as needed.
