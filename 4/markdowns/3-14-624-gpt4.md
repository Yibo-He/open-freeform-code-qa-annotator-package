I am getting `Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code` error frequently, The below workarounds which I followed but didn't help me.

: Keychain Access -> Right-click on login -> Lock & unlock again -> Clean Xcode project ->Make build again

 Build Phases -> Targets -> Embedded pods frameworks
                 

: Deleting the derived data

: Clean project and building again.

Find the below log

The error message you're seeing is related to the `swift_lint_check.sh` script, which is failing with a segmentation fault. This script is likely used to perform some sort of linting or style checking on your Swift code.

Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot this issue:

1. **Check the script**: Open the `swift_lint_check.sh` script and check if there's anything in the script that could be causing the segmentation fault. If you're not familiar with shell scripting, you might want to ask for help from someone who is.

2. **Run the script manually**: Try running the `swift_lint_check.sh` script manually from the command line. This might give you more detailed error messages that can help you figure out what's going wrong.

3. **Check the SwiftLint version**: If the `swift_lint_check.sh` script is using SwiftLint to check your code, make sure you're using a version of SwiftLint that's compatible with your version of Swift and Xcode.

4. **Disable the script**: As a last resort, if you can't figure out what's wrong with the script and you don't actually need the linting/style checking it provides, you could disable the script. To do this, go to the "Build Phases" tab in your Xcode project settings, find the "Run Script" phase that's running `swift_lint_check.sh`, and delete it. Be aware, though, that this will disable whatever functionality the script was providing.

Remember to always backup your project before making any major changes.

The error message you're seeing is typically due to a script failing during the build process. In your case, it seems like the script `swift_lint_check.sh` is causing the issue.

Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check the script:** Open the `swift_lint_check.sh` file and check if there's anything in the script that could be causing the issue. Make sure all the paths and commands in the script are correct.

2. **Check the permissions:** Make sure that the script has the correct permissions to run. You can change the permissions of the script by running `chmod +x swift_lint_check.sh` in the terminal.

3. **Run the script manually:** Try running the script manually in the terminal to see if it runs correctly. If it doesn't, the error messages you get might give you a clue as to what's going wrong.

4. **Check your SwiftLint version:** If you're using SwiftLint in your `swift_lint_check.sh` script, make sure you're using a version that's compatible with your Swift version.

5. **Check for SwiftLint errors:** If you're using SwiftLint, make sure your code doesn't have any linting errors that could be causing the script to fail.

6. **Disable the script:** As a last resort, if you can't figure out what's wrong with the script, you can try disabling it to see if that fixes the issue. You can do this by going to the Build Phases tab in your Xcode project, finding the Run Script phase that's running your script, and commenting out the line that runs the script. But keep in mind that this is just a temporary solution and you should try to fix the script as soon as possible.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The error message `Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code` is a general error message that Xcode gives when any script in the "Build Phases" fails. The actual error is `Segmentation fault: 11 ../BuildSupport/swift_lint_check.sh`.

A segmentation fault is a specific kind of error caused by accessing memory that "does not belong to you." It's a mechanism that prevents you from corrupting the memory and introducing hard-to-debug memory bugs. Whenever you get a segmentation fault, you know you are doing something wrong with memory - such as accessing a variable that has already been freed or writing to a read-only portion of memory. The operating system kills the process because it has overstepped its bounds.

From the error message, it seems like the script `swift_lint_check.sh` is causing the segmentation fault. Here are a few things you could try:

1. Check the `swift_lint_check.sh` script: The issue is likely in this script. You could be accessing something that's not available or the script is not compatible with the current environment. Debug this script to see what could be causing the segmentation fault.

2. Check the SwiftLint version: If you are using SwiftLint in `swift_lint_check.sh`, make sure you are using the correct version of SwiftLint that's compatible with your Swift version.

3. Check the shell interpreter: Make sure you are using the correct shell interpreter (bash, sh, zsh, etc.) that's compatible with the script.

4. Check the script permissions: Make sure the script has the correct permissions to execute.

5. Check the script path: Make sure the path to `swift_lint_check.sh` is correct. The error message shows `../BuildSupport/swift_lint_check.sh`, which means the script is expected to be in the `BuildSupport` directory one level up from the current directory.

6. Check the Xcode version: Make sure you are using the correct Xcode version that's compatible with your project.

Remember, the issue is not with Xcode but with the script that's being run. The `Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code` error message is just a symptom of the issue, not the cause.
