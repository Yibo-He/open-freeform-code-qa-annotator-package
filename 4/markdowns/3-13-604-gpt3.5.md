I've recently picked up an Android Studio project I started a year ago in Kotlin.
It features three fragments that can be navigated through by a bottom navigation bar.
Now, to break my current issue down to a simple example that even doesn't work for me:
Given there's a the editText object `exercise` in `fragment_home.xml` and I want to call and alter it in `HomeFragment.kt`.
I checked every source of advice I could find from Google & Stackoverflow and came up with the following code in `HomeFragment.kt` (partially pre-coded by AndroidStudio):
```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        val homeViewModel =
            ViewModelProvider(this).get(HomeViewModel::class.java)

        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        val view: View = inflater!!.inflate(R.layout.fragment_home,container,false)

        view.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")
```

The last line stands for every object I tried to reach. I also tried onClickListening for buttons like so:
```
val btnNewExercise =  view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {view

            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
```

but nothing happens when I start the app/ hit the buttons - I seem to can't get through to the actual view's objects to access them. Even ran into NullPointerExceptions on my way to a solution.
I could supply the fragment and layout files if needed - just thought this way it might be easier at first.
If anybody could tell me where I'm wrong I'd be really grateful! Thanks in advance!

It seems like you are inflating the layout twice, once in the `onCreateView` method and once in the `setOnClickListener` method. You should only inflate the layout once in the `onCreateView` method and then use the `_binding` variable to access the views in that layout.

Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in the `HomeFragment.kt` file:

```
override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        val root: View = binding.root

        // Access the exercise EditText using the _binding variable
        _binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        val btnNewExercise = _binding.btnNewExercise
        btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }

        return root
    }
```

Make sure that you have also defined the `exercise` EditText and `btn_new_exercise` Button in the `fragment_home.xml` layout file and that you have initialized the `_binding` variable at the top of the `HomeFragment.kt` file.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

It seems like you are trying to access the `exercise` EditText before it has been inflated in the view hierarchy. You should be accessing the `exercise` EditText after the view has been inflated in the `onViewCreated` method of the fragment. Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in `HomeFragment.kt`:

```
class HomeFragment : Fragment() {

    private lateinit var binding: FragmentHomeBinding

    override fun onCreateView(
        inflater: LayoutInflater,
        container: ViewGroup?,
        savedInstanceState: Bundle?
    ): View? {
        binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
        return binding.root
    }

    override fun onViewCreated(view: View, savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onViewCreated(view, savedInstanceState)

        binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

        val btnNewExercise = view.findViewById<Button>(R.id.btn_new_exercise)
        btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
            Toast.makeText(view.context, "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
            println("Generated a new exercise")
        }
    }

    override fun onDestroyView() {
        super.onDestroyView()
        _binding = null
    }
}
```

In this example, we are accessing the `exercise` EditText in the `onViewCreated` method after the view has been inflated. We are also setting the click listener for the `btnNewExercise` button in the same method. Make sure to replace `FragmentHomeBinding` with the name of your generated binding class.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

It seems like you are inflating the layout twice, once in the `onCreateView` method and once in the `val view` line. You should remove the `val view` line and use `_binding` to access the views in the layout. Here's an example of how you can access the `exercise` EditText in `HomeFragment.kt`:

```
override fun onCreateView(
    inflater: LayoutInflater,
    container: ViewGroup?,
    savedInstanceState: Bundle?
): View? {
    _binding = FragmentHomeBinding.inflate(inflater, container, false)
    val root: View = binding.root

    _binding.exercise.setText("This is an exceptionally hardcoded string")

    _binding.btnNewExercise.setOnClickListener {
        Toast.makeText(requireContext(), "New exercise will be generated", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
        println("Generated a new exercise")
    }

    return root
}
```

Note that I also changed `view.context` to `requireContext()` in the `Toast.makeText` method, as it's a safer way to get the context in a fragment.
