I'm trying to update my application to Android SDK 31 but I'm having an issue with MediaSessionCompat.
I have a MediaService that extends the MediaBrowserServiceCompat() and in method onCreate of that service I initialise the MediaSessionCompat.
```
override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()
  mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
  }
...
```

But I'm having the following error
```
java.lang.RuntimeException: Unable to create service com.radio.core.service.MediaService: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: com.xxx.xxx: Targeting S+ (version 31 and above) requires that one of FLAG_IMMUTABLE or FLAG_MUTABLE be specified when creating a PendingIntent.
    Strongly consider using FLAG_IMMUTABLE, only use FLAG_MUTABLE if some functionality depends on the PendingIntent being mutable, e.g. if it needs to be used with inline replies or bubbles.

I'm using the most recent version of media library ("androidx.media:media:1.4.0") that is able to handle the this requirement from the Andriod "S"". As it's possible to see in the MediaSessionCompact.java class.
```
// TODO(b/182513352): Use PendingIntent.FLAG_MUTABLE instead from S.
/**
 * @hide
 */
@RestrictTo(LIBRARY)
public static final int PENDING_INTENT_FLAG_MUTABLE = 
  Build.VERSION.CODENAME.equals("S") ? 0x02000000 : 0;

...

if (mbrComponent != null && mbrIntent == null) {
  // construct a PendingIntent for the media button
  Intent mediaButtonIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON);
  // the associated intent will be handled by the component being registered
  mediaButtonIntent.setComponent(mbrComponent);
  mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(context,
    0/* requestCode, ignored */, mediaButtonIntent,
    PENDING_INTENT_FLAG_MUTABLE);
}
```

Do you guys have any idea how can I fix the error?

The error message you're seeing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify mutability for your `PendingIntent`s. This is a new requirement in Android 12 to improve app security.

The AndroidX Media library has been updated to handle this requirement, but it seems like you're still encountering an issue. This might be due to the fact that the library is using the `Build.VERSION.CODENAME` to check the Android version, which is not a reliable way to do it.

As a workaround, you can try to create the `PendingIntent` yourself and pass it to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor that takes a `PendingIntent` as an argument.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```kotlin
override fun onCreate() {
  super.onCreate()

  val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
  mediaButtonIntent.setComponent(ComponentName(this, MediaService::class.java))
  val mbrIntent = if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S) {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE)
  } else {
    PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, 0)
  }

  mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG, mbrIntent, null).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
  }
...
```

This way, you're creating the `PendingIntent` yourself and you're specifying the mutability based on the Android version. You're then passing this `PendingIntent` to the `MediaSessionCompat` constructor.

Please note that this is a workaround and the issue should be properly fixed in a future version of the AndroidX Media library.

## GPT4 Attempt \#1

The issue you're encountering is due to changes in Android 12 (API level 31) regarding PendingIntent mutability. In Android 12 and above, you must explicitly specify whether a PendingIntent is mutable or immutable when you create it.

The error message suggests that the MediaSessionCompat class is trying to create a PendingIntent without specifying the mutability flag, which is not allowed when targeting Android 12 and above.

The issue seems to be in the AndroidX Media library, specifically in the MediaSessionCompat class. As you've pointed out, the library tries to handle the new requirement by using a mutable PendingIntent, but it seems like it's not working as expected.

Unfortunately, as this issue is within the AndroidX library, you can't directly fix it in your code. However, you can try the following workaround:

1. Downgrade your `targetSdkVersion` to 30 in your `build.gradle` file. This will allow your app to bypass the new PendingIntent requirement in Android 12. However, this is only a temporary solution, as you'll eventually need to update your `targetSdkVersion` to meet Play Store requirements.

2. Keep an eye on the AndroidX Media library for updates. The Android team is likely aware of this issue and will probably fix it in a future update. You can check the issue tracker for updates: [Android Issue Tracker](https://issuetracker.google.com/issues)

3. Report the issue to the Android team if it hasn't been reported yet. Providing them with detailed information about the issue will help them fix it faster.

Remember to update your library as soon as a fix is available and test your app thoroughly to ensure the fix works as expected.

## GPT4 Attempt \#2

The issue you're experiencing is due to a change in Android 12 (API level 31) that requires you to specify mutability of your PendingIntent. The Android system needs to know whether the PendingIntent should be mutable (can be changed after being created) or immutable (cannot be changed after being created).

The AndroidX Media library version 1.4.0 indeed has a fix for this issue, but it seems like it's not working as expected. 

As a workaround, you can try to create a MediaButtonReceiver and set it in the manifest file. This receiver will handle the media button events. 

Here's how you can do it:

1. Create a new class that extends `MediaButtonReceiver`:

```kotlin
class MediaButtonIntentReceiver : MediaButtonReceiver() {

    override fun onReceive(context: Context, intent: Intent) {
        super.onReceive(context, intent)
    }
}
```

2. Register this receiver in your manifest file:

```xml
<receiver android:name=".MediaButtonIntentReceiver">
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.intent.action.MEDIA_BUTTON" />
    </intent-filter>
</receiver>
```

3. Pass this receiver to the `MediaSessionCompat`:

```kotlin
val mediaButtonIntent = Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_BUTTON)
mediaButtonIntent.setClass(this, MediaButtonIntentReceiver::class.java)
val mbrIntent = PendingIntent.getBroadcast(this, 0, mediaButtonIntent, if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= Build.VERSION_CODES.S) PendingIntent.FLAG_IMMUTABLE else 0)

mediaSession = MediaSessionCompat(this, TAG, mbrIntent, null).apply {
    setCallback(mediaSessionCallback)
    isActive = true
}
```

This way, the `MediaSessionCompat` will use your `PendingIntent` which has the correct flags set. 

Please note that this is a workaround and the issue should be properly fixed in the AndroidX Media library. You might want to keep an eye on updates to the library and remove this workaround once the issue is resolved.
