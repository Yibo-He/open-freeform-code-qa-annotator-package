I am looking to conform to ShapeStyle, the goal is just conforming to ShapeStyle(Nothing more and nothing less).
Here is my code and the issue:
```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView())
    }
}

struct RedView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Color.red
    }
}
```

So I know I could use `Color.red` directly instead of a view, but as I said, the goal of this question is conformation to ShapeStyle. For those going to share apple developer link about ShapeStyle, I have to say I was there before.
Error:
> Instance method 'fill(_:style:)' requires that 'RedView' conform to 'ShapeStyle'

Main part:
```
public func _apply(to shape: inout SwiftUI._ShapeStyle_Shape) {
    Color.red._apply(to: &shape)  // << here !!
  }
```

Which gives on Xcode 13.3 / iOS 15.4

If you want  to conform to `ShapeStyle`, then @Asperi provided here the answer.
If you want a `Color` to conform to `ShapeStyle` like in your example, it already adopts that protocol, so you just need a little tweak to make it work, like this:
```
struct RedView {
    var render: some ShapeStyle {
        Color.red
    }
}

struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(RedView().render)
    }
}
```

From the documentation for [ShapeStyle](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/shapestyle/):
> You don’t use the `ShapeStyle` protocol directly. Instead, use one of the concrete styles that SwiftUI defines. To indicate a specific color or pattern, you can use `Color` or the style returned by `image(_:sourceRect:scale:)`, or one of the gradient types, like the one returned by `radialGradient(_:center:startRadius:endRadius:)`. To set a color that’s appropriate for a given context on a given platform, use one of the semantic styles, like `background` or `primary`.
I believe what you're trying to do can be achieved with:
```
struct MyContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        Circle()
            .fill(.red)
    }
}
```
