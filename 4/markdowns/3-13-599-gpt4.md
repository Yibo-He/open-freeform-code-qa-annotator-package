What is the recommended solution for creating a NumberPicker Widget in Jetpack Compose?  Similar to the image below.  I am able to create an NumberPicker using an AndroidView within my composable but the view does not seem to allow flings or snap to position.  Btw the UI below shows three NumberPickers placed in a row.  It is not supposed to represent a DatePicker

As of now, Jetpack Compose does not have a built-in NumberPicker widget. However, you can create your own custom NumberPicker using the LazyColumn and ScrollState. Here's a simple example of how you can do it:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NumberPicker(
    range: IntRange,
    selectedValue: MutableState<Int>,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val scrollState = rememberScrollState()

    LazyColumn(
        modifier = modifier,
        state = rememberLazyListState(),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        items(range.toList()) { number ->
            Text(
                text = number.toString(),
                modifier = Modifier
                    .fillMaxWidth()
                    .clickable {
                        coroutineScope.launch {
                            scrollState.animateScrollToItem(number)
                        }
                        selectedValue.value = number
                    },
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                style = if (selectedValue.value == number) {
                    TextStyle(fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold, fontSize = 20.sp)
                } else {
                    TextStyle(fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal, fontSize = 16.sp)
                }
            )
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, a `LazyColumn` is used to display the numbers. When a number is clicked, it becomes the selected value and the list scrolls to that number. The selected number is displayed in bold and larger font size.

You can use this `NumberPicker` in your UI like this:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun MyScreen() {
    val selectedValue = remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
    NumberPicker(range = 0..100, selectedValue = selectedValue)
}
```

This is a very basic example and you might need to adjust it according to your needs. For example, you might want to add animations or customize the appearance of the numbers.

As of now, Jetpack Compose does not provide a built-in NumberPicker widget. However, you can create a custom one using the LazyColumn and ScrollState. Here is an example of how you can create a NumberPicker in Jetpack Compose:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NumberPicker(
    range: IntRange,
    selectedValue: MutableState<Int>,
    modifier: Modifier = Modifier
) {
    val coroutineScope = rememberCoroutineScope()
    val scrollState = rememberScrollState()

    Box(modifier = modifier) {
        LazyColumn(
            modifier = Modifier.fillMaxSize(),
            state = rememberLazyListState(),
            verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
        ) {
            items(range.toList()) { number ->
                Text(
                    text = number.toString(),
                    modifier = Modifier
                        .fillMaxWidth()
                        .clickable {
                            coroutineScope.launch {
                                scrollState.animateScrollToItem(number)
                            }
                        }
                        .padding(16.dp),
                    textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                    style = if (selectedValue.value == number) {
                        TextStyle(fontWeight = FontWeight.Bold, fontSize = 24.sp)
                    } else {
                        TextStyle(fontWeight = FontWeight.Normal, fontSize = 16.sp)
                    }
                )
            }
        }
    }

    LaunchedEffect(scrollState.value) {
        selectedValue.value = (scrollState.value / 56) + range.first
    }
}
```

In this example, we are using a LazyColumn to display the numbers. When a number is clicked, we animate the scroll to that number. We also change the style of the selected number to make it stand out.

You can use this NumberPicker in your code like this:

```kotlin
var selectedNumber by remember { mutableStateOf(0) }
NumberPicker(range = 0..100, selectedValue = remember { mutableStateOf(selectedNumber) })
```

Please note that this is a very basic example and might not cover all your needs. You might need to adjust it according to your requirements. For example, you might want to add fling behavior, snap to the nearest number, etc.

Jetpack Compose does not currently have a built-in NumberPicker widget like the traditional Android View system. However, you can create a custom one using the existing composables. Here is a simple example of how you might create a NumberPicker in Jetpack Compose:

```kotlin
@Composable
fun NumberPicker(
    range: IntRange,
    selectedValue: Int,
    onValueChange: (Int) -> Unit
) {
    val scrollState = rememberScrollState()

    Column(
        modifier = Modifier
            .verticalScroll(scrollState)
            .height(200.dp)
            .width(50.dp)
            .border(1.dp, Color.Black),
        verticalArrangement = Arrangement.Center
    ) {
        range.forEach { number ->
            Text(
                text = number.toString(),
                modifier = Modifier
                    .fillMaxWidth()
                    .clickable { onValueChange(number) },
                textAlign = TextAlign.Center,
                fontSize = if (number == selectedValue) 24.sp else 16.sp,
                color = if (number == selectedValue) Color.Red else Color.Black
            )
        }
    }
}
```

This is a very basic example and does not include fling or snap to position functionality. For a more advanced NumberPicker, you might need to use `LazyColumn` with `LazyListState` to control the scroll position and animate scroll.

Please note that Jetpack Compose is still under active development and the APIs can change. Always check the latest documentation for the most up-to-date information.
