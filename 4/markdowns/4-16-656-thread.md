Is there a way to get the detailed "DESCRIPTION" of the Service? The below cmdlet can provide all of the properties of Windows Service including display name but it is not getting the "Description"

```
Get-Service | select -Property * | Out-GridView
```

Get-Service returns a limited set of information, go to Get-WmiObject win32_service for more:

```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | select * | ogv
```

In the standard Windows PowerShell (version <=5.1)
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | select * | ogv
```

In the Core Powershell Core (version>6)
```
Get-CimInstance  win32_service | ?{$_.Name -like $name} | select Description
```

I also created a [module](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/ProductivityTools.GetServiceDescription) which returns description for given service.
```
Get-ServiceDescription -name $servicename
```

To install module
```
Install-Module -Name ProductivityTools.GetServiceDescription
```

Like say [@mjsqu](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3388954/mjsqu) you can not do that with `Get-Service`, if you want just the description of your service, , you can do that for `ssh-agent` for exemple:
 [@Bacon Bits](https://stackoverflow.com/users/696808/bacon-bits)  `Get-CimInstance`  : [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/54317765/12317483)
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | ?{$_.Name -like 'ssh-agent'} | select Description
```

If you want more informations you can run this command. But if you only want the description of the service launch the command above:
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | ?{$_.Name -like 'ssh-agent'} | select Name, DisplayName, State, PathName, Description
```


---


And if you want this in a window with just the description
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | select Description | ogv
```

But better with services name
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | select Name,Description | ogv
```

and for specific service
```
Get-WmiObject win32_service | ?{$_.NAME -like 'ssh-agent'} | select Name,Description | ogv
```
