Just playing with Swift UI basic app and the preview canvas is not showing even though I'm in canvas mode. App runs, and I have this little snippet what am I missing?

```
#if DEBUG
struct ContentView_Previews : PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
       ContentView()
    }
}
#endif
```

Maybe someone is looking for this:
`Editor -> Canvas (Alt + Command + Enter)`

Or do

### A note about the macOS 


In the mac environment, you can search for any menu option under the  menu, then it will open the exact menu path you are looking for.
For example, searching for vas result in this:

Additionally, if you are using macOS system older than beta version like 10.14 you can use Xcode playground to preview with following code.

```
import PlaygroundSupport
import SwiftUI

    struct ContentView : View {
        var body: some View {
            Text("Hello World")
        }
    }
 PlaygroundPage.current.liveView = UIHostingController(rootView: ContentView())
```

I'm running Xcode 12.2 on Catalina 10.15.7, and I not only need to make sure Canvas is selected but then I need to select Create Preview from the Editor menu.

In , there is a known issue and workaround for views that do not have their certain flags set (see below).

If this applies to you, and you are unable to set the corresponding flags, you may need to remove the `#if debug` flag around `ContentView_Previews` until the issue is fixed in a future Xcode release.

See the [Xcode 11 Beta 6 Release Notes](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode_release_notes/xcode_11_beta_6_release_notes):

> Preview providers that are defined in projects which don’t have `-DDEBUG` set for `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS` and wrapped in `#if DEBUG` don’t display in the canvas. That happens, for example, in Objective-C apps which that never had occasion to specify `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS`. (51138834) Remove the `#if DEBUG` and `#endif` from around the `PreviewProvider` declaration.

I have restarted the Xcode and machine and it's worked for me.
You can try this for many problems.
