I have tried the following:

```
$edge = New-Object -com microsoft-edge.application
$edge.visible = $true
$edge.FullScreen = $true
```


But I get error:

```
New-Object : Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID 
{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000} failed
due to the following error: 80040154 Class not registered (Exception from 
HRESULT: 0x80040154 (REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG)).
At line:1 char:9
+ $edge = New-Object -com microsoft-edge.application
+         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
+ CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [New-Object], COMException
+ FullyQualifiedErrorId : NoCOMClassIdentified,Microsoft.PowerShell.Commands.NewObjectCommand
```


Am I doing something obviously wrong here?

Edit 17/07/2019 - I have changed to below:

```
$edge = Start-Process -FilePath ($Env:WinDir + "\explorer.exe") 
-ArgumentList 
"shell:Appsfolder\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge"
$edge.visible = $true
$edge.FullScreen = $true
```


So now Edge opens but the Visible and Fullscreen commands return errors - anyone have any ideas?

Cheers

I think this might be the solution:

```
start microsoft-edge:http://google.com
$wshell = New-Object -ComObject wscript.shell;
$wshell.AppActivate('Google - Microsoft Edge')
Sleep 2
$wshell.SendKeys('{F11}')
```


I found the above code here:[start microsoft edge in fullscreen](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51617117/start-microsoft-edge-in-fullscreen)

You can send edge different keys depending on what you want:
[How to send CTRL or ALT + any other key?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19824799/how-to-send-ctrl-or-alt-any-other-key)

You could find the key shortcut to whatever you want to do to the Edge window.

You could try this(source is link below):

```
Start-Process -FilePath ($Env:WinDir + "\explorer.exe") -ArgumentList "shell:Appsfolder\Microsoft.MicrosoftEdge_8wekyb3d8bbwe!MicrosoftEdge"
```


There is also a way to open it in Incognito Mode:

You could use the following command to open Microsoft Edge browser and navigate to the special URL.

```
start microsoft-edge:http://google.com
```


Edit: 

If you want to use Edge Webdriver to open IE browser, you could download the Edge webdriver from [this link](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/), and refer to [this article](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webdriver) to use it.

> The existing answers may work for some environments,  they are not guaranteed since they use the alias `start` instead of the `Start-Process` command directly.
[It is best to use the command directly in scripts.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/scripting/when-you-should-use-powershell-aliases/)

```
Start-Process microsoft-edge: -WindowStyle maximized
```


The `Start-Process` command is executed on microsoft-edge, with the argument `-WindowStyle` set to maximized. This will open edge and maximize it to full screen.

---



```
Start-Process microsoft-edge:https://stackoverflow.com -WindowStyle maximized
```


Like before, the `Start-Process` command is executed on microsoft-edge and the `:` specifies to open [https://stackoverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com). The argument `-WindowStyle` set to maximized will full screen Edge and load stackoverflow.com.
