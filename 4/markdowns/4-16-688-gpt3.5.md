In Bash scripts, I frequently find this pattern useful, where I first print the command I'm about to execute, then I execute the command:
```
echo 'Running this cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces'
ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"

echo 'Running this cmd: df -h'
df -h

# etc.
```

Notice the  in the `echo` command to prevent variable expansion there! The idea is that I want to print the cmd I'm running, , then run it!
How do I wrap this up into a function?
Wrapping the command up into a standard bash array, and then printing and calling it, like this,  works:
```
# Print and run the passed-in command
# USAGE:
#       cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
#       print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
# See:
# 1. My answer on how to pass regular "indexed" and associative arrays by reference:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060036/4561887 and
# 1. My answer on how to pass associative arrays: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060913/4561887
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    echo "Running cmd:  ${cmd_array[@]}"
    # run the command by calling all elements of the command array at once
    ${cmd_array[@]}
}
```

For simple commands like this it works fine:
Usage:
```
cmd_array=(ls -a -l -F /)
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Output:
```
Running cmd:  ls -a -l -F /
(all output of that cmd is here)
```

But for more-complicated commands it is broken!:
Usage:
```
cmd_array=(ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces")
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Desired output:
```
Running cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
(all output of that command should be here)
```

Actual Output:
```
Running cmd:  ls -1 /home/gabriel/temp/some folder with spaces
ls: cannot access '/home/gabriel/temp/some': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'folder': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'with': No such file or directory
ls: cannot access 'spaces': No such file or directory
```

The , as you can see, is that `$HOME` got expanded in the `Running cmd:` line, when it shouldn't have, and the double quotes around that path argument were removed, and the  is that the command doesn't actually run.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

To prevent variable expansion and preserve the double quotes around arguments with spaces, you can use single quotes around the entire command string in the array. Then, in the function, you can use `eval` to execute the command string as a whole. Here's an updated version of the function:

```
# Print and run the passed-in command
# USAGE:
#       cmd_array=('ls -a -l -F /' 'df -h')
#       print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
# See:
# 1. My answer on how to pass regular "indexed" and associative arrays by reference:
#    https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060036/4561887 and
# 1. My answer on how to pass associative arrays: https://stackoverflow.com/a/71060913/4561887
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    for cmd in "${array_reference[@]}"; do
        echo "Running cmd:  $cmd"
        eval "$cmd"
    done
}
```

Note that I changed the input array to contain separate command strings instead of a single array with all the commands concatenated together. This allows for more flexibility in case you want to run different commands with different options or arguments.

Usage:

```
cmd_array=('ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"' 'df -h')
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Output:

```
Running cmd:  ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"
(all output of that command should be here)
Running cmd:  df -h
(all output of that command should be here)
```

As for your follow-up question, you can use the same approach with single quotes around the entire command string. Here's an example:

```
cmd_array=('ls -l | grep myfile' 'echo "Hello, world!"')
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

Output:

```
Running cmd:  ls -l | grep myfile
(all output of that command should be here)
Running cmd:  echo "Hello, world!"
Hello, world!
```

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

To prevent variable expansion in the `echo` command, you can use single quotes around the entire string, like this:
```
echo 'Running cmd:  ${cmd_array[@]}'
```

To fix the issue with the `$HOME` variable getting expanded, you can use double quotes around the command when you call it, like this:
```
"${cmd_array[@]}"
```

Here's the updated function:
```
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    echo "Running cmd:  ${array_reference[@]}"
    # run the command by calling all elements of the command array at once
    "${array_reference[@]}"
}
```

This should work for commands with spaces and variables.

As for your follow-up question, you can use the same approach to print and run a command array with the pipe operator. Here's an example:
```
cmd_array=(ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces" | grep some)
print_and_run_cmd cmd_array
```

This should print and run the command `ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces" | grep some` correctly.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

To prevent variable expansion in the `echo` command, you can use single quotes around the entire string, like this:

```
echo 'Running this cmd: ls -1 "$HOME/temp/some folder with spaces"'
```

To wrap this up into a function, you can modify your existing function to use `printf` instead of `echo`, and to use `eval` to execute the command:

```
print_and_run_cmd() {
    local -n array_reference="$1"
    printf 'Running cmd: %s\n' "${array_reference[*]}"
    eval "${array_reference[*]}"
}
```

The `${array_reference[*]}` syntax expands the array into a single string, with each element separated by a space. This ensures that any quotes or other special characters in the command are preserved.

Note that using `eval` can be dangerous if you're not careful about how you construct the command array. Make sure you don't include any user input in the array without properly sanitizing it first.
