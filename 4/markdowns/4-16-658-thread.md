I'm trying to run Docker in process isolation mode on Windows Server 2019 (Docker Desktop does not work here, my VPS does not support Hyper-V).
I run this in PowerShell (all in Administrator mode)
`docker run -it --isolation=process mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2019 cmd.exe /c ping 127.0.0.1 -t`
Then I get error:
> docker: error during connect: In the default daemon configuration on Windows, the docker client must be run with elevated privileges to connect.: Post http://%2F%2F.%2Fpipe%2Fdocker_engine/v1.24/containers/create: open //./pipe/docker_engine: The system cannot find the file specified.
See 'docker run --help'.
I ran command `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon`, as suggested here: [Docker cannot start on Windows](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40459280/docker-cannot-start-on-windows)
However, `DockerCli.exe` does not exist in a clean Docker install:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sCcAr.png)
As [suggested here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58179462/where-do-i-find-dockercli-exe) I tried copying the file `DockerCli.exe` from my local Windows 10 Docker Desktop installation and reran, but then I get:
> Unhandled Exception: System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'Docker.Core, Version=3.0.0.50646, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Run(IReadOnlyCollection`1 args)
at Docker.Cli.MainBackendCli.Main(String[] args)
Regardless, copying files from Docker Desktop does not feel like the right approach.
I then ran `dockerd` in PowerShell since that's the only other executable in that folder:

Since I'm a newbie, I'm not sure if I just started a container and if so, which one, I just see `start.`, but no idea where that comes from or how I can configure it.

Based on Peter Wishart's suggestion I tried `uninstall-Package -Name docker`, but then I get
```

The pipe access that the error message mentions is a (probably unrelated) issue when `docker` client is run by non-admin users (see [here](https://www.axians-infoma.de/techblog/allow-access-to-the-docker-engine-without-admin-rights-on-windows/)).
I think the most likely explanation is that the docker service has failed to start.
When you ran `dockerd` you were actually  - and the line `API listen on //./pipe/docker_engine` means that the system service hadn't started previously - as the instance you started could create the pipe.
If you stop the running `dockerd` instance and run:
```
Get-Service docker | Restart-Service
 Get-WinEvent -logname application | where ProviderName -eq docker | sort TimeCreated
```

You should be able to compare the log output with your manual start of `dockerd`, and see if any errors are blocking the service from starting.
If the event log records `API listen on //./pipe/docker_engine` then `Get-Service docker` should show the service as running, and your `docker` commands should be ok.
[Edit]
Looks like the uninstall of docker was failing because the service doesn't exist.
Yet, the install is succeeding except for the service installation.
You can re-register the service with `&'C:\Program Files\Docker\dockerd.exe' --register-service`
Maybe this will fail if the VPS provider is somehow stopping services from being registered?
Another option is to run docker interactively in one shell with `&'C:\Program Files\Docker\dockerd.exe' --run-service`, and run your docker commands in another shell.

To resolve the issue, I just ran `& 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon` in PowerShell and quit the Docker desktop and Run Docker Desktop as administrator.
Now open command prompt or powershell and run `docker images` or `dockers ps` command. It should work.

Go to PowerShell > run as administrator and run this code:
```
cd "C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker"
./DockerCli.exe -SwitchDaemon
```

To resolve the issue, I just ran  Two Steps in PowerShell.
First,
```
cd 'C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker
```

and then,
```
/DockerCli.exe' -SwitchDaemon
```

After that, install the WSL Kernel on your machine, restart the WSL machine, then it is resolved.

Ok so i followed 2 steps and my problem was resolved:

1. update wsl kernel, seamingly it is a must because docker needs it and it is not installed by default. so just close all docker realated stuff and run:


```
wsl --update
```

command in cmd .

1. I did what other guys said here:


```
C:\Program Files\Docker\Docker\DockerCli.exe -SwitchDaemon
```

and voila!

One other thing to check is whether you have started the Desktop Client for Windows and accepted the License Agreement.  I had restored from an image that hadn't had Docker started and was seeing this error.  Nothing worked until I accepted the license.
