I want to find out total system boot time by subtracting two timestamps. 
First I use this command to get the start time and end time:

```
sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}'
```


which gets me the following output:

```
2020-05-21 05:52:47 2020-05-28 19:37:36
```


(The first two fields being the start time and the last two fields being the end time)

Now I want to find the difference between the start time and end time, preferably in the format:

"0 year(s), 0 month(s), 7 day(s), HH:MM:SS"

You can use the `date` command to convert the start and end timestamps to seconds since the epoch, and then subtract them to get the total number of seconds. You can then use some simple arithmetic to convert this to the desired format. Here's an example script that does this:

```
#!/bin/bash

# Get start and end timestamps
timestamps=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}')
start=$(echo $timestamps | awk '{print $1" "$2}')
end=$(echo $timestamps | awk '{print $3" "$4}')

# Convert timestamps to seconds since epoch
start_seconds=$(date -d "$start" +%s)
end_seconds=$(date -d "$end" +%s)

# Calculate difference in seconds
diff_seconds=$((end_seconds - start_seconds))

# Calculate years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds
years=$((diff_seconds / 31536000))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 31536000))
months=$((diff_seconds / 2592000))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 2592000))
days=$((diff_seconds / 86400))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 86400))
hours=$((diff_seconds / 3600))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 3600))
minutes=$((diff_seconds / 60))
seconds=$((diff_seconds % 60))

# Print result
echo "$years year(s), $months month(s), $days day(s), $(printf "%02d:%02d:%02d" $hours $minutes $seconds)"
```

This script first gets the start and end timestamps using the command you provided. It then uses the `date` command to convert these timestamps to seconds since the epoch. It calculates the difference in seconds between the two timestamps, and then uses some simple arithmetic to convert this to years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Finally, it prints the result in the desired format.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

You can use the following command to calculate the difference between the start time and end time:

```
start_time="2020-05-21 05:52:47"
end_time="2020-05-28 19:37:36"
duration=$(($(date -d "$end_time" +%s) - $(date -d "$start_time" +%s)))
printf '%d year(s), %d month(s), %d day(s), %02d:%02d:%02d\n' $(($duration/31536000)) $(($duration%31536000/2592000)) $(($duration%2592000/86400)) $(($duration/3600%24)) $(($duration/60%60)) $(($duration%60))
```

Replace the `start_time` and `end_time` variables with the output you got from the previous command.

This will give you the duration in the format you specified.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

You can use the `date` command to convert the start and end timestamps to Unix timestamps, which are the number of seconds since January 1, 1970. Then you can subtract the two Unix timestamps to get the total number of seconds between the two timestamps. Finally, you can convert the total number of seconds to the desired format using the `date` command again.

Here's an example command that should do what you want:

```
start=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}' | awk '{print $1" "$2}')
end=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}' | awk '{print $3" "$4}')
start_timestamp=$(date -d "$start" +%s)
end_timestamp=$(date -d "$end" +%s)
total_seconds=$((end_timestamp - start_timestamp))
years=$((total_seconds / 31536000))
months=$((total_seconds / 2592000))
days=$((total_seconds / 86400))
hours=$((total_seconds / 3600))
minutes=$((total_seconds / 60))
seconds=$((total_seconds % 60))
echo "$years year(s), $months month(s), $days day(s), $(printf "%02d:%02d:%02d" $hours $minutes $seconds)"
```

This command first extracts the start and end timestamps from the output of `sudo journalctl`, and converts them to Unix timestamps using the `date` command. It then calculates the total number of seconds between the two timestamps, and uses that to calculate the number of years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Finally, it prints the result in the desired format.
