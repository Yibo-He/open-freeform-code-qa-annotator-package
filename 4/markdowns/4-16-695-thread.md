I just got a MacBook from work and I am using it to build docker images. Usually, the docker build shows the full log (i.e. `ls -la` showing the cwd). Thats at least what I'm used to from my linux machine.
On the macbook however, it only shows a brief overview: (actual console output)

Steps 7 and 15 are supposed to show me the results, but this is just omitted. (I know, its the cached result, but it didn't show up, when  I changed the Dockerfile and rebuild the layer as well).
setting `--progress=plain`  didn't do any good. In fact it just changed the color from purple to white (HideThePainHarold.jpg).
Any help will be greatly appreciated.

Found the answer myself: Apparently Docker build on osx is automatically config'd to use buildkit, which disguises a lot of the default debug output.
I removed it from the JSON config and it works.

Just set export DOCKER_BUILDKIT=0 in your shell....

In addition to [Simons Answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/66664355/3288890), if you are looking for permanent setting.
To disable docker BuildKit by default, set daemon configuration in `/etc/docker/daemon.json` feature to true and restart the daemon:
```
{ "features": { "buildkit": false } }
```
