(I am using MAC)
My id_rsa starts with
```
-----BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY-----
```

but I expect it to starts with
```
-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
```

I have send my id_rsa.pub to server administrator to get the access to server, so I don't want to generate a new key.

1. Is there any way that I can transfer my id_rsa which is a openssh private key to a RSA private key? (command please.)
2. If I can transfer, do I also need to transfer id_rsa.pub? (command please.) It seems id_rsa.pub doesn't have a header like id_rsa, so I am not sure if I should also transfer this.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#0

1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then allow you to choose a new passphrase (if desired). The resulting key will be in PEM format and will start with `-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----`.

2. Yes, you should also transfer your id_rsa.pub file to the server administrator, as this is the public key that corresponds to your private key. You can simply copy the contents of the file and provide it to the administrator. The lack of a header in the id_rsa.pub file is not an issue, as it is still a valid public key.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#1

1. Yes, you can convert your OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key using the following command:

```
ssh-keygen -p -m PEM -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

This command will prompt you to enter your current passphrase for the key, and then it will ask you to enter a new passphrase (you can leave this blank if you don't want a passphrase). After that, your key will be converted to RSA format and saved in the same file.

2. You don't need to transfer your id_rsa.pub file, as it is just the public key that corresponds to your private key. The server administrator should already have your public key on the server, so you can use your newly converted RSA private key to access the server without any issues.

## GPT3.5 Attempt \#2

1. Unfortunately, it is not possible to convert an OpenSSH private key to an RSA private key. The two formats are not interchangeable. You will need to generate a new RSA private key if that is the format required by the server.

2. If you do generate a new RSA private key, you will also need to generate a new public key (id_rsa.pub) and send it to the server administrator. The public key is used by the server to authenticate you when you connect using your private key. The format of the public key does not matter, as long as it matches the format expected by the server.
