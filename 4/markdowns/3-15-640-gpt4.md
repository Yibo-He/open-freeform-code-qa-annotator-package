I have a workbook that was saved yesterday afternoon, and was working perfectly. I have opened it this morning, and none of the modules in the VBE are 'found'. Visually I can see them all sitting there.

When trying to open any of these modules to edit the code, the windows are greyed out, as below.

When I try exporting the code modules, I get the 'Module Not Found' errror.

Does anyone know a) why this has happened, and b) how can I fix this?
I thought initially it was the instance of my Excel, so have restarted the PC.
Any help is appreciated!

This issue can occur due to various reasons such as corruption in the workbook, issues with Excel, or problems with the VBA project. Here are some steps you can try to fix this issue:

1. **Recompile the VBA project**: Go to the VBA editor (Alt + F11), then Debug > Compile VBAProject. If there are any issues with the code, this should highlight them.

2. **Save the workbook as .xlsb**: Sometimes, saving the workbook as .xlsb (Excel Binary Workbook) and then reopening it can resolve the issue.

3. **Export and Import Modules**: Try to export the modules, then delete them from the project, and import them again. This can sometimes fix issues with the VBA project.

4. **Repair Excel**: If the issue persists, it might be a problem with Excel itself. You can try to repair your Office installation (Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features > Microsoft Office > Change > Repair).

5. **Use a Previous Version**: If you have a backup or a previous version of the workbook, try using that.

6. **Use a VBA Code Recovery Tool**: There are tools available online that can help recover VBA code from corrupted workbooks. You can try using one of these if none of the above solutions work.

Remember to always keep a backup of your workbooks to prevent data loss.

This issue might be due to corruption in your Excel workbook. Here are some steps you can try to recover your VBA modules:

1. **Try to Open and Repair the Workbook**: Open Excel, go to File > Open, navigate to your workbook, but don't open it yet. Instead, click on the arrow next to the Open button, and select Open and Repair.

2. **Save the Workbook in a Different Format**: Open the workbook, then go to File > Save As, and choose a different format like Excel Binary Workbook (.xlsb) or Excel 97-2003 Workbook (.xls). After saving, close the workbook and reopen it in the new format.

3. **Import the Modules into a New Workbook**: If you can still see the modules in the VBA editor, try to export them (right-click on the module > Export File). Then, create a new workbook and import the modules (right-click in the Project Explorer of the VBA editor > Import File).

4. **Use a VBA Code to Export the Modules**: If you can't manually export the modules, you can use a VBA code to do it. Here's an example:

    ```vba
    Sub ExportAllCode()
        Dim wb As Workbook
        Dim obj As Object
        Dim i As Integer

        Set wb = ThisWorkbook
        i = 1

        With wb.VBProject
            For Each obj In .VBComponents
                Select Case obj.Type
                    Case vbext_ct_ClassModule, vbext_ct_MSForm, vbext_ct_StdModule
                        obj.Export "C:\YourPath\" & obj.Name & i & ".cls"
                        i = i + 1
                End Select
            Next obj
        End With
    End Sub
    ```
    This code will export all your modules, class modules and userforms into .cls files. You can then import these files into a new workbook.

5. **Use a Third-Party Tool**: If none of the above methods work, you might need to use a third-party tool to recover your workbook. There are several tools available online, both free and paid.

Remember to always keep a backup of your workbooks to prevent data loss.
