I want to find out total system boot time by subtracting two timestamps. 
First I use this command to get the start time and end time:

```
sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}'
```


which gets me the following output:

```
2020-05-21 05:52:47 2020-05-28 19:37:36
```


(The first two fields being the start time and the last two fields being the end time)

Now I want to find the difference between the start time and end time, preferably in the format:

"0 year(s), 0 month(s), 7 day(s), HH:MM:SS"

You can use the `date` command in Linux to convert the timestamps to seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), subtract the start time from the end time to get the difference in seconds, and then convert this difference to the desired format.

Here is a script that does this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the start and end times
times=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}')
read start end <<< $times

# Convert the timestamps to seconds since the Unix epoch
start_sec=$(date --date="$start" +%s)
end_sec=$(date --date="$end" +%s)

# Calculate the difference in seconds
diff_sec=$((end_sec - start_sec))

# Calculate the number of days, hours, minutes, and seconds
days=$((diff_sec / 86400))
hours=$((diff_sec / 3600 % 24))
minutes=$((diff_sec / 60 % 60))
seconds=$((diff_sec % 60))

# Calculate the number of months and years
months=$((days / 30))
years=$((days / 365))

# Subtract the number of months and years from the number of days
days=$((days - months * 30 - years * 365))

# Print the difference in the desired format
printf "%d year(s), %d month(s), %d day(s), %02d:%02d:%02d\n" $years $months $days $hours $minutes $seconds
```

Please note that this script assumes that a month has 30 days and a year has 365 days, which is not always true. If you need more accurate results, you may need to use a more sophisticated method to calculate the number of months and years.

You can use the `date` command in Linux to convert the timestamps to seconds since the Unix epoch (1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), subtract them to get the difference, and then convert the difference back to a human-readable format. Here is a bash script that does this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the start and end times
output=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}')
start_time=$(echo $output | awk '{print $1" "$2}')
end_time=$(echo $output | awk '{print $3" "$4}')

# Convert the times to seconds since the Unix epoch
start_seconds=$(date --date="$start_time" +%s)
end_seconds=$(date --date="$end_time" +%s)

# Calculate the difference
diff_seconds=$((end_seconds - start_seconds))

# Convert the difference back to a human-readable format
diff_days=$((diff_seconds / 86400))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 86400))
diff_hours=$((diff_seconds / 3600))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 3600))
diff_minutes=$((diff_seconds / 60))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 60))

echo "0 year(s), 0 month(s), $diff_days day(s), $diff_hours:$diff_minutes:$diff_seconds"
```

This script assumes that the start and end times are in the local time zone. If they are in UTC, you should use `date --utc --date="$start_time" +%s` and `date --utc --date="$end_time" +%s` to convert them to seconds.

Also, this script does not calculate the number of years and months between the start and end times. If you need this, you will have to add some additional logic, because the number of days in a year and a month can vary.

You can use the `date` command to convert the timestamps to Unix time (seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC), subtract them, and then convert the result to the desired format. Here's a bash script that does this:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Get the start and end times
times=$(sudo journalctl | grep "Logs begin at" | awk '{print $6" "$7" "$12" "$13}')
start_time=$(echo $times | awk '{print $1" "$2}')
end_time=$(echo $times | awk '{print $3" "$4}')

# Convert to Unix time
start_seconds=$(date --date="$start_time" +%s)
end_seconds=$(date --date="$end_time" +%s)

# Find the difference
diff_seconds=$((end_seconds - start_seconds))

# Convert to the desired format
diff_days=$((diff_seconds / 86400))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 86400))
diff_hours=$((diff_seconds / 3600))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 3600))
diff_minutes=$((diff_seconds / 60))
diff_seconds=$((diff_seconds % 60))

echo "0 year(s), 0 month(s), $diff_days day(s), $(printf "%02d" $diff_hours):$(printf "%02d" $diff_minutes):$(printf "%02d" $diff_seconds)"
```

This script assumes that the start and end times are always in the same year and month. If this is not the case, you would need to add code to calculate the number of years and months.
