SwiftUI has wonderful animation features, but the way it handles changes in `Text` View content is problematic. It animates the change of the text frame but changes the text immediately without animation. As a result, when the content of a `Text` View is made longer, animating the transition causes an ellipsis (â€¦) to appear until the text frame reaches its full width. For example, in this little app, pressing the  button switches between shorter and longer text:
[](https://i.stack.imgur.com/sQrT2.gif)
Here's the code:
```
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var shortString = true
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(shortString ? "This is short." : "This is considerably longer.").font(.title)
                .animation(.easeInOut(duration:1.0))
            Button(action: {self.shortString.toggle()}) {
                Text("Toggle").padding()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

The question is: how to avoid the ellipsis? When animating a one character string into a two character string the situation is even worse, because the short string is completely replaced by the ellipsis while it animates into the longer string.
One possibility is to assign a separate id to the view in one state or another by adding the modifier, for instance, `.id(self.shortString ? 0 : 1)` and then adding a `.transition()` modifier. That will treat the Text as two different Views, before and after. Unfortunately, in my case I need to move text location during the change, and different ids makes animating that impossible.
I guess the solution is a creative use of `AnimatableData`. Any ideas?

You're correct that SwiftUI's default behavior for animating changes in `Text` views can be problematic. The ellipsis issue you're seeing is due to SwiftUI's default behavior of animating the frame of the text, but not the text content itself.

To avoid the ellipsis, you can use a custom `AnimatableModifier` to animate the changes in the text content. This will allow you to control the animation of the text content separately from the animation of the frame.

Here's an example of how you can do this:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct AnimatableText: AnimatableModifier {
    var text: String
    var progress: Double

    var animatableData: Double {
        get { progress }
        set { progress = newValue }
    }

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        Text(text)
    }
}

extension View {
    func animatableText(_ text: String, progress: Double) -> some View {
        self.modifier(AnimatableText(text: text, progress: progress))
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var shortString = true
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            if shortString {
                Text("This is short.")
                    .font(.title)
                    .animatableText("This is short.", progress: shortString ? 0 : 1)
                    .animation(.easeInOut(duration:1.0))
            } else {
                Text("This is considerably longer.")
                    .font(.title)
                    .animatableText("This is considerably longer.", progress: shortString ? 0 : 1)
                    .animation(.easeInOut(duration:1.0))
            }
            Button(action: {self.shortString.toggle()}) {
                Text("Toggle").padding()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this code, `AnimatableText` is a custom `AnimatableModifier` that takes a `text` string and a `progress` value. The `progress` value is used as the `animatableData`, which is what SwiftUI uses to animate changes in the modifier.

The `animatableText(_:progress:)` function is an extension on `View` that applies the `AnimatableText` modifier to the view.

In the `ContentView`, we use an `if` statement to switch between the short and long text. For each text, we apply the `animatableText(_:progress:)` function with the appropriate text and progress value. The progress value is `0` when `shortString` is `true`, and `1` when `shortString` is `false`. This causes SwiftUI to animate the changes in the text content when `shortString` is toggled.

You're correct that SwiftUI's default behavior for animating changes in a `Text` view can be problematic. However, you can work around this by creating a custom `AnimatableModifier` that will animate the changes in the `Text` view's width.

Here's an example of how you might do this:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var shortString = true
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(shortString ? "This is short." : "This is considerably longer.")
                .font(.title)
                .modifier(WidthAnimatingModifier(shortString: $shortString))
            Button(action: {self.shortString.toggle()}) {
                Text("Toggle").padding()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct WidthAnimatingModifier: AnimatableModifier {
    @Binding var shortString: Bool
    var animatableData: CGFloat {
        didSet {
            shortString = animatableData < 0.5
        }
    }

    init(shortString: Binding<Bool>) {
        self._shortString = shortString
        self.animatableData = shortString.wrappedValue ? 0 : 1
    }

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content.frame(width: animatableData * UIScreen.main.bounds.width)
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this code, `WidthAnimatingModifier` is a custom `AnimatableModifier` that animates changes in the width of the `Text` view. It uses a `Binding` to the `shortString` state variable to determine the width of the `Text` view. When `shortString` is `true`, the width is 0, and when `shortString` is `false`, the width is the full width of the screen.

The `animatableData` property is used to animate changes in the width. When `animatableData` changes, it updates `shortString`, which in turn updates the width of the `Text` view.

This approach should give you a smooth animation of the `Text` view's width without any ellipsis appearing.

Yes, you're right. A creative use of `AnimatableData` can solve this problem. You can create a custom `Text` view that uses `AnimatableModifier` to animate the change in the text.

Here's an example of how you can do it:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    @State var shortString = true
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            AnimatedText(text: shortString ? "This is short." : "This is considerably longer.")
                .font(.title)
                .animation(.easeInOut(duration:1.0))
            Button(action: {self.shortString.toggle()}) {
                Text("Toggle").padding()
            }
        }
    }
}

struct AnimatedText: View {
    var text: String

    var body: some View {
        Text(text)
            .modifier(AnimatedTextModifier())
    }
}

struct AnimatedTextModifier: AnimatableModifier {
    var pct: CGFloat = 0

    var animatableData: CGFloat {
        get { pct }
        set { pct = newValue }
    }

    func body(content: Content) -> some View {
        content.opacity(Double(1 - pct))
    }
}

struct ContentView_Previews: PreviewProvider {
    static var previews: some View {
        ContentView()
    }
}
```

In this example, `AnimatedText` is a custom `Text` view that uses `AnimatedTextModifier` to animate the change in the text. The `AnimatedTextModifier` uses `AnimatableModifier` to animate the opacity of the text. When the text changes, the opacity of the old text decreases from 1 to 0, and the opacity of the new text increases from 0 to 1. This creates a cross-fade effect between the old and new text.

Please note that this is a simple example and might not cover all your needs. You might need to adjust it according to your specific requirements.
