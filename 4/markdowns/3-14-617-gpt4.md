Command `PhaseScriptExecution` failed with a `nonzero` exit code

I deleted derived data.
i have tried :  

> keychain access -> right click on login -> lock & unlock again ->
  clear Xcode project

Restarted machine, no use

How do I resolve "`Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code`" error when trying to archive project. 

And I am using those librarys 

```
pod 'IQKeyboardManagerSwift'
pod 'SDWebImage', '~> 4.0'
pod 'KRPullLoader'
pod 'Paytm-Payments'
```

The error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" is a generic error message that Xcode gives when any script phase fails. The actual error could be anything that causes the script to return a non-zero exit code.

Here are some steps you can try to resolve the issue:

1. **Check your build phases:** Go to your target's build phases and check if there are any scripts that are causing the issue. If there are any custom scripts, make sure they are working as expected.

2. **Check your dependencies:** Since you are using CocoaPods, make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed. Try running `pod deintegrate` and `pod install` again.

3. **Check your code signing settings:** Sometimes this error can be caused by incorrect code signing settings. Make sure you have the correct provisioning profile selected and that your certificate is valid.

4. **Clean and rebuild your project:** Try cleaning your project (Shift + Command + K) and rebuilding it (Command + B).

5. **Update Xcode:** If none of the above solutions work, it could be an issue with Xcode itself. Try updating Xcode to the latest version.

6. **Check the error details:** The error message should have more details about what exactly failed. Check the error details to get more information about what is causing the issue.

If none of these solutions work, please provide more details about the error so I can give a more specific solution.

The error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" is a common error in Xcode and can be caused by a variety of issues. Here are a few things you can try:

1. **Check your script**: The error message suggests that a script you're running in the "Build Phases" of your Xcode project is failing. Check any scripts you have there for errors.

2. **Check your dependencies**: Make sure all your dependencies are correctly installed and updated. You can do this by running `pod install` or `pod update` in your terminal.

3. **Check your certificates**: This error can sometimes be caused by issues with your certificates. Try refreshing your certificates in Xcode by going to Xcode > Preferences > Accounts, selecting your Apple ID, and clicking on "Download Manual Profiles".

4. **Clean and rebuild your project**: Try cleaning your project (Shift + Command + K) and then rebuilding it (Command + B).

5. **Check your code signing settings**: Make sure your code signing settings are correct. Go to your target's settings, select "Build Settings", and check the "Code Signing Identity" and "Provisioning Profile" settings.

6. **Update Xcode**: If none of the above solutions work, the problem might be with Xcode itself. Try updating to the latest version of Xcode.

7. **Check for spaces in the directory path**: Sometimes, having spaces in the directory path can cause this issue. If there are spaces, try removing them or enclosing the path in quotes.

8. **Check your Podfile**: Make sure that the Podfile is correctly configured and that all the dependencies are correctly listed.

If none of these solutions work, you might need to provide more information or error messages to further diagnose the problem.

The error "Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code" is a common error in Xcode and can be caused by various issues. Here are some steps you can try to resolve this issue:

1. **Check your code signing settings:** Make sure you have the correct provisioning profile selected and that your signing certificate is valid. 

2. **Check your build phases:** The error message indicates that the error occurred during the "PhaseScriptExecution" phase. This is a phase where custom scripts specified by you or your project's dependencies are run. Check if there are any scripts specified in your project's "Build Phases" tab that could be causing the issue.

3. **Check your dependencies:** You mentioned that you are using several libraries. It's possible that one of these libraries is causing the issue. Try removing them one by one to see if the error persists. If the error disappears after removing a library, then that library is likely the cause of the issue.

4. **Clean your project:** Try cleaning your project (Product -> Clean Build Folder) and then build again.

5. **Update Cocoapods:** Sometimes, updating Cocoapods can solve the issue. You can update Cocoapods by running `sudo gem install cocoapods` in the terminal.

6. **Check your Swift version:** Make sure that all your libraries are compatible with the Swift version you are using. Some libraries may not be compatible with newer versions of Swift.

7. **Check for hidden characters:** Sometimes, hidden characters in the script can cause this issue. Make sure there are no hidden characters in your script.

If none of the above solutions work, please provide more details about the error message and the script that is causing the issue.
