I have data in a file where one column is a date column which has date in the following format:
```
2021-05-10T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-14T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-05-19T18:25:00.000+0100
```


```
10 MAY 2021
14 MAY 2021
19 MAY 2021
```


```
while -r read line
do
    year=`echo $line | awk '{ print $1 }' `
    month=`echo $line | awk '{ print $2 }' `
    dt=`echo $line | awk '{ print $3 }' `

    v=$dt"-"$month"-"$year
    d=date '`$v' | dd-mm-yyyy
    echo $d
done < /f/filename.txt
```

You have a number of syntax and design problems in your attempt.
I don't particularly recommend using the shell for this; the other answers with plain `date` and Awk and Perl etc solutions are definitely better for this particular task, both in terms of usability and readability as well as performance. But there are scenarios where you do want or need to use the shell, and then it's important to understand what the proper syntax looks like.
For the record, then, the shell is perfectly capable of splitting the input line on whitespace, or whatever `IFS` is set to, into variables.
You also had some peculiar typos in your `d` assignment.  I'm guessing wildly here as to what you actually meant.
```
while IFS='-T' read -r year month dt _;
do
    date -d "$year-$month-$dt" +"%d %b %Y"
done < /f/filename.txt
```

`d=date whatever` would assign the literal string `date` to the variable `d` and then attempt to run `whatever` as a command, and probably fail. But of course, creating a variable only so that you can then immediately `echo` it is just a [useless use of echo.](http://www.iki.fi/era/unix/award.html#echo)
`date -d` is a GNU variation; on *BSD (including macOS) you'd need something like `date -j -f %Y-%m-%d +"%d %b %Y" 2021-05-28`
I don't think `strftime` offers an uppercase version of the month name; if SHOUTING is important to you, maybe pipe to
```
done <file | tr a-z A-Z
```

The format code `%b` is locale-dependent; if you want to force English (or legacy) month names, try `LC_TIME=POSIX date` (notice now how we use the syntax I explained above!)

The GNU coreutils `date` command supports the input format you have, e.g.:
```
date -f filename.txt +'%d %b %Y'
```

Output:
```
10 May 2021
14 May 2021
19 May 2021
```

Pipe it through `tr a-z A-Z` if you want it in all-caps.
Note: tested with version 8.30 of GNU coreutils.

With your sample, please try the following:
```
awk -F'[T-]' '
BEGIN{
  num=split("Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sept,Oct,Nov,Dec",month,",")
}
{
  mon=substr($2,2,1)
}
(mon in month){
  print $3,month[mon],$1
}
' Input_file
```

OR try following:
```
awk -F'[T-]' '
BEGIN{
  num=split("Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sept,Oct,Nov,Dec",month,",")
}
($2+0 in month){
  print $3,month[$2+0],$1
}
' Input_file
```

 Adding detailed explanation for the code above:
```
awk -F'[T-]' '             ##Starting awk program from here and setting field separator as - OR T here for all Lines.
BEGIN{                     ##Starting BEGIN section of this program here.
  num=split("Jan,Feb,Mar,Apr,May,Jun,Jul,Aug,Sept,Oct,Nov,Dec",month,",") ##Creating month array here which has month names here.
}
{
  mon=substr($2,2,1)       ##Creating variable mon, which has sub string of 2nd field with 1st character.
}
(mon in month){            ##Checking if mon is present in month then do following.
  print $3,month[mon],$1   ##Printing 3rd field, month value 1st field.
}
' Input_file               ##Mentioning Input_file name here.
```

Using `gnu-awk`, this can be done in a single line:
```
awk '{
print toupper(strftime("%d %b %Y", mktime(gensub(/[-:T]/, " ", "g"))))
}' file

10 MAY 2021
14 MAY 2021
19 MAY 2021
```

Or without `gensub`:
```
awk -F '[-:T]' '{$1=$1; print toupper(strftime("%d %b %Y", mktime($0)))}' file
```

Another approach:
```
awk -F'[T-]' 'BEGIN{                         
                mon="JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec"

              # if need uppercase use below variable
              # mon="JANFEBMARAPRMAYJUNJULAUGSEPOCTNOVDEC"
              }
              {
                print $3,substr(mon,($2*3)-2,3), $1
              }' file
```

Test Results:
Input:
```
$ cat file 
2021-01-10T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-02-14T18:25:00.000+0100

2021-11-19T18:25:00.000+0100
2021-12-19T18:25:00.000+0100
```

Output :
```
$ awk -F'[T-]' 'BEGIN{mon="JanFebMarAprMayJunJulAugSepOctNovDec"}{print $3,substr(mon,($2*3)-2,3), $1}' file

With `perl`:
```
$ perl -MTime::Piece -lne '$t = Time::Piece->strptime(substr($_,0,10), "%F");
                           print $t->strftime("%d %b %Y")' ip.txt
10 May 2021
14 May 2021
19 May 2021
```

- `substr($_,0,10)`- `%F``%Y-%m-%d`- `%d %b %Y`- [https://perldoc.perl.org/Time::Piece](https://perldoc.perl.org/Time::Piece)

I used two statements for readability, single statement version shown below:
```
perl -MTime::Piece -lne 'print Time::Piece->strptime(substr($_,0,10), "%F")->strftime("%d %b %Y")'
```
